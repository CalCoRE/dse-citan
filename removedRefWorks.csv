MANY TEACHERS’ PREPARATION FOR AND EXPERIENCES TEACHING STATISTICAL MODELING HAVE FOCUSED ON PROBABILISTIC MODELS. SUBSEQUENTLY, MUCH OF THE RESEARCH LITERATURE RELATED TO THE TEACHERS’ UNDERSTANDING HAS FOCUSED ON PROBABILISTIC MODELS. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE EXTENT TO WHICH SECONDARY STATISTICS TEACHERS APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND IDEAS OF STATISTICAL MODELING, SPECIFICALLY THE PROCESSES OF MODEL BUILDING AND EVALUATION, WHEN INTRODUCED USING CLASSIFICATION TREES, A TYPE OF ALGORITHMIC MODEL. RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT WHILE TEACHERS WERE ABLE TO READ AND BUILD CLASSIFICATION TREE MODELS, THEY EXPERIENCED MORE DIFFICULTY WHEN EVALUATING MODELS. FURTHER RESEARCH COULD CONTINUE TO EXPLORE POSSIBLE LEARNING TRAJECTORIES, TECHNOLOGY TOOLS, AND PEDAGOGICAL APPROACHES FOR USING CLASSIFICATION TREES TO INTRODUCE IDEAS OF STATISTICAL MODELING. © 2021 THE AUTHOR(S).

THE SECOND AUTHOR FRAMED THE FIRST AUTHOR'S ARTICLE REFLECTIONS IN TERMS OF THEIR CONNECTIONS TO SKT AND SKT2. DRAWING UPON OUR COLLABORATIVE ANALYSIS, WE PROPOSE STRATEGIES TO HELP JSDSE MORE FULLY REALIZE ITS POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO SKT AND SKT2. WE EXPLAIN HOW ACTING ON THE PROPOSED STRATEGIES MAY HELP JSDSE READERS, AUTHORS, AND EDITORS BRIDGE THE PERSISTENT HISTORICAL GAP BETWEEN FORMAL SCHOLARSHIP AND PRACTICE IN K-12 EDUCATION.","ASSESSMENT; CURRICULUM; EDUCATION; PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE; PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT; STATISTICAL KNOWLEDGE FOR TEACHING","KNOWLEDGE; LITERACY",NA,NA,"*AM STAT ASS, 2007, US STAT EFF MATH ED;ARNOLD P, 2021, J STAT DATA SCI EDUC, V29, P122, DOI 10.1080/26939169.2021.1877582;ARNOLD T., 1993, J STAT EDUC, V1, P1, DOI 10.1080/10691898.1993.11910456, DOI 10.1080/10691898.1993.11910456;ASHLEY C, 2019, J STAT EDUC, V27, P138, DOI 10.1080/10691898.2019.1688595;BARGAGLIOTTI A., 2020, PRE K 12 GUIDELINES;BRISBIN A, 2019, J STAT EDUC, V27, P154, DOI 10.1080/10691898.2019.1637801;BURKE J, 2020, J STAT EDUC, V28, P326, DOI 10.1080/10691898.2020.1841589;CAMPBELL H, 2017, J STAT EDUC, V25, P131, DOI 10.1080/10691898.2017.1381055;COLLEGE BOARD, 2020, AP ART DES COURS EX;EDWARDS C.M., 2020, MATH TEACHER LEARNIN, V113, P442, DOI 10.5951/MTLT.2020.0090, DOI 10.5951/MTLT.2020.0090;ENGLISH L.

BACKGROUND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED APPRECIATION OF DATA AS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY STRATEGIC RE-SOURCE. THIS HAS RESULTED IN A GREATER NEED FOR SKILLS IN DATA SCIENCE TO EXTRACT MEANINGFUL INSIGHTS FROM DATA. HOWEVER, THE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR DATA SCIENCE SKILLS. WHILE THERE IS GROWTH IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS, THEY APPEAR MORE AS A REBRANDING OF EXISTING ENGINEERING, COMPUTER SCIENCE, MATHEMATICS, AND STATISTICS PROGRAMS. METHODOLOGY A SCOPING REVIEW WAS ADOPTED FOR THE PERIOD 2010-2021 USING SIX SCHOLARLY MULTIDISCIPLINARY DATABASES: GOOGLE SCHOLAR, IEEE XPLORE, ACM DIGITAL LI-BRARY, SCIENCEDIRECT, SCOPUS, AND THE AIS BASKET OF EIGHT JOURNALS. THE STUDY WAS NARROWED DOWN TO 91 RESEARCH ARTICLES AND ADOPTED A CLASSIFICATION CODING FRAMEWORK AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS FOR ANALYSIS. CONTRIBUTION WE THEORETICALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWING BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE NEED TO SCALE UP DATA SCIENCE THROUGH MULTIDISCIPLINARY PEDAGOGIES AND DISCIPLINES AS THE DEMAND GROWS. THIS PAVES THE WAY FOR FUTURE RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND WHICH PROGRAMS CAN PROVIDE CURRENT AND FUTURE DATA SCIENTISTS THE SKILLS AND COMPE-TENCIES RELEVANT TO SOCIETAL NEEDS. FINDINGS THE KEY RESULTS REVEALED THE LIMITED EMPHASIS ON DSE, ESPECIALLY IN NON-STEM (SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS) DISCIPLINES. IN ADDITION, THE RESULTS IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO FIND A SUITABLE PEDAGOGY OR A SET OF PEDAGOGIES BECAUSE OF THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY NATURE OF DSE. FURTHER, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO EXISTING FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF DSE AT VARIOUS ED-UCATION LEVELS, LEADING TO SOMETIMES INADEQUATE PROGRAMS. THE STUDY ALSO NOTED THE IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS DSE AND THUS CREATE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE DSE ECOSYSTEM. MOST OF THE RESEARCH STUDIES REVIEWED WERE CASE STUDIES THAT PRESENTED MORE STEM PROGRAMS AS COMPARED TO NON-STEM. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCHERS WE RECOMMEND CROSS INDUSTRY STANDARD PROCESS FOR DATA MINING (CRISP -DM) AS A FRAMEWORK TO ADOPT COLLABORATIVE PEDAGOGIES TO TEACH DATA SCIENCE. THIS RESEARCH IMPLIES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ACADEMIA, POLICYMAKERS, AND DATA SCIENCE CONTENT DEVELOPERS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH ORGANIZATIONS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS. WE RECOMMEND FUTURE RESEARCH INTO PROGRAMS THAT CAN PROVIDE CURRENT AND FU-TURE DATA SCIENTISTS THE SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES RELEVANT TO SOCIETAL NEEDS AND HOW INTERDISCIPLINARITY WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE INTEGRATED. IMPACT ON SOCIETY DATA SCIENCE EXPERTISE IS ESSENTIAL FOR TACKLING SOCIETAL ISSUES AND GENERATING BENEFICIAL EFFECTS. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT DATA IS DIVERSE AND ALWAYS CHANGING, NECESSITATING ONGOING (UP)SKILLING. ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS MUST THEREFORE STAY CURRENT WITH NEW ADVANCES, CHANGING DATA, AND ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. IN-DUSTRY EXPERTS MIGHT SHARE VIEWS BASED ON THEIR PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE. THE DSE ECOSYSTEM CAN BE SHAPED BY COLLABORATING WITH NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS AND BE-ING AWARE OF EACH STAKEHOLDER'S FUNCTION IN ORDER TO ADVANCE DATA SCIENCE INTER-NATIONALLY. FUTURE RESEARCH THE STUDY FOUND THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES THAT CAN BE EXPLORED TO IMPROVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DSE, FOR INSTANCE, HOW CAN CRISP -DM BE INTEGRATED INTO COLLABORATIVE PEDAGOGIES TO PROVIDE A FULLY COMPREHEN-SIVE DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM?","DATA SCIENCE APPLICATIONS IN EDUCATION; PEDAGOGY; TEACHING; LEARNING STRATEGIES; TRANSDISCIPLINARY PROJECTS; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION","BIG DATA; REQUIREMENTS; BUSINESS",NA,NA,"ANDERSON PAUL E., 2014, 2014 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE).

TRAINING IN QUANTITATIVE METHODS AND REASONING IS CRITICAL FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS IN BIOMEDICAL AND SCIENCE PROGRAMS TO FOSTER REPRODUCIBLE AND RESPONSIBLE RESEARCH PRACTICES. WE ARGUE THAT GRADUATE STUDENT EDUCATION SHOULD MORE CENTER AROUND FUNDAMENTAL REASONING AND INTEGRATION SKILLS RATHER THAN MAINLY ON LISTING 1 STATISTICAL TEST METHOD AFTER THE OTHER WITHOUT CONVEYING THE BIGGER CONTEXT PICTURE OR CRITICAL ARGUMENTATION SKILLS THAT WILL ENABLE STUDENT TO IMPROVE RESEARCH INTEGRITY THROUGH RIGOROUS PRACTICE. HEREIN, WE DESCRIBE THE APPROACH WE TAKE IN A QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSE IN THE R3 PROGRAM AT THE JOHNS HOPKINS BLOOMBERG SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, WITH AN ERROR-FOCUSED LENS, BASED ON VISUALIZATION AND COMMUNICATION COMPETENCIES. SPECIFICALLY, WE TAKE THIS PERSPECTIVE STEMMING FROM THE DISCUSSED CAUSES OF IRREPRODUCIBILITY AND APPLY IT SPECIFICALLY TO THE MANY ASPECTS OF GOOD STATISTICAL PRACTICE IN SCIENCE, RANGING FROM EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN TO DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS, AND CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THE DATA.
