AI) paradigm that aims at broadening participation in data science education and enhancing undergraduate students’ data literacy. The core of the paradigm is the “Tell Stories” approach. This approach applies the 5W+1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How) conceptual schema of stories as a transdisciplinary language for data science education for STEM and non-STEM majors. Accordingly, this study reported findings from the OCEL.AI project that implemented and evaluated the paradigm. A field experiment, in addition to classroom observations, was conducted to compare the learning outcomes of students in data science competence, appreciation, career motivation, life-long willingness to learn, and self-efficacy in data science between the treatment group and the control group. The results showed that the OCEL.AI paradigm improved undergraduates’ data science competence and career motivation despite majors or gender. © 2023","Cooperative/collaborative learning; Data science applications in education; Improving classroom teaching; Interdisciplinary projects; Teaching/learning strategies",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1935076","This study is supported and funded by the National Science Foundation CUE Ethics: Open Collaborative Experiential Learning (OCEL.AI).

In this paper, we discuss the centrality of API (application programming interface) lookup to data wran-gling, and how an ontology-structured command menu could facilitate it. We design thumbnail graphics as visual alternatives to explaining data wrangling operations and use a survey to validate their quality. We furthermore predict that thumbnail graphics make the menu more navigable, improving lookup e_ciency and performance. Our predictions are tested using Slice N Dice, an online data wrangling tutorial platform that collects learner activity. It includes both non-programmatic and programmatic data wrangling exercises. Participants from a multi-institutional sample (n=200) were randomly assigned the tutorial either with or without thumbnail graphics. Our results show that thumbnail graphics reduce the need for clari_cations, thereby assisting API lookup for novices learning data wrangling. We further present some negative results regarding performance gain and follow up with a discussion on why the di_erences are subtle and how they can be improved. Last but not least, we complement our statistical results with a qualitative study where we receive positive feedback from our participants on the design and helpfulness of the thumbnail graphics. © American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

Further, the increased availability of large-scale electronically accessible data sets is an untapped area of study. This interpretive study examined middle school students' understanding of statistical concepts involved in making a plan to collect data to answer a statistical question within a social issue context using data available on the internet. Student artifacts, researcher notes, and audio and video recordings from nine groups of 20 seventh-grade students in two gifted education pull-out classes at a suburban middle school were used to answer the study research questions. Data were analyzed using a priori codes from previously developed frameworks and by using an inductive approach to find themes. Three themes that emerged from data related to confirmation bias. Some middle school students held preconceptions about the social issues they chose to study that biased their statistical questions. This in turn inuenced the sources of data students used to answer their questions. Confirmation bias is a serious issue that is exacerbated due to endless sources of data electronically available. We argue that this type of bias should be addressed early in students' educational experiences. Based on the findings from this study, we other recommendations for future research and implications for statistics and data science education. © American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

A wide range of data science competencies and skills development and 12 knowledge topics covered by the curriculum were obtained. The humanistic model is further taken as the theoretical and methodological basis for course model construction, and 12 course knowledge topics are reconstructed into 4 course modules, including (a) data-driven methods and techniques; (b) domain knowledge; (c) legal, moral, and ethical aspects of data; and (d) shaping and developing personal traits, and human-centered data science graduate curriculum model is formed.

Our study examined policies and professional autonomy with a focus on dilemmas encountered in everyday work by data managers. We found that dilemmas arose at every stage of the research data lifecycle, and legacy data presents particularly vexing challenges. The iFields' emphasis on knowledge organization and representation provides insight into how data, used by scientists, are used to create knowledge. The iFields' disciplinary emphasis also encompasses the sociotechnical complexity of dilemmas that we found arise in research data management. Therefore, we posit that iSchools are positioned to contribute to data science education by teaching about ethics and infrastructure used to collect, organize, and disseminate data through problem-based learning. © 2022 The Authors.

This article seeks to build on existing literature concerned with the sociopolitical, cultural, and ethical dimensions of data science education by considering the salience of two interrelated concepts discussed in Asian and Asian American studies and postcolonial studies: techno-Orientalism and the Filipino mimicry stereotype. These concepts describe the positioning of Asians and Asian Americans, and Filipinos in particular, as performance machines who are adept at copying the ideas of dominant groups but incapable of innovation themselves. This article situates techno-Orientalism and the Filipino mimicry stereotype within broader conversations around postcolonial data politics and then argues for the possibility of including these concepts in data science education curricula. Finally, this article discusses Gaskins’s techno-vernacular creativity as one path for resisting techno-Orientalist and mimicry discourses. © 2023, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.","Asian; Asian American; Data science education; Postcolonialism; Race",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bargagliotti, A., Franklin, C., Arnold, P., Gould, R., Johnson, S., Perez, L., Spangler, D.A., (2020) PreK-12 guidelines for assessment and instruction in statistics education II (GAISE II): A framework for statistics and data science education, , American Statistical Association and National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; Benjamin, R., (2019) Race after technology: Abolitionist tools for the new Jim code, , Polity Press; Bhabha, H., Of mimicry and man: The ambivalence of colonial discourse (1984) October, 28, pp. 125-133; Buolamwini, J., Gebru, T., Gender shades: Intersectional accuracy disparities in commercial gender classification (2018) Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency, pp. 77-91; Burke, L.E.C.A., Wallace, J., Re-examining postcolonial science education within a power-knowledge framework: A Caribbean case study (2020) Science & Education, 29, pp. 571-588; Conway, D., The data science Venn diagram (2010) Retrieved March 8, 2023, From, , http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram; Couldry, N., Mejias, U.A., Data colonialism: Rethinking big Data’s relation to the contemporary subject (2019) Television & New Media, 20 (4), pp. 336-349; D’Ignazio, C., Klein, L., (2020) Data feminism, , The MIT Press; About the coalition Retrieved March 8, 2023, From, , https://www.datascience4everyone.org/about; De Kosnik, A., Perfect covers: Filipino musical mimicry and transmedia performance (2017) Verge: Studies in Global Asias, 3 (1), pp. 137-161; de Laat, P.B., The disciplinary power of predictive algorithms: A Foucauldian perspective (2019) Ethics and Information Technology, 21, pp. 319-329; Draper, E.B., Data science job growth in 2021 and beyond (2020) The Commons.

The move is prompted by research that shows data science is a great tool to broaden participation in CS because it offers students an opportunity to apply their computing knowledge to socially relevant problems. Broadening participation, particularly among underrepresented students, is critical to the future health and stability of the field. However, data science is still a relatively new in the context of K-12 schools and few CS teachers are pedagogically trained in data science. In order to test whether or not data science can be a tool to increase student representation in CS and help schools implement more data science curriculum, our project partnered with a local school district to modify an existing data science unit. This work explores the process of how our research practice partnership tackled the development of the new data science unit. © 2022 Owner/Author.","data science; data science education; middle school","Curricula; Data Science; Feedback; Broadening participation; CS education; Data science education; K-12 schools; Middle school; Science education; Student feedback; Teacher feedback; Teachers'; Underrepresented students; Students",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 2122485","This work is supported by the National Science Foundation Award #2122485.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to reveal the reality of data science education in the Middle East and to determine the opportunities and challenges for teaching data science in the region. Thirteen countries in the Middle East were offering 48 data science programmes at the time of the study. The results reveal that these data science programmes significantly use the words ‘data’ and ‘analytics’ in their names. With regard to the academic affiliations of the data science programmes, the study found that they are offered in a variety of schools, especially computer science, information technology and business. Moreover, the study found that computer science is the dominant trend in the programmes. Data science programmes have a significant overlap with other programmes, especially statistics and computer science, because of the interdisciplinary nature of this field. Data science schools in the Middle East differ in terms of their programme titles, programme descriptions, course catalogues, curriculum structures and course objectives. Broadly, this study may be useful for those who are seeking to establish a data science programme or to strengthen data science curricula at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. © The Author(s) 2021.","Arabian Gulf countries; curriculum analysis; data analytics; Data science; data science education; Middle East",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aasheim, C.L., Williams, S., Rutner, P., Data analytics vs data science: A study of similarities and differences in undergraduate programs based on course descriptions (2015) Journal of Information Systems Education, 26 (2), pp. 103-115; (2022) Master of Science in Business Analytics, , https://adsm.ac.ae/programs/master-of-science-in-business-analytics, accessed 10 May 2022; Agarwal, R., Dhar, V., Big data, data science, and analytics: The opportunity and challenge for IS research (2014) Information Systems Research, 25 (3), pp. 443-448; Ahmad, K., Zheng, J., Rafi, M., An analysis of academic librarians competencies and skills for implementation of big data analytics in libraries: A correlational study (2019) Data Technologies and Applications, 53 (2), pp. 201-216; (2022) Bachelor degree in data science and artificial intelligence, , https://fit.ammanu.edu.jo/En/ProgramIntro.aspx?id=13&17, accessed 30 April 2022; Alarcón-Soto, Y., Espasandín-Domínguez, J., Guler, I., (2019), https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04486, Data science biomedicine,, accessed 30 April 2022; Artandi, S., (1972) An Introduction to Computers in Information Science, , Metuchen, NJ, Scarecrow Press; Barlas, P., Lanning, I., Heavey, C., A survey of open source data science tools (2015) International Journal of Intelligent Computing and Cybernetics, 8 (3), pp. 232-261; Bennett, T.D., Callahan, T.J., Feinstein, J.A., Data science for child health (2019) Journal of Pediatrics, 208, pp. 12-22; Borne, K.D., Jacoby, S., Carney, K., (2009) The revolution in astronomy education: Data science for the masses, , http://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.3895v1.pdf, accessed 20 May 2022; Bussaban, K., Waraporn, P., Preparing undergraduate students majoring in computer science and mathematics with data science perspectives and awareness in the age of big data (2015) Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences, 197, pp. 1443-1446; Calzon, B., (2021) Why data driven decision making is your path to business success.

In this exploratory study, we aimed to understand (a) what apt epistemic processes within data literacy look like in practice with children, and (b) to what extent a curriculum built on a simulation-based data analysis intervention (where students engage in experimentation and data analyses through the use of simulations) promotes the epistemic processes of data literacy. We used the Apt-AIR framework, which expounds on the components needed for successful epistemic education, as a tool to identify students’ apt epistemic processes. The results illustrate that elementary students were able to activate cognitive, emotional, and—to a lesser extent—metacognitive and collaborative epistemic processes related to data literacy skills in this context. Additionally, the design features embedded in the experimentation lesson were more successful in engaging students in apt epistemic processes; yet the data analysis lesson, while engaging students in fewer processes overall, was successful in promoting students’ ability to make accurate inferences using an aggregate view of data. We discuss the trends in the apt epistemic processes related to data literacy that emerged and their implications for instruction and learning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Apt-AIR Framework; Data Science Education; Informal Statistical Inference; Simulations",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1513043","This research was largely funded by the National Science Foundation, grant number 1513043, and, in part, by the Litzsinger Road Ecology Foundation.

As a result, there is a growing body of research regarding how to teach interdisciplinary collaboration skills. However, much of the work evaluating methods of teaching statistics and data science collaboration relies primarily on self-reflection data. Additionally, prior research lacks detailed methods for assessing the quality of collaboration skills. In this case study, we present a method for teaching statistics and data science collaboration, a framework for identifying elements of effective collaboration, and a comparative case study to evaluate the collaboration skills of both a team of students and an experienced collaborator on two components of effective data science collaboration: structuring a collaboration meeting and communicating with a domain expert. Results show that the students could facilitate meetings and communicate comparably well to the experienced collaborator, but that the experienced collaborator was better able to facilitate meetings and communicate to develop strong relationships, an important element for high-quality and long-term collaboration. Further work is needed to generalize these findings to a larger population, but these results begin to inform the field regarding effective ways to teach specific data science collaboration skills. © 2023 The Author(s).

In this exploratory study, we characterize the attitudes and experiences of 672 undergraduate students as they used our online textbook as part of a 10-week introductory course in statistics. Students expressed negative attitudes and concerns related to R at the beginning of the course, but most developed more positive attitudes after engaging with course materials, regardless of demographic characteristics or prior programming experience. Analysis of a subgroup of students revealed that change in attitudes toward R may be linked to students’ patterns of engagement over time and students’ perceptions of the learning environment. © 2022 The Author(s).

Although various tools and services such as Jupyter Notebook and Google Cloud's AI have been developed for building and training models, they are not suitable for direct use in educational settings. For example, teachers expect a platform where they can easily distribute and grade programming assignments, and students want to quickly start coding and training models without the burden of setting up an environment. To this end, we develop MLadder, an online training system for machine learning and data science education. Specifically, we seamlessly integrate two open-source software, CodaLab and Jupyter Notebook, which are used for hosting assignments and building models, respectively. Moreover, we devise several methods to make the system lightweight and scalable, so that it can be deployed on-premises even with limited resources. We have used MLadder in the machine learning and data science courses in our school and facilitated both teaching and learning. © 2022 ACM.","educational support; kubernetes; machine learning education; online systems","Data Science; E-learning; Education computing; Machine learning; Open source software; Open systems; Teaching; Building model; Educational support; Kubernetes; Machine data; Machine learning education; Machine-learning; Online training; Science education; Training model; Training Systems; Online systems",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 62137001","This work is supported by the grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62137001).",,,,,,,,,,"Bernstein, D., Containers and cloud: From lxc to docker to kubernetes (2014) IEEE Cloud Computing, 1 (3), pp. 81-84. , 2014; Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L., Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database (2009) 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition.

One of the key reasons for student attrition is the inability of students to develop an identity and a sense of belonging. This study aims to understand the role of a data science learning community in helping students to develop identity and a sense of belonging. The study used a mixed-methods approach to collect and analyze the data. The study used a pre–post survey to understand students’ perceptions regarding identity formation and sense of belonging. The results of the survey study indicated that the perception of identity formation and sense of belonging increased as students progressed through the semester. To further investigate the reasons for the increase in the perception of identity formation and sense of belonging, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted. The results of the interview revealed that living in the data science learning community, participating in various events and interacting with faculty, staff and working with peers of similar interest helped students to develop a data science identity and leader identity, as well as experience sense of belonging. © 2022 by the authors.","communities of practice; data science education; identity formation; learning community; sense of belonging; undergraduate education",,,,,,"Lilly Endowment","This research was supported in part by the Lilly Endowment Charting the Future Phase I Planning Grant, through the Purdue Office of the Provost.

Given that DS is highly interdisciplinary and individual institutions have various academic structures, creating a new DS program needs to consider many factors. This poster details the process of how to create an undergraduate DS minor program with considerations of the following key questions: (1) What is the general background of DS education landscape and iSchools? (2) What is the institutional context of DS education, i.e., what are gaps in the institutional DS education? How does the proposed program fit in and distinguish itself from other DS programs on campus? (3) How to navigate the DS approval process with multiple DS programs on campus? This work will help those who plan to create and revise a DS program that benefits students and fits in the broad DS education landscape and their own institution. 85th Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology | Oct. 29 – Nov. 1, 2022 | Pittsburgh, PA.

The lectures on these topics cannot stand alone without coding practice on real-world data sets. Some instructors prefer to utilize small data sets for practice in classroom or assignments, which limits experimental experiences and may even bring misleading experiences to students. Others may try to assign large data sets to students, but students may not be able to bear with the running time due to the efficiency issue raised by several factors (e.g., data size, algorithm complexity, computing power, etc.). In this paper, we first learned students' preferences on the scalability of data sets for practice in data science courses, and performed experimental analysis by running different data science algorithms over both student laptops and personal/office computers, in order to deliver a suggestion about the appropriate data size for practice in multiple scenarios (e.g., in-class practice, assignments, class projects, research projects, etc.).

Data feminism is an approach that draws on feminist scholarship and action to humanize data and contend with the relationships between data and power. In this review paper, we draw on principles from data feminism to review 42 different educational research and design approaches that engage youth with data, many of which are educational technology intensive and bear on future data-intensive educational technology research and design projects. We describe how the projects engage students with examining power, challenging power, elevating emotion and lived experience, rethinking binaries and hierarchies, embracing pluralism, considering context, and making labour visible. In doing so, we articulate ways that current data education initiatives involve youth in thinking about issues of justice and inclusion. These projects may offer examples of varying complexity for future work to contend with and, ideally, extend in order to further realize data feminism in K-12 data science education. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Data feminism is an emergent framework for changing data practices and discourse in service of equity and justice. Data science education is rapidly growing as a topic of interest in the educational technology research and design communities. Many educational technology and design projects have been launched and shared in publications that preceded the widespread distribution of the data feminism framework. What this paper adds Data feminism is partially re-articulated in terms familiar to educational technology research communities. Prior and recent projects are organized with respect to how they illustrate potential connections to core data feminism principles. This paper identifies specific strategies that recent projects have used that have potential for realizing data feminism principles. Implications for practice and/or policy Educational technologists can use the re-articulated principles of data feminism for education to inform their future design work. Tractable steps to achieve data justice that are attainable within existing educational systems can be pursued. Communities can and should bring together multiple ways of knowing to support new educational practices and futures with data. © 2022 The Authors.

However, the actual techniques learners need to become proficient in are still somewhat “in-construction”, as the relatively new field of data science is constantly expanding to meet new data-related demands. Data science education needs to develop innovative means to keep up with this expansion that focus less on proficiency in specific techniques, but rather introduce novices to authentic data practices, and the authentic purposes directing the authentic practices. This paper focuses on a specific practice, the use of simulations to generate and examine data, in the context of authentic scientific Citizen Science research. We provide a case study of one pair of middle school students' engagement in an extended learning sequence including simulation activities inspired by authentic data practices, adapted to also be authentic for young students. While the simulation activity was inspired by the scientists' purposes, our findings illustrate four different actual purposes the students attributed to it. We also show that as the students deepened their engagement with the simulation, they gradually appropriated its intended purpose, alongside articulating more mature views of data-related concepts. The conclusions summarize the four different purposes the students expressed and identify aspects of design that contributed to the gradual re-shaping process of their actual purposes. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Introducing students to data science and statistics has become essential nowadays. Students need to be introduced to authentic data practices, but also to the authentic purposes motivating these practices. Utilizing computerized simulations is a common authentic practice in science and statistics. The pedagogical, intended, use of computerized simulations can be inspired by the authentic purposes but should also be adapted to be authentic for the students. Students may have actual purposes that differ from the authentic and intended purposes. What this paper adds A case study of a pair of middle school students' engagement with a computerized simulation tool, as part of their participation in a Citizen Science project. The students expressed four actual purposes for the simulation. The students' initial purposes differed from the intended purposes, limiting their participation. Key aspects of the overall activity design ultimately supported the students to appropriate the intended purpose of the simulation and more deeply engage with the intended statistical notions. Implications for practice and/or policy It is important to consider that students may attribute purposes that differ from those of the teacher or the activity designer, to any learning activity they engage in. Making the intended purposes more explicit may be helpful, but potentially not enough for students to appropriate them. Researchers' prompts, students' freedom to reshape their use of the simulation tool and productive discussion norms can be beneficial aspects. © 2022 The Authors.

This paper focuses on the role of data science and analytics education to improve the students' computing and analytical skills across a range of domain-specific problems. The paper studies four examples of data-intensive STEM projects for supervised undergraduate research experiences (SURE) in Mechanical Engineering, Biomedical science, Quantum Physics, and Cybersecurity. The developed projects include the applications of data science for improving additive manufacturing, automating microscopy images analysis, identifying the quantum optical modes, and detecting network intrusion. The paper aims to provide some guidelines to effectively educate the next generation of STEM undergraduate and graduate students and prepare STEM professionals with interdisciplinary knowledge, skills, and competencies in data science. The paper includes a summary of activities and outcomes from our research and education in the field of data science and machine learning.

We'll discuss both the design and implementation of such a course, including the programming language features that support it and the educational research that informs it. © 2022 Owner/Author.","computing education; data science education","Curricula; Education computing; Computing education; Data science education; Design and implementations; Introductory course; Language features; Non-trivial; Science education; Science projects; Social impact of computing; Traditional computers; Data Science",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"CPO: The pyret Programming Environment, , http://code.pyret.org, [n.d.]; CSCI 0111-Computing Foundations: Data, , https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0111/, [n.d.]. course at Brown University; (2022), https://www.pyret.org/, [n.d.] Accessed: - 05-6; https://racket-lang.org/, [n.d.]; Castro, F.E.V., Fisler, K., On the interplay between bottom-up and datatype-driven program design (2016) Proceedings of the 47th ACM Technical Symposium on Computing Science Education (SIGCSE '16), pp. 205-210. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2839509.2844574, ACM, New York, NY, USA; Castro, F.E.V., Fisler, K., Qualitative analyses of movements between task-level and code-level thinking of novice programmers (2020) Proceedings of the 51st ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE '20), pp. 487-493. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366847, Association for Computing Machinery, Portland, OR, USA; Dyer, T., Nelson, T., Fisler, K., Krishnamurthi, S., Applying cognitive principles to model-finding output: The positive value of negative information (2022) ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages and Applications.; Felleisen, M., Bruce Findler, R., Flatt, M., Shriram, K., (2001) How to Design Programs, , http://www.htdp.org/, MIT Press; Fisler, K., Castro, F.E.V., Sometimes, rainfall accumulates: Talk-alouds with novice functional programmers (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research (ICER '17), pp. 12-20. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3105726.3106183, ACM, New York, NY, USA; Fisler, K., Shriram, K., Lerner, B.S., Politz, J.G., (2021) A Data-Centric Introduction to Computing, , https://dcicworld.org/, Published on-line accessed 2021-12-29; Gu, X., Heller, M.A., Li, S., Ren, Y., Fisler, K., Shriram, K., Using design alternatives to learn about data organizations (2020) SIGCSE International Computing Education Research Conference.; Jackson, D., (2006) Software Abstractions, , MIT Press; Krishnamurthi, S., Fisler, K., Data-centricity: A challenge and opportunity for computing education (2020) Commun.

In recent years, machine learning (ML) 's surging impact has sparked discourse about the importance of AI education for young people, and in recent years, several initiatives and projects pursuing the mission of K-12 AI education have emerged. In 2020 Israel's Ministry of Education (MoE) approved a new comprehensive and rigorous ML curriculum targeting 11 and 12th-grade pupils majoring in computer science (CS). The curriculum is meant to be taught by the existing CS teacher workforce. However, since ML theory and practice are fundamentally different from traditional CS [2], implementing this thorough ML curriculum poses substantial challenges in developing an effective teaching workforce to deliver it. In this research, we suggest a solution for this challenge in the form of a blended-learning (BL) program. The online component of this program is based mainly on Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization MOOCs series [3]. The BL program, enhanced with pedagogical training, is also used for the professional development (PD) of the teachers who deliver the program. Out of fourteen CS teachers who participated in the PD in the summer of 2021, ten teach the BL program this year to 273 high-school pupils. Initial results demonstrate the achievement of the curriculum learning goals and provide compelling preliminary evidence that this program enables CS teachers who are new to machine learning to teach this thorough curriculum effectively © 2022 ACM.","artificial intelligence education; blended-learning; computer science education; data science education; K-12 AI education; machine learning education; MOOCs","Deep learning; Education computing; Learning systems; Personnel training; Artificial intelligence education; Blended learning; Computer Science Education; Data science education; K-12 AI education; Learning projects; Machine learning education; Machine-learning; MOOC; Science education; Curricula",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2021) Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2021; Shapiro, B., Fiebrink, R., Norvig, P., Education: How machine learning impacts the undergraduate computing curriculum (2018) Communications of the ACM, 61 (11), pp. 27-29. , Nov; Ng, A., (2017) Deep Learning by deeplearning. ai | Coursera, , https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning, accessed Dec. 13, 2021; Perach, S., Alexandron, G., (2021) A MOOC-Based Computer Science Program for Middle School Results, Challenges, and the Covid-19 Effect, pp. 111-127; Ng, A., (2011) Machine Learning by Stanford University | Coursera, , https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning, accessed Dec. 13, 2021; Ng, A., Widom, J., (2014) Origins of the modern MOOC (xMOOC), pp. 34-47. , http://openclassroom.stanford.edu, Hrsg.

However, many ITS rely heavily on expert design and hand-crafted rules. This makes them difficult to build and transfer across domains and limits their potential efficacy. In this paper, we investigate how feedback in a large-scale ITS can be automatically generated in a data-driven way, and more specifically how personalization of feedback can lead to improvements in student performance outcomes. First, in this paper we propose a machine learning approach to generate personalized feedback in an automated way, which takes individual needs of students into account, while alleviating the need of expert intervention and design of hand-crafted rules. We leverage state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to provide students with personalized feedback using hints and Wikipedia-based explanations. Second, we demonstrate that personalized feedback leads to improved success rates at solving exercises in practice: our personalized feedback model is used in Korbit, a large-scale dialogue-based ITS with around 20,000 students launched in 2019. We present the results of experiments with students and show that the automated, data-driven, personalized feedback leads to a significant overall improvement of 22.95% in student performance outcomes and substantial improvements in the subjective evaluation of the feedback. © 2021, The Author(s).","Data science education; Deep learning; Dialogue-based tutoring systems; Intelligent tutoring systems; Natural language processing; Personalized feedback; Personalized learning","Automation; Computer aided instruction; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Students; Turing machines; Automatically generated; Intelligent tutoring system; Machine learning approaches; NAtural language processing; Personalized feedback; Potential efficacy; Student performance; Subjective evaluations; Intelligent vehicle highway systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abel, A., Chang, B.-Y.E., Pfenning, F., Human-readable machine-verifiable proofs for teaching constructive logic (2001) PTP, p. 1; Ahn, J.-W., Chang, M., Watson, P., Tejwani, R., Sundararajan, S., Abuelsaad, T., Prabhu, S., Adaptive Visual Dialog for Intelligent Tutoring Systems (2018) International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 413-418. , Springer; Albacete, P., Jordan, P., Katz, S., Chounta, I.-A., McLaren, B.M., The Impact of Student Model Updates on Contingent Scaffolding in a Natural-Language Tutoring System (2019) International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 37-47. , Springer; Aleven, V., Popescu, O., Koedinger, K.R., Towards tutorial dialog to support self-explanation: Adding natural language understanding to a cognitive tutor (2001) Proceedings of Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 246-255. , Citeseer; Anania, J., The Influence of Instructional Conditions on Student Learning and Achievement (1983) Evaluation in Education: An International Review Series, 7 (1), pp. 3-76; Anderson, J.R., Boyle, C.F., Reiser, B.J., Intelligent tutoring systems (1985) Science, 228 (4698), pp. 456-462; Andrews, P.B., Brown, C.E., Pfenning, F., Bishop, M., Issar, S., Xi, H., Etps: A system to help students write formal proofs (2004) Journal of Automated Reasoning, 32 (1), pp. 75-92; Baker, R.S., Stupid tutoring systems, intelligent humans (2016) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 26 (2), pp. 600-614; Benzmüller, C., Horacek, H., Kruijff-Korbayova, I., Pinkal, M., Siekmann, J., Wolska, M., Natural language dialog with a tutor system for mathematical proofs (2007) Cognitive Systems, pp. 1-14. , Springer; Bishop, C.M., (2006) Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, , http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/, Springer, Berlin; Bloom, B.S., The 2 sigma problem: The search for methods of group instruction as effective as one-to-one tutoring (1984) Educational researcher, 13 (6), pp. 4-16; Boaler, J., Brodie, K., The importance, nature, and impact of teacher questions (2004) Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Annual Meeting of the North American Chapter of the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education, 2, pp. 774-782; Breiman, L., Friedman, J.H., Olshen, R.A., Stone, C.J., (1984) Classification and Regression Trees, , Wadsworth and Brooks, Monterey; Breiman, L., Random Forests (2001) Machine Learning, 45 (1), pp. 5-32; Brunskill, E., Mu, T., Goel, K., Bragg, J., Automatic Curriculum Generation Applied to Teaching Novices a Short Bach Piano Segment (2018) Neurips Demonstrations; Büdenbender, J., Frischauf, A., Goguadze, G., Melis, E., Libbrecht, P., Ullrich, C., Using computer algebra systems as cognitive tools (2002) International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, pp. 802-810. , Springer; Burke, A.J., (1983) Students’ Potential for Learning Contrasted under Tutorial and Group Approaches to Instruction, , .

This paper presents a highly innovative course in a UK university that introduces undergraduate medical students to data science. It also discusses a study on student perspectives on the learning and teaching of health data science. Methods: The pedagogical design elements of the Data Science in Medicine course are discussed, along with its syllabus, assessment methodology and flipped classroom delivery. The course has been offered to approximately 630 students over three years. Student perspectives were investigated through three focus groups with the participation of 19 students across different study years in medicine. An experiment was conducted regarding instructor-led vs. video-based modalities of online programming labs, with the participation of 8 students. Results: The course has led to improved data competency among medical students and to a positive change in their opinions about data science. Motivating the course and showing relevance to clinical practice was one of the biggest challenges. Statistics was perceived by focus group participants as an essential data skill. Including data science in the medical curriculum was perceived as important by Year 1 students, while opinions varied between Year 4/5 participants. Video-based online labs were preferred over instructor-led online labs, and they were found to be more useful and enjoyable, without leading to any significant difference in academic performance. Conclusions: Teaching data science to undergraduate medicine students is highly desirable and feasible. We recommend including statistics in the curriculum and practical skill development through simple and clinically-relevant data science tasks, supported through video-based online labs. Further reporting on similar courses is needed, as well as larger-scale studies on student perspectives. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Data science; Education; Health; Health informatics; Medicine; Training","Curricula; Data Science; Laboratories; Medical education; Medicine; Students; Teaching; Focus groups; Health data; Health informatics; Learning and teachings; Medical curriculum; Medical students; Online labs; Science education; Student perspectives; Teaching practices; Medical informatics; academic achievement; adult; article; clinical practice; curriculum; data science; female; health data; human; human experiment; learning; major clinical study; male; medical informatics; medical student; skill; teaching; videorecording; medical education; medical student; university; Curriculum; Data Science; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Learning; Students, Medical; Universities",,,,,"University of Edinburgh, ED","The authors would like to thank the Usher Institute at the University of Edinburgh for funding this work through an Usher Education Development Grant.

However, the what and how of data science in pre-collegiate education have not yet reached consensus. This paper analyzes two prominent self-identified data science curricula, Introduction to Data Science (Gould et al. 2018) and Bootstrap: Data Science (Krishnamurthi et al. 2020), in order to ascertain what is thus far being presented to schools as data science. We highlight overlapping content and practices by the curricula while noting some key differences between the curricula and with professional practice. Moreover, we examine how lessons are structured and what kinds of data sets are used as well as introduce a measure of data set proximity. We conclude with some recommended areas for further coverage or elaboration in future iterations and future curricular efforts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Curriculum analysis; Data literacy; Data science education; Data science lessons; Secondary school; Statistics education",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arnold, P., Pfannkuch, M., Posing comparative statistical investigative questions (2019) Topics and trends in current statistics education research: international perspectives, pp. 173-195. , Burrill G, Ben-Zvi D, (eds), Springer International Publishing; Bakker, A., Biehler, R., Konold, C., Should young students learn about box plots?

Data science education has seen rapid growth over the past decade. To provide students with hands-on opportunities to work with real data, many data science programs have advocated for and implemented experiential learning opportunities throughout the curriculum, which has been shown in a wide variety of literature to have many benefits. Most experiential learning opportunities in STEM programs are provided through capstone and engineering design courses; this is becoming increasingly the case in data science programs as well where several universities have developed data science capstone programs in which students work with clients on the client's real-world data sets. While client-sponsored capstone projects are an exemplar of experiential learning, they may pose major challenges to implement and can be particularly resource-intensive for institutions; this is especially the case in data science where the legalities of data sharing may come with additional hurdles. Because of this, we were motivated to develop a novel client-facing data science consulting course that provides a unique experiential learning scenario to both undergraduate and graduate students while requiring much fewer resources and legalities. In our novel data science consulting course, groups of students work directly with real clients in a consulting clinic setting to provide data science guidance and short-term help with data science challenges. Through this process, students learn about the diversity of real-world problems in data science, how to lead consultations with clients effectively as a team, how to frame data science challenges and research possible solutions, and how to communicate solutions to clients in reports and presentations. We leveraged best practices in consulting courses developed in business school settings to design our course. Additionally, the consulting course serves as a community service initiative whereby researchers, clinicians, non-profit and government workers, and industry professionals benefit from the advice and short-term help provided through consultation. In this paper, we report how our consulting course is set up, how clients from both within and outside the university can seek help at the consulting clinic, and how the structure of the course enables students to have firsthand experience working on many real-world data science problems with clients. Finally, we discuss how student performance is assessed in this course, the lessons learned from offering this course, and recommendations for other data science programs in universities that wish to design similar courses. © 2022 IEEE.","consulting course; data science education; experiential learning","Data Science; Facings; Students; Capstone projects; Consulting course; Curriculum development; Data science education; Experiential learning; Innovative practices; Learning opportunity; Real-world; Science education; Science projects; Curricula",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, P., Bowring, J., McCauley, R., Pothering, G., Starr, C., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience (2014) Proceedings of the 45th ACM technical symposium on Computer science education, ser.

The use of computing software has become ubiquitous and a working knowledge of data science has become increasingly essential for researchers in all domains. However, curriculum development focusing on imparting foundational programming skills and fundamentals of data science for researchers in domains other than computing has been scarce. Thus, there is an unmet need for curriculum development involving computational thinking, programming, and the fundamentals of data science for this audience. Recognizing these growing needs and demands of researchers to learn programming and data science that can then be applied to their area of research or practice, we developed an introductory course in programming and data science for PDRs in biology and medicine. The primary goal of the course was to develop computational thinking skills in PDRs who hail from backgrounds that have traditionally not focused on inculcating computational thinking. This course covered the fundamental concepts of programming using either Python or R - languages that researchers outside the computing community use in numerous ways including the statistical analysis of large datasets that are becoming increasingly common in biomedical research. Further, PDRs enrolled in the course were introduced to some of the broad categories of problems in data science - exploratory data analysis, classification, regression, and clustering - along with relevant algorithms and how they can be applied to real-world datasets in their respective domains using packages or libraries in Python or R. We also report the feedback from the enrolled PDRs, lessons learned, and recommendations for instructors interested in designing similar curricula. Our course focusing on computing and data science education for postdoctoral scholars from a non-computing background demonstrates a promising model for incorporating computing education in other areas of study that do not traditionally have a focus on computing education as well as in continuing education. © 2022 IEEE.","computer science education; continuing education; data science education; interdisciplinary computing education","Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Curricula; Data Science; Education computing; High level languages; Precipitation (meteorology); Ubiquitous computing; Computational thinkings; Computer Science Education; Computing education; Continuing education; Curriculum development; Data science education; Interdisciplinary computing education; Introductory course; Postdoctoral researchers; Science education; Large dataset",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Provost, F., Fawcett, T., Data Science and its Relationship to Big Data and Data-Driven Decision Making (2013) Big Data, 1 (1), pp. 51-59. , https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/big.2013.1508, Mar, publisher: Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers; Franklin, D., Putting the computer science in computing education research (2015) Communications of the Acm, 58 (2), pp. 34-36. , https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2700376, Jan; (2006) Catalyzing Inquiry at the Interface of Computing and Biology, , N.

These trainings provide young people with the opportunity to learn the skills to work on Data science, with some focused specifically on women and girls. While this is encouraging and brings new opportunities for women and girls to participate in the knowledge economy, it is important to understand the wider context of data science training in Africa, in particular, how women and girls experience their (data science) education, and how this knowledge can impact their lives, sustain livelihoods and bring empowerment. Through a review of the literature, as well as an examination of different pedagogical approaches and practices used by various formal and informal training programs in Africa, we examined the experience of women and girls. We conducted a mapping of the training and networks that have been set up to provide knowledge and skills and to empower women in data science. We highlight some of the facilitators that have positively contributed to a greater participation of women and girls in data science education, while also revealing some of the barriers and structural impediments to fair access to training for women in data science. © 2022 The Author(s).

In this article, we propose a third dimension to reproducibility practices and recommend that regardless of whether they teach reproducibility in their courses or not, data science instructors adopt reproducible workflows for their own teaching.

At the same time, philosophers of science face the challenge of making their expertise accessible for scientists in such a way that it can improve everyday research practice. Here, we investigate the possibility of approaching these challenges together. In current and proposed approaches to biomedical data science education, we identify a dominant focus on only one aspect of conducting scientific research: understanding and using data, research methods, and statistical methods. We argue that this approach cannot solve biomedical data science’s challenge and we propose to shift the focus to four other aspects of conducting research: making and justifying decisions in research design and implementation, explaining their epistemic and non-epistemic effects, balancing varying responsibilities, and reporting scientific research. Attending to these aspects requires learning on different dimensions than solely learning to apply techniques (first dimension). It also requires learning to make choices (second dimension) and to understand the rationale behind choices (third dimension). This could be fostered by integrating philosophical training in biomedical data science education. Furthermore, philosophical training fosters a fourth dimension of learning, namely, understanding the nature of science. In this article, we explain how we identified the five aspects of conducting research and the four dimensions of learning, and why attending to the fourth dimension is essential. We discuss educational approaches to attend to all aspects and dimensions, and present initial design principles to implement these approaches. © 2022, The Author(s).",,,,,,,"Universiteit Utrecht, UU","This study was funded by Utrecht University.",,,,,,,,,,"Nature of science in science education: Toward a coherent framework for synergistic research and development (2012) Second International Handbook of Science Education (, pp. 1041-1060. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-9041-7_69, In B.

New data science education programs, which are being launched at an increasing rate, are designed for multiple education levels and populations. Machine learning (ML) is an essential element of data science that requires an extensive background in mathematics. Whereas it is possible to teach the principles of ML only as a black box, novice learners might find it difficult to improve an algorithm’s performance without a white box understanding of the underlying ML algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a pedagogical method, based on hands-on pen-and-paper tasks, to support white box understanding of ML algorithms for learners who lack the level of mathematics knowledge required for this purpose. Data were collected using a comprehension questionnaire and analyzed according to the process-object theory borrowed from mathematics education research. We present evidence of the effectiveness of this method based on data collected in an introduction-level data science course for graduate psychology students. This population had extensive psychology domain knowledge, as well as an established background in statistics, but had gaps in mathematical and computer science knowledge compared with data science majors. The research contribution is both practical and theoretical. Practically, we present a learning module that supports non-major data science students’ white box understanding of ML. Theoretically, we propose a data analysis method to evaluate students’ conceptions of ML algorithms. © 2022","Data science education; Machine learning; Process-object duality theory; Statistics education research",,,,,,"Tel Aviv University, ТАУ; Technion-Israel Institute of Technology","This work was supported by generous funding from the Technion’s Machine Learning & Intelligent Systems (MLIS) Center.

A new interdisciplinary data science course aims to merge STEM and humanities perspectives starting at the very beginning of the data science curriculum. Existing literature suggests that humanities integration can make STEM courses more appealing to a wider range of students, including women and students of color, and enhance student learning of essential concepts and foundational reasoning skills, such as those collectively known as data acumen. Cultivating students’ data acumen requires a more inclusive vision of how the knowledge and insights generated through computational methods and statistical analysis relates to other ways of knowing. © 2022","Data acumen; Data literacy; Data science education research; Humanities education research; Statistical literacy; Statistics education research",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 2044384","We thank the anonymous reviewers for insightful comments and suggestions to improve this paper.

To date, the research on the IDS course has primarily focused on pedagogy, professional learning for teachers, and the curriculum. This mixed-methods case study expands our understanding by analyzing the perspective of IDS students at a California public high school. Selfdetermination theory provides a useful frame for interpreting how these students experience the IDS course. The theory focuses on conditions for students to engage in meaningful learning: competence (self-efficacy), autonomy (agency), and relatedness (a sense of belonging). The findings from this case study suggest the IDS students feel confident, empowered, and part of a vibrant community, unlike previous mathematics and statistics courses they may have completed; and use specific language to describe their joy in problem-solving and the accessibility of the course. These findings have implications for the development and refinement of any high school data science course, including IDS. © 2022","Data science education; High school mathematics pathways; Non-traditional high school mathematics; Statistics education research",,,,,,,"I wish to thank Ms. Arcega and her IDS students for participating in the research study.

As the discipline of statistics education broadens to data science education, there is a need to examine how practices in data science can inform work in K–12. To better understand how to frame data science practices in K–12, we synthesize literature about statistics investigation processes, data science as a field, and practices of data scientists. Further, we provide results from a phenomenological study of the work of data scientists. Together, these inform a new framework to support data investigation processes. We explicate the practices and dispositions needed and offer a glimpse of how the framework can be used to move data science education forward. © 2022","Data investigation framework; Data science education; Industry ethnography; Literature review; Statistics education research",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: DRL 1908760; North Carolina State University, NCSU","The research reported here was partially supported by the RTI University Scholars Program and funding from the National Science Foundation (DRL 1908760) awarded to North Carolina State University.

As such it spends less emphasis on coding, computing, and high-end black-box algorithms.

Minimal research, however, exists about the design of tasks that support the introduction of high school students and teachers to these new statistical and computational methods. Using a designbased research approach, a web-based task was developed. The task was constructed using our design framework and implemented within a face-to-face professional development workshop involving six high school statistics teachers. The teachers were guided through the process of developing a prediction model using: an informal approach; visual prediction intervals; data about movie ratings from an API; and R code that ran in the browser. Our findings from this exploratory study indicate that the web-based task supported the development of new statistical and computational ideas related to predictive modelling and APIs. © 2022","APIs; Data science education; High school teachers; Integrating statistical and computational thinking; Predictive modelling; Task design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allaire, J., Xie, Y., McPherson, J., Luraschi, J., Ushey, K., Atkins, A., Wickham, H., Iannone, R., (2021) rmarkdown: Dynamic documents for R.

Achieving critical and just data literacies is especially challenging in an ideologically polarizing “post-truth” world in which we confront a rising tide of misinformation and fake news, alongside discourse that denigrates politically conservative perspectives. Although reasoning with data is rooted in epistemic processes, the stances people take are-and should be-influenced by values, concerns about maintaining cultural group membership, and concerns about equity and justice. Through a range of approaches, contexts, and age groups, the papers seek to illuminate how to help learners become adept at employing data interpretation conventions, scrutinizing the reliability of data representations, and examining whether data representations render humans and more-than-humans visible or invisible, central, peripheral, unidimensional, or complex. Jointly, the papers examine how to cultivate publics who make use of consequential data representations to negotiate their everyday lives, and who identify and resist datafied injustice. © ISLS.","axiology; data literacies; data science education; epistemology; justice; post-truth","Axiology; Cultural groups; Data literacy; Data representations; Data science education; Epistemology; Group memberships; Justice; Post-truth; Science education",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arastoopour Irgens, G., Knight, S., Wise, A.

Since the 1990s, Indian software firms have developed expertise in carrying out outsourced back-office tasks and mid-level IT services like data entry, managing call centres, and performing software quality testing for foreign companies taking advantage of a technically trained local workforce. The trend of automating manual work practices in the IT industry has generated a different kind of demand for data sciences directed at upskilling and job readiness. India is witnessing a market-oriented groundswell of data science and IT skill tutoring ‘shops’, resituating science and engineering education. In this chapter we report from ethnographic research conducted in two IT skill training parks to underpin arguments about emerging neo-educational learning structures suited to a data science education for new livelihood opportunities in an IT-accredited India. Our chapter makes a case for looking at ‘data studies’ from an ethnographic perspective uncovering a ‘program’ of upward mobility through IT skilling and employment. What directions might data studies about tutoring data science skills in the Indian context lead to? Excerpts presented here from field research imagine new livelihoods, aspirations, and technology skills that are more often than not a reflection of the power of data science education. © 2022, The Author(s).","Data science education; Employment; India; IT industry; IT Skills",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: RES-063-27-0089","1This research was funded by ESRC early career fellowship awarded to HN (Grant number—RES-063-27-0089).",,,,,,,,,,"Akerlof, G.A., The market for lemons: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism (1970) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84 (3), pp. 488-500; All India Survey of Higher Education Report.

The primary goal of this work is to provide an intelligent solution to automatically identify biases related to race and gender in the content of Data Science related courses such as Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Mining, Data Analytics, and Knowledge Discovery just to name a few. While machine learning allows to build powerful predicting tools, it hasn't been used sufficiently to detect biases rooted in gender and race in educational material. Hence, using effective machine learning techniques we aim to enhance the success rate of undergraduate students in Data Science education and programs while promoting engagement through identifying and mitigating potential gender and racial biases. To this end, we propose a novel bias detection approach which uses a combination of gender identification and sentiment classification for characterization of gender and race in educational contents. Our proposed framework can help educators and course developers to mitigate race and gender biases in their course materials and create an equitable learning experience for students of minority and under-represented groups. © 2022 IEEE.","Data Science; Education; Gender and Racial Equity; Machine Learning","Curricula; Data Analytics; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Students; Data analytics; Educational materials; Equal opportunity; Gender and racial equity; Gender bias; Growing demand; Intelligent solutions; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Undergraduate degrees; Data Science",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tsvetkov, Y., Field, A., (2020) Unsupervised Discovery of Implicit Gender Bias, , Cornell University; Barker, M., Inception v3 deep convolutional architecture for classifying acute myeloid/lymphoblastic leukemia (2019) Intel.

In this article, we reflect on JSDSE’s relevance to K-12 education and how it might increase its influence in this area. We characterize JSDSE’s K-12 impact partially in terms of its ability to foster statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT). We also introduce a new construct, statistical knowledge for the transformation of teaching (SKT (Formula presented.), to more fully capture the K-12 contributions JSDSE can make. Our analysis draws upon the perspectives of an experienced high school teacher (the first author) and a statistics education researcher (the second author). The first author of the article surveyed recent JSDSE issues to identify and reflect upon articles with implications for his teaching practice. The second author framed the first author’s article reflections in terms of their connections to SKT and SKT2. Drawing upon our collaborative analysis, we propose strategies to help JSDSE more fully realize its potential to contribute to SKT and SKT2. We explain how acting on the proposed strategies may help JSDSE readers, authors, and editors bridge the persistent historical gap between formal scholarship and practice in K-12 education. © 2022 The Author(s).

In this paper, we shall report strategy and development of the DS curriculum standards. Data science education and the development of data scientists are recognised to be quite important in both social and business contexts. The IPSJ DS curriculum standard is developed by integrating various related initiatives and has the following unique features. (1) The DS curriculum standard covers a wide range of related fields to ensure international compatibility through mapping to the ACM Data Science curriculum and the European EDISON Data Science Framework. (2) It collaborates with the IPSJ Data Scientist certification (under development) by referring to the Data Scientist skill checklist (assistant level) developed by the Data Scientist Society of Japan. (3) It clarifies the knowledge and skills required of students majoring in data science. (4) It assigns a time to each educational content so that the curriculum size becomes approximately 675 class hours (60 credits in the Japanese credit system). (5) It collaborates with the Model Curriculum for Mathematics, Data Science and AI Education (literacy level) developed by the Japan Inter-University Consortium for Mathematics and Data Science, supported by the Japanese government. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Curriculum development; Data management; Data science; Data scientist certification; Software engineering; Statistics","Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Data Science; Education computing; Software engineering; Students; Business contexts; Curriculum development; Curriculum standards; Data scientist certification; Educational contents; Science curriculum; Science education; Social context; Unique features; University levels; Information management",,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN: 20K03232; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT","This research is supported by JSPS Kakenhi #20K03232.","IPSJ has developed curriculum standards for computing education at the university level for nearly 30 years and has promoted a variety of activities related to computing education at the primary, secondary, high school, and university levels.

In this article, we assert that these discussions of teaching and learning must attend to the human dimensions of data work. Specifically, we draw from several established lines of research to argue that practices involving the creation and manipulation of data are shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural tools and practices, and political concerns. We demonstrate through two examples how our proposed humanistic stance highlights ways that efforts to make data personally relevant for youth also necessarily implicate cultural and sociopolitical dimensions that affect the design and learning opportunities in data-rich learning environments. We offer an interdisciplinary framework based on literature from multiple bodies of educational research to inform design, teaching and research for more effective, responsible, and inclusive student learning experiences with and about data. © 2021 The Author(s).","case studies; computers and learning; curriculum; data literacy; data science; mathematics education; science education; technology",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; Center for Selective C-H Functionalization, National Science Foundation; Center for Hierarchical Manufacturing, National Science Foundation, CHM, NSF; National Science Foundation, United Arab Emirates, NRF; National Science Foundation of Sri Lanka, NSF: 1054280, 1541676, 1900606",,,,,,,,,,,"Arnold, P., What about the P in the PPDAC cycle?

What does the end-to-end workflow of a data scientist's collaboration with clients look like throughout the lifetime of a project? To investigate this question, we interviewed ten data scientists (5 female, 4 male, 1 non-binary) in diverse roles across industry and academia. We discovered that they work with clients in a six-stage outer-loop workflow, which involves 1) laying groundwork by building trust before a project begins, 2) orienting to the constraints of the client's environment, 3) collaboratively framing the problem, 4) bridging the gap between data science and domain expertise, 5) the inner loop of technical data analysis work, 6) counseling to help clients emotionally cope with analysis results. This novel outer-loop workflow contributes to CSCW by expanding the notion of what collaboration means in data science beyond the widely-known inner-loop technical workflow stages of acquiring, cleaning, analyzing, modeling, and visualizing data. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for data science education, parallels to design work, and unmet needs for tool development. © 2021 Owner/Author.","collaborative work; data science; interview study","Client needs; Collaborative Work; Domain expertise; End to end; Inner loops; Interview study; Non-binary; Outer loop; Six stages; Work-flows; Data Science",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: IIS-1845900; Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, CISE: 1845900","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. NSF IIS-1845900.",,,,,,,,,,"Alspaugh, S., Zokaei, N., Liu, A., Jin, C., Hearst, M.A., Futzing and moseying: Interviews with professional data analysts on exploration practices (2019) IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 25 (1), pp. 22-31. , https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865040, Jan. 2019; Ball, A., Review of Data Management Lifecycle Models, , [n. d. ]; Kaj Blomkvist, J., Persson, J., Åberg, J., Communication through boundary objects in distributed agile teams (2015) Association for Computing Machinery, pp. 1875-1884. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2702123.2702366, New York, NY, USA; Bross, I.D.J., The role of the statistician: Scientist or shoe clerk (1974) The American Statistician, 28 (4), pp. 126-127. , https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.1974.10479092; Choi, J., Tausczik, Y., Characteristics of collaboration in the emerging practice of open data analysis (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, pp. 835-846. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2998181.2998265, (Portland, Oregon, USA) (CSCW '17).

In invoking exponential growth, mathematical modelling, statistical analysis, and the like, these data visualizations invite opportunities for mathematics teaching and learning. Yet data visualizations are social texts, authored from specific points of view, that narrate particular, and often consequential, stories. Their fundamental reliance on quantification and mathematics cements their social positioning as supposedly objective, reliable, and neutral. The reading of any data visualization demands unpacking the role of mathematics, including how data and variables have been formatted and how relationships are framed to narrate stories from particular points of view. We present an approach to a critical reading of data visualizations for the context of mathematics education that draws on three interrelated concepts: mathematical formatting (what gets quantified, measured, and how), framing (how variables are related and through what kind of data visualization), and narrating (which stories the data visualization tells, its potential impacts and limits). This approach to reading data visualisations includes a process of reimagining through reformatting, reframing and renarrating. We illustrate this approach and these three concepts using data visualizations published in the New York Times in 2020 about COVID-19.

Initial work in a quasi-experimental setting suggests that explicitly designing for experiences of failure leads to better learning outcomes than designing for success. We build on this to report on a controlled experimental study where students are exposed to failure-driven, success-driven, or no explicit scaffolding in problem-solving prior to instruction. For assessments of non-isomorphic conceptual understanding, our results align with those from prior work. Despite the similarity in posttest scores, students exposed to failure-driven scaffolding demonstrate higher quality of constructive reasoning than those receiving success-driven scaffolding. Additionally, our study reveals learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding (for both posttest scores and reasoning quality) on assessments of transfer. Several cognitive, affective and meta-cognitive mechanisms are investigated to explain robust learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding in preparatory problem-solving. © 2021 The Author(s)","Data science education; Failure; Higher education; Problem-based learning; Scaffolding",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ackerman, R., Thompson, V.A., Meta-Reasoning: Monitoring and control of thinking and reasoning (2017) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 21 (8), pp. 607-617; Aleven, V., Connolly, H., Popescu, O., Marks, J., Lamnina, M., Chase, C., An adaptive coach for invention activities (2017) International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 3-14; Aleven, V., McLaughlin, E.A., Glenn, R.A., Koedinger, K.R., Instruction based on adaptive learning technologies (2016) Handbook of Research on Learning And Instruction, pp. 522-560; Aleven, V., Stahl, E., Schworm, S., Fischer, F., Wallace, R., Help seeking and help design in interactive learning environments (2003) Review of Educational Research, 73 (3), pp. 277-320; Bjork, R.A., Dunlosky, J., Kornell, N., Self-regulated learning: Beliefs, techniques, and illusions (2013) Annual Review of Psychology, 64, pp. 417-444; Brand, S., Reimer, T., Opwis, K., How do we learn in a negative mood?

The integration of data science can provide a more equitable mathematics pipeline than the calculus-focused pathway that has excluded most students from a future in mathematics. Through data science, students can learn to answer questions that are relevant to their lives and communities, to be critical consumers of the data that surround them every day, and to wield the power of data analysis. © 2021 by Phi Delta Kappa International.","curriculum; data literacy; data science; data science education; equity; mathematics pathways",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., Data scientists are growing faster than demand, is it true?

This program was built to support a set of introductory skills-based, higher education courses. We are motivated by work done in project-based learning contexts and culturally responsive pedagogies and are particularly keen to understand how we can scale such kinds of approaches to large and diverse global classrooms. Specifically, we consider the country from which a learner is accessing the course as the key context for our work and discuss two interrelated investigations we have undertaken to understand how this feature interacts with learners’ motivation and learning. Our findings provide insights on how learners respond to location-specific problem-based personalizations in data science education and provides an initial exploration as to how this form of personalization differs depending on the geo-political context of the learners. © 2021, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.","Culturally relevant pedagogy; Data science education; Learning at scale; Personalization","Artificial intelligence; Initial exploration; Large scale data; Political context; Project based learning; Science education; Science learning; Science programs; Specific problems; Data Science",,,,,,"The authors gratefully acknowledge Filip Jankovic for his support in the first study, Joseph Jay Williams for his comments and insights on the second study, and Yuanru Tan who provided editorial assistance and graphic design work for the manuscript.

Currently significant progress has been made in classwork, while progress in hands-on research experience is still lacking. To help fill this gap, we propose to create data-enabled engineering project (DEEP) modules in the form of interactive Jupyter Notebooks based on real data and applications. We hypothesize that this web-based interactive development and learning environment (IDLE) will enable easy and wide adoption of the DEEP modules by other educators and institutions.

Redd Associate Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Auburn University. She obtained her BS and PhD degrees in chemical engineering (specialized in biochemical engineering) from Tsinghua University in 1994, and 1999 respectively. She then obtained a PhD degree (specialized in control engineering) from the University of Texas at Austin in 2004. From 2002 to 2006 she was a development engineer and senior development engineer at Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. During her tenure at AMD, her R&D yielded 13 patents granted by USPTO. In addition, she received several prestigious corporate awards for being instrumental in developing effective advanced control solutions. Dr. Wang joined Auburn University in 2006 as B. Redd Assistant Professor. She was promoted to Associate Professor and granted tenure in 2011. The central theme of her current research is to apply systems engineering, in particular, control engineering principles and techniques to understand, predict and control complex dynamic systems which cover both industrial processes and microbial organisms. Currently, she has extended her research focus to metabolic network modeling and analysis, as well as related experimentations. The system identification based framework for metabolic network analysis has been proving to be a highly effective tool to extract biological knowledge from complex, genome-scale metabolic network models, and has been successfully applied to understanding several industrial relevant microbes. She was the 2008 recipient of the Ralph E. Powe Junior Faculty Enhancement Awards from Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU). Her graduate student also won the inaugural AIChE CAST Director’s Presentation Award in 2011. Her research is funded by various US federal and state funding agencies including NSF, USDA, Department of Education and DOT as well as private foundations. She has over 40 journal publications, plus additional conference proceedings (&gt;40) and presentations (&gt;70).

We discuss a proposal for the stealth development of computational skills in students' exposure to introductory data science through careful, scaffolded exposure to computation and its power. Our intent is to support students, regardless of interest and self-efficacy in coding, in becoming data-driven learners, who are capable of asking complex questions about the world around them, and then answering those questions through the use of data-driven inquiry.

This context is familiar to students and provides a link between school and everyday experience. In this module, they use CODAP's “Arbor” plug-in to manually build decision trees and understand how to systematically build trees based on data. Further on, the students use a menu-based environment in a Jupyter Notebook to apply an algorithm that automatically generates decision trees and to evaluate and optimize the performance of these. Students acquire technical and conceptual skills but also reflect on personal and social aspects of the uses of algorithms from machine learning. © 2021 The Authors.

To address those challenges in scaling up the assessment of DS group projects, we integrated multiple techniques, such as rapid feedback, peer grading, graders as meta-reviewers, etc. We present a case study of deploying those strategies for group projects in a large online DS course titled Text Information Systems offered in Fall, 2020.

Data science is a new and interdisciplinary STEM-oriented domain, integrating knowledge and skills from computer science, mathematics, and statistics with an application domain, from which the data draw their context and meaning. Data science applications are relevant for various domains, and therefore, a variety of populations are increasingly attracted to learning it. Addressing the theme of the conference, i.e., 'Women in Engineering', in this paper we describe a data science workshop for social sciences and digital humanities researchers. A significant majority (83%) of the participants of this workshop self-identified as women. This gender proportion, the opposite of that prevailing in STEM studies, led us to examine the workshop from a gender perspective. Our results indicate that the women participating in the data science workshop perceived it as an opportunity to acquire research tools rather than programming tools. We suggest that framing the workshop as a research tool workshop and not as a programming workshop reduced prevalent gender barriers in STEM, encouraging a majority of women researchers to participate. In this paper, we elaborate on the participants' perceptions about data science and programming and analyze them based on three theoretical perspectives: expectancy value theory, the interdisciplinary perspective, and the epistemological perspective. © 2021 IEEE.","Data science; Data science education; Gender balance; Interdisciplinary of data science","Engineering education; Population statistics; Professional aspects; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Digital humanities; Expectancy-value theory; Oriented domains; Programming tools; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Science applications; Science workshops; Women in engineering; Data Science",,,,,,"This research is conducted with the generous support of The Bernard M.

Data Science is becoming a new recognised field of science that leverages the Data Analytics methods with the power of the Big Data technologies and Cloud Computing that both provide a basis for effective use of the data driven research and economy models. Data Science research and education require a multi-disciplinary approach and data driven/centric paradigm shift. Besides core professional competences and knowledge in Data Science, increasing digitalisation of Science and Industry also requires new type of workplace and professional skills that rise the importance of critical thinking, problem solving and creativity required to work in highly automated and dynamic environment. The education and training of the data related professions must reflect all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science and handling practitioners in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple forms, also providing sufficient lab facilities for practical training. This paper discusses aspects of building customizable and interoperable Data Science curricula for different types of learners and target application domains.

Our work presents a first step in this direction, by leveraging the coding metrics from traditional software engineering (Halstead Volume and Cyclomatic Complexity) in combination with those that reflect a data science project's learning objectives (number of library calls and number of common library calls with the solution code). Through these metrics, we examined the code submissions of 97 students across two semesters of an introductory data science course. Our results indicated that the metrics can identify cases where students had overly complicated codes and would benefit from scaffolding feedback. The number of library calls, in particular, was also a significant predictor of changes in submission score and submission runtime, which highlights the distinctive nature of data science programming. We conclude with suggestions for extending our analyses towards more actionable intervention strategies, for example by tracking the fine-grained submission grading outputs throughout a student's submission history, to better model and support them in their data science learning process. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Coding metrics;

The effort is led by members of a joint data science criteria subcommittee appointed by ABET's Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) and CSAB (the lead society for computing accreditation). Establishing data science accreditation criteria is a notable milestone in the maturing data science discipline, indicating the presence of an accepted body of knowledge, standards of practice, and ethical codes for practitioners. This position paper motivates the effort and discusses prior work towards defining data science education requirements. It describes the ongoing process for creating and obtaining approval of the accreditation criteria, and how feedback was and will be solicited from the computing and statistical communities. The current draft data science criteria, which was approved in July 2020 by the relevant ABET bodies for a year of public review and comment, is presented. These criteria emphasize the three pillars of data science: Computing foundations, mathematical/statistical foundations, and experience in at least one data application domain. This report thus serves both to inform and to stimulate the academic discussion needed to finalize appropriate data science accreditation by ABET. © 2021 ACM.","computing education; data analytics programs; data science programs; program accreditation","Accreditation; Education computing; Abet accreditation criterion; Accreditation criteria; Body of knowledge; Computing Accreditation Commission; Data application; Science disciplines; Science education; Science programs; Data Science",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1433736, 1922169, 2021287","Our thanks are due to Lillian (Boots) Cassel, Hridesh Rajan, Barbara Price, and Heikki Topi, who served on the Data Science Criteria Subcommittee and helped to develop the Data Science Criteria proposal drafts.

An integral part of many degree programs is a capstone experience, where students complete a major research or real-world project at the culmination of their educational program. In engineering and computer science, many have shown that client-sponsored projects lead to better student engagement and improved training. In this paper, we discuss experiences with developing an interdisciplinary, client-sponsored capstone program in data science and machine learning. We show how we set up the capstone program, including how the program is structured, how projects are set up, how the course is managed, how students are assessed, and outline the newly developed capstone curriculum. Finally, we report results from a cohort of students participating in this capstone program and discuss lessons learned as well as best practices when developing data science capstone programs. © 2021 ACM.","capstone; client-sponsored projects; data science; experiential learning; machine learning; team-based projects","Data Science; Education computing; Engineering education; Capstone experience; Capstone program; Educational program; Engineering and computer science; Experiential learning; Real world projects; Science education; Student engagement; Students",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: DMS-1554821","The authors acknowledge support from NSF DMS-1554821.",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, L., Daniels, M., Goold, A., Hazzan, O., Lynch, K., Newman, I., Challenges in teaching capstone courses (2003) Acm Sigcse Bulletin, 35 (3), pp. 219-220. , 2003; Anderson, P., Bowring, J., McCauley, R., Pothering, G., Starr, C., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience (2014) Proceedings of the 45th Acm Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 145-150; Bacon, D.R., Stewart, K.A., Silver, W.S., Lessons from the best and worst student team experiences: How a teacher can make the difference (1999) Journal of Management Education, 23 (5), pp. 467-488. , 1999; Baxter, M., Byun, B., Coyle, E.J., Dang, T., Dwyer, T., Kim, I., Lee, C.-H., Sephus, N., On projectbased learning through the vertically-integrated projects program (2011) 2011 Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), , IEEE, T1F-1; Beier, M.E., Kim, M.H., Saterbak, A., Leautaud, V., Bishnoi, S., Gilberto, J.M., The effect of authentic project-based learning on attitudes and career aspirations in stem (2019) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 56 (1), pp. 3-23. , 2019; Bishop, J.L., Verleger, M.A., The flipped classroom: A survey of the research (2013) Asee National Conference Proceedings, 30, pp. 1-18. , Atlanta, GA; Brutus, S., Donia, M.B.L., Improving the effectiveness of students in groups with a centralized peer evaluation system (2010) Academy of Management Learning & Education, 9 (4), pp. 652-662. , 2010; Chamillard, A.T., Braun, K.A., The software engineering capstone: Structure and tradeoffs (2002) Proceedings of the 33rd Sigcse Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 227-231; Rios, I.D.L., Cazorla, A., Diáz-Puente, J.M., Yaguë, J.L., Project-based learning in engineering higher education: Two decades of teaching competences in real environments (2010) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 2 (2), pp. 1368-1378. , 2010; Veaux, R.D.D., Agarwal, M., Averett, M., Baumer, B.S., Bray, A., Bressoud, T.C., Bryant, L., Gould, R., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science (2017) Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 15-30. , 2017; Dutson, A.J., Todd, R.H., Magleby, S.P., Sorensen, C.D., A review of literature on teaching engineering design through project-oriented capstone courses (1997) Journal of Engineering Education, 86 (1), pp. 17-28. , 1997; Gorka, S., Miller, J.R., Howe, B.J., Developing realistic capstone projects in conjunction with industry (2007) Proceedings of the 8th Acm Sigite Conference on Information Technology Education, pp. 27-32; Hadim, H.A., Esche, S.K., Enhancing the engineering curriculum through project-based learning (2002) 32nd Annual Frontiers in Education, 2, pp. F3F-F3F; Hardin, J., Hoerl, R., Horton, N.J., Nolan, D., Baumer, B., Hall-Holt, O., Murrell, P., Lang, D.T., Data science in statistics curricula: Preparing students to ""think with data"" (2015) The American Statistician, 69 (4), pp. 343-353. , 2015; Jones, B.D., Epler, C.M., Mokri, P., Bryant, L.H., Paretti, M.C., The effects of a collaborative problem-based learning experience on students' motivation in engineering capstone courses (2013) Interdisciplinary Journal of Problem-based Learning, 7 (2), p. 2. , 2013; Judith, W.C., Bair, B., Börstler, J., Lethbridge, T.C., Surendran, K., Client sponsored projects in software engineering courses (2003) Proceedings of the 34th Sigcse Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 401-402; Kolb, A.Y., Kolb, D.A., Learning styles and learning spaces: Enhancing experiential learning in higher education (2005) Academy of Management Learning & Education, 4 (2), pp. 193-212. , 2005; Kolb, D.A., (2014) Experiential Learning: Experience As the Source of Learning and Development, , FT press; Loughry, M.L., Ohland, M.W., Woehr, D.J., Assessing teamwork skills for assurance of learning using CATME team tools (2014) Journal of Marketing Education, 36 (1), pp. 5-19. , 2014; Miller, R.L., Olds, B.M., A model curriculum for a capstone course in multidisciplinary engineering design (1994) Journal of Engineering Education, 83 (4), pp. 311-316. , 1994; (2018) Data Science for Undergraduates: Opportunities and Options, , Engineering National Academies of Sciences, Medicine, et al.

As an emerging interdisciplinary study field, data science curriculum is typically a collection of individual data science related courses from different schools and departments, most of which are teaching data science in a siloed fashion. Therefore, it is necessary to map the landscape of existing curricula and explore how academic libraries can collaborate and contribute to undergraduate data science education. In this study, we analyzed teaching content and topics of over 100 data science related courses at Purdue University to map the landscape and explore roles of academic libraries to support data science education curriculum. Our results indicate most existing courses focused on ‘hard-core’ scientific analytic principles, such as computer science, statistics, and domain-specific skills. Courses of data-oriented skills, such as data management, data ethics, and data communications were limited across disciplines. In addition, data science courses were more likely targeting STEM students at upper levels (3rd and 4th year students). Academic libraries can enrich data science education efforts, by supporting credit courses, certificate programs, and other co-curricular activities to provide learning opportunities to all students, particularly 1st and 2nd year students and non-STEM majors. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","College; Curriculum; Data ethics; Data management; Data science; Education; Libraries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aasheim, C.L., Williams, S., Rutner, P., Gardiner, A., Data analytics vs. data science: A study of similarities and differences in undergraduate programs based on course descriptions (2015) Journal of Information Systems Education, 26 (2), p. 103; Adams, J.C., Creating a balanced data science program (2020) Proceedings of the 51st ACM technical symposium on computer science education, pp. 185-191; Amstatenews, New undergraduate data science programs (2015), https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2015/07/01/new-undergraduate-data-science-programs/, Retrieved Dec 15. 2020, from; Anderson, P., Bowring, J., McCauley, R., Pothering, G., Starr, C., (2014, March).

This has shifted major challenges in biological research from data generation and processing to interpretation and knowledge translation. However, postsecondary training in bioinformatics, or more generally data science for life scientists, lags behind current demand. In particular, development of accessible, undergraduate data science curricula has the potential to improve research and learning outcomes as well as better prepare students in the life sciences to thrive in public and private sector careers. Here, we describe the Experiential Data science for Undergraduate Cross-Disciplinary Education (EDUCE) initiative, which aims to progressively build data science competency across several years of integrated practice. Through EDUCE, students complete data science modules integrated into required and elective courses augmented with coordinated cocurricular activities. The EDUCE initiative draws on a community of practice consisting of teaching assistants (TAs), postdocs, instructors, and research faculty from multiple disciplines to overcome several reported barriers to data science for life scientists, including instructor capacity, student prior knowledge, and relevance to discipline-specific problems.

Organizations that pursue data intelligence consider Data Science professionals immensely relevant. However, universities and higher education institutions are starting to offer undergraduate programs and courses for Data Science education. In this sense, EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) is presented as a relevant framework to further the education of Data Science Professionals. Thus, this article addresses the integration of EDSF with ADDIE Model, an instructional design model, capable of enabling the construction of an Instructional System (IS). Based on the Learning Outcomes (LO) of the EDSF Model Curriculum Data Science (MC-DS), the article proposes an integrated approach of these LOs along with the phases of ADDIE Model supporting the construction of a Data Science Instructional System (DSIS).

Tim Brown, president, and CEO of IDEO, defines design thinking as “A human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success”. The application of design thinking has been witnessed to be the road to develop innovative applications, interactive systems, scientific software, healthcare application, and even to utilize Design Thinking to re-think business operation as the case of Airbnb. Recently, there has been a movement to apply design thinking to machine learning and artificial intelligence to ensure creating the “waw” affect to consumers. ACM Taskforce on Data Science program states that “Data Scientists should be able to implement and understand algorithms for data collection and analysis. They should understand the time and space considerations of algorithms. They should follow good design principles developing software, understanding the importance of those principles for testability and maintainability” However, this definition hides the user behind the machine who works on data preparation, algorithm selection and model interpretation.

Yet it can be a challenge to fit the teaching of such skills into the data science curriculum. Team-Based Learning (TBL) is a pedagogical strategy that can help educators teach data science better by flipping the classroom to employ small-group collaborative learning to actively engage students in doing data science. A consequence of this teaching method is helping students achieve the workforce-relevant data science learning goals of effective communication, teamwork, and collaboration. We describe the essential elements of TBL: accountability structures and feedback mechanisms to support students collaborating within permanent teams on well-designed application exercises to do data science. The results of our case study of using TBL to teach a modern, introductory data science course indicate that the course effectively taught reproducible data science workflows, beginning R programming, and communication and collaboration. Students also reported much room for improvement in their learning of statistical thinking and advanced R concepts. To help the data science education community adopt this appealing pedagogical strategy, we outline steps for deciding on using TBL, preparing and planning for it, and overcoming potential pitfalls when using TBL to teach data science. © 2021 The Author(s).

Here we describe the development and performance of a computing platform developed to support a series of MOOCs in clinical data science. This platform was designed to restrict and log all access to health datasets while also being scalable, accessible, secure, privacy preserving, and easy to access.

The model of the quantified self—in which data about one’s own activities are collected and made into objects of study—provides inspiration for one such approach. By drawing on what one already knows about their self and their prior experiences, it may be possible to bootstrap students’ abilities to interpret and make sense of data. Taking that possibility seriously, this article describes some of the gains observed in students’ statistical reasoning following a quantified self, wearables-based elementary statistics unit and provides a theoretical framework drawing from cognitive psychology, embodiment, and situative perspectives to characterize how prior experience is used as a resource in data sense-making when the data are about students’ own physical experiences. This framework centralizes and interrogates the work of “remembering” prior experiences and articulates how remembering is involved in interpreting quantified self data. Specifically, the framework emphasizes that remembering in service of data interpretation is a reconstructive act that draws from both general and specific embodied resources and that the work of reconstructive remembering in the classroom is both individual and multi-participant work. To demonstrate measured learning gains and illustrate the framework, written assessment results and descriptive cases of student and teacher discussions about quantified self data from two sixth-grade classes participating in a classroom design experiment are provided. Both a discussion of and recommendations for ethical considerations related to quantified self data in education are also provided. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: DRL-1054280","This work was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation (US) under Grant No. DRL-1054280.

In the intervening decade, the statistics education community has acknowledged that computational skills are as important to statistics and data science practice as mathematics. There remains a notable gap, however, between our intentions and our actions. In this special issue of the Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, we have assembled a collection of articles that (1) suggest creative structures to integrate computing, (2) describe novel data science skills and habits, and (3) propose ways to teach computational thinking. We believe that it is critical for the community to redouble our efforts to embrace sophisticated computing in the statistics and data science curriculum. We hope that these articles provide useful guidance for the community to move these efforts forward. © 2021 The Author(s).

In the time since, individuals with training in both computing and statistics have become increasingly employable in the burgeoning data science field. In response, universities have developed new courses and programs to meet the growing demand for data science education. To address this demand, we created Data Science in Practice, a large-enrollment undergraduate course. Here, we present our goals for teaching this course, including: (1) conceptualizing data science as creative problem solving, with a focus on project-based learning, (2) prioritizing practical application, teaching and using standardized tools and best practices, and (3) scaling education through coursework that enables hands-on and classroom learning in a large-enrollment course. Throughout this course we also emphasize social context and data ethics to best prepare students for the interdisciplinary and impactful nature of their work. We highlight creative problem solving and strategies for teaching automation-resilient skills, while providing students the opportunity to create a unique data science project that demonstrates their technical and creative capacities. © 2021 The Author(s).

Through analyzing the hosting departments, design principles, curriculum objectives, and curriculum design of existing programs, our findings reveal that (1) the data science field is inherently interdisciplinary and requires joint collaborations between various departments. Multi-department administration was one of the solutions to offer interdisciplinary training, but some problems have also been identified in its practical implementation; (2) data science education should emphasize hands-on practice and experiential learning opportunities to prepare students for data analysis and problem-solving in real-world contexts; and (3) although the importance of comprehensive coverage of various disciplines in data science curricula is widely acknowledged, how to achieve an effective balance between various disciplines and how to effectively integrate domain knowledge into the curriculum still remain open questions.

This emergence also extends to undergraduate education, whereby a growing number of institutions now offer degree programs in data science. However, there is considerable variation in what the field actually entails and, by extension, differences in how undergraduate programs prepare students for data-intensive careers. We used two seminal frameworks for data science education to evaluate undergraduate data science programs at a subset of 4-year institutions in the United States; developing and applying a rubric, we assessed how well each program met the guidelines of each of the frameworks. Most programs scored high in statistics and computer science and low in domain-specific education,ethics, and areas of communication. Moreover, the academic unit administering the degree program significantly influenced the course-load distribution of computer science and statistics/mathematics courses. We conclude that current data science undergraduate programs provide solid grounding in computational and statistical approaches, yet may not deliver sufficient context in terms of domain knowledge and ethical considerations necessary for appropriate data science applications. Additional refinement of the expectations for undergraduate data science education is warranted. © Copyright 2021 Oliver and McNeil Distributed under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0","Computer science; Curricula; Data science; Education; Ethics; Machine learning; Statistics","Application programs; Curricula; Education computing; Electric grounding; Philosophical aspects; Statistics; Students; Ethical considerations; Interdisciplinary fields; Load distributions; Science applications; Science education; Statistical approach; Undergraduate education; Undergraduate program; Data Science",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aasheim, CL, Williams, S, Rutner, P, Gardiner, A., Data analytics vs. data science: a study of similarities and differences in undergraduate programs based on course descriptions (2015) Journal of Information Systems Education, 26, pp. 103-115; Anderson, P, Bowring, J, McCauley, R, Pothering, G, Starr, C., An undergraduate degree in data science: curriculum and a decade of implementation experience (2014) SIGCSE 2014: Proceedings of the 45th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 145-150. , New York:Association for Computing Machinery; Anderson, P, McGuffee, J, Uminsky, D., Data science as an undergraduate degree (2014) SIGCSE 2014 - Proceedings of the 45th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 705-706. , New York: Association for Computing Machinery; Berthold, MR., What Does it take to be a successful data scientist?

In general, the processing related to the higher-order tensor is so complicated that we have been developing understanding support tools for it using 3D puzzles from the viewpoint of making students interested. However, although these tools have been tried by students in graduation studies and other some occasions, their introduction into lectures was one issue. Therefore, in this study, we developed a new programming exercise material for the higher-order tensor, which is supposed to be used in data science subjects, by using a 3D puzzle. This learning material is also composed of Microsoft Teams, and students can access the material remotely to learn programming. In this paper, several students actually tried this material. As a result, it was found that the students themselves could create and submit assignment reports by viewing explanatory videos and performing exercises. From this, it is expected that this material will be able to introduce to data science courses, including online use. © 2021 by the authors.","3D puzzle; Data science education; Higher-order tensor; Programing materials; R; Remote exercise",,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN: JP18K11596","This work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI (Grants-in Aid for Scientific Research) under Grant No. JP18K11596.",,,,,,,,,,"Eldén, L., Matrix methods in data mining and pattern recognition (2007) SIAM, , ch. 8 and ch. 14; Ishida, A., Yamamoto, N., Murakami, J., Oishi, N., Solving 3-D puzzles using tensor decomposition and application to education of multidimensional data analysis (2018) International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing, 8 (5), pp. 447-453. , October; Yamamoto, N., Murakami, J., Ishida, A., Using 3D puzzles to help understand tensor decomposition programming (2019) Proc. the Annual Software Symposium in Kumamoto, pp. 115-124. , June; Yamamoto, N., Ishida, A., Oishi, N., Murakami, J., Development of teaching tool for supporting understanding of tensor decomposition using MacMahon‟s coloured cubes (2020) International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 10 (1), pp. 14-19. , January; Team, R.

As an interdisciplinary science it integrates knowledge and methods from computer science, mathematics and statistics, and the domain knowledge of the data. As data science is still forming as a domain, several points of view exist on how to teach data science. The curriculum of many undergraduate data science programs includes advanced knowledge and skills in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and one or more data domains. Several initiatives for designing high school data science curricula have emerged recently. Since it is unrealistic to teach all the above-mentioned advanced topics at the high school level, the high school data science curriculum focuses on a broad understanding of the data science workflow rather than on mathematical and algorithmic details that characterize undergraduate programs. High school computer science pupils, however, are expected to have a deep understanding of algorithms, as algorithms are the heart of computer science. In this paper, we present our attempt to adapt a data science course to computer science high school pupils that incorporates both a broad view on data science and data workflow, as well as deep understanding of data processing algorithms and specifically, machine learning.

Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis of research publications on data science was made of papers published in the Web of Science database to identify the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective. Findings: A content analysis of 80 publications is presented. The articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. The category of tools, techniques and applications of data science was most addressed by the authors, followed by data science from the perspective of health sciences, data science education and training and knowledge and skills of the data professional. However, several publications fell into several categories because these topics were closely related. Research limitations/implications: Only publication recorded in the Web of Science database and with the term “data science” in the topic area were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that either were related to other keywords such as “e-science”, “e-research”, “data service”, “data curation”, “research data management” or “scientific data management” or were not present in the Web of Science database. Originality/value: The paper provides the first exploration by content analysis of the field of data science from the perspective of the LIS. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Content analysis; Data science; Education; Information science; Library science; Literature review","Data Science; Database systems; Knowledge management; Publishing; Content analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Education and training; Health science; Library and information science; Library science; Literature reviews; Science education; Science-data; Web of Science; Libraries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, R., Dhar, V., Big data, data science, and analytics: the opportunity and challenge for IS research (2014) Information Systems Research, 25 (3), pp. 443-448; Alluqmani, A., Shamir, L., Writing styles in different scientific disciplines: a data science approach (2018) Scientometrics, 115 (2), pp. 1071-1085; Almugbel, R., Hung, L.H., Hu, J., Almutairy, A., Ortogero, N., Tamta, Y., Yeung, K.Y., Reproducible Bioconductor workflows using browser-based interactive notebooks and containers (2018) Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 25 (1), pp. 4-12; Amirian, P., van Loggerenberg, F., Lang, T., Data science and analytics (2017) Big Data in Healthcare, SpringerBriefs in Pharmaceutical Science and Drug Development, pp. 15-37. , Amirian, P., Lang, T. and van Loggerenberg, F., and,(Eds), Springer, Cham; Antell, K., Foote, J.B., Turner, J., Shults, B., Dealing with data: science librarians’ participation in data management at association of research libraries institutions (2014) College and Research Libraries, 75 (4), pp. 557-574; Aristodemou, L., Tietze, F., The state-of-the-art on intellectual property analytics (IPA): a literature review on artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning methods for analysing intellectual property (IP) data (2018) World Patent Information, 55, pp. 37-51; Barbuti, N., Caldarola, T., Ferilli, S., A graphic matching process for searching and retrieving information in digital libraries of manuscripts (2018) Digital Libraries and Multimedia Archives.

Here, we summarize key distinctions between these two strategies in three aspects and list five practical guidelines for data analysts to choose the appropriate strategy for specific analysis needs. We demonstrate the use of those guidelines in a cancer driver gene prediction example. In data science education, two analysis strategies, hypothesis testing and binary classification, are mostly covered in different courses and textbooks. In real data application, it can be puzzling whether a binary decision problem should be formulated as hypothesis testing or binary classification. This article aims to disentangle the puzzle for data science students and researchers by offering practical guidelines for choosing between the two strategies. Hypothesis testing and binary classification are two data analysis strategies taught mostly in different undergraduate classes and rarely compared with each other. As a result, which strategy is more appropriate for a specific real-world data analysis task is often ambiguous. To address this issue, this perspective article clarifies the distinctions between the two strategies and offers practical guidelines to the broad data science discipline. © 2020 The Author(s)","DSML 1: Concept: Basic principles of a new data science output observed and reported","Data handling; Industrial research; Machine learning; Testing; Analysis strategies; Binary classification; Hypothesis testing; Practical guidelines; Science disciplines; Science education; Scientific researches; Statistical hypothesis testing; Data Science",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1846216",,,,,,,,,,,"Lehmann, E.L., Romano, J.P., Testing Statistical Hypotheses (2006), Springer Science &Business Media; Murphy, K.P., Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (2012), MIT press; Wasserman, L., All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference (2013), Springer Science &Business Media; Distinguishing between two groups in statistics and machine learning: hypothesis test vs. classification vs. clustering (2016), https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/262686/distinguishing-between-two-groups-in-statistics-and-machine-learning-hypothesis; Why is binary classification not a hypothesis test?

Innovation, computation, and technological advances have now tremendously accelerated the pace of discovery, providing driverless cars, robotic devices, expert healthcare systems, precision medicine, and automated discovery to mention a few. Even though the definition of the term data science continues to evolve, the sweeping impact it has already produced on society is undeniable. We are at a point when new discoveries through data science have enormous potential to advance progress but also to be used maliciously, with harmful ethical and social consequences. Perhaps nowhere is this more clearly exemplified than in the biological and medical sciences. The confluence of (1) machine learning, (2) mathematical modeling, (3) computation/simulation, and (4) big data have moved us from the sequencing of genomes to gene editing and individualized medicine; yet, unsettled policies regarding data privacy and ethical norms could potentially open doors for serious negative repercussions. The data science revolution has amplified the urgent need for a paradigm shift in undergraduate biology education. It has reaffirmed that data science education interacts and enhances mathematical education in advancing quantitative conceptual and skill development for the new generation of biologists. These connections encourage us to strive to cultivate a broadly skilled workforce of technologically savvy problem-solvers, skilled at handling the unique challenges pertaining to biological data, and capable of collaborating across various disciplines in the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. To accomplish this, we suggest development of open curricula that extend beyond the job certification rhetoric and combine data acumen with modeling, experimental, and computational methods through engaging projects, while also providing awareness and deep exploration of their societal implications. This process would benefit from embracing the pedagogy of experiential learning and involve students in open-ended explorations derived from authentic inquiries and ongoing research. On this foundation, we encourage development of flexible data science initiatives for the education of life science undergraduates within and across existing models. © 2020, Society for Mathematical Biology.","Big data; Data science education; Education reform; Mathematical biology education","biology; curriculum; education; human; Computational Biology; Curriculum; Data Science; Humans",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: -1300426; University of Tennessee, UT","The first author was partially supported by the Karl Peace Fellowship in Mathematics, Randolph-Macon College, VA.

Specifically, the main focus will be on tackling already present challenges in data science education and a solution presented around DS Lab, an interactive computational notebook. The core ideas are represented by the concept of extending the traditional computing notebooks, especially from the Jupyter family, with live visualizations, debugging, widgets, and interactivity during the educational process across all the major platforms: web, Android, and IOS. The features are outlined in several use cases that can be useful in the data-science teaching process, with a primary focus in matrix manipulations, scatter plots, and image filters.

This paper contributes to the literature on data science education by examining the sociotechnical practices of data wrangling—strategies for selecting and managing large, aggregated datasets to produce a model and story. We examined the learning opportunities related to data wrangling practices by investigating youth’s talk-in-interaction while assembling models and stories about family migration using interactive data visualization tools and large socioeconomic datasets. We first identified ten sociotechnical practices that characterize youth’s interaction with tools and collaboration in data wrangling. We then suggest four categories of activities to describe patterns of learning related to the practices, including addressing missing data, understanding data aggregation, exploring social or historical events that constitute the formation of data patterns, and varying data visual encoding for storytelling. These practices and activities are important to understand for supporting future data science education opportunities that facilitate learning and discussion about scientific and socioeconomic issues. This study also sheds light on how the family migration modeling context positions the youth as having agency and authority over the data and contributes to the design of CSCL environments that tackle the challenges of data wrangling. © 2020, International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.","Data visualization; Data wrangling; Family migration; Modeling; Sociotechnical practices; Storytelling",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, CISE: 1341882","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number 1341882.

The radical growth in recent years in the availability of data and of the computational resources required to process them, has led to a corresponding increase in demand for data scientists. As a result, new data science education programs are opening at a growing rate. Over the past few years, several papers on data science programs were published, focusing on their curricular aspects. The pedagogy of those programs, however, has received only little attention. To partially close this gap, my doctoral research focuses on the pedagogical aspects of data science. The pilot phase of the research was carried out in graduate, undergraduate, and high school data science programs. The results of the pilot research are organized by a framework of ten challenges of data science education whose purpose is to improve our understanding of the pedagogical challenges of data science education for various populations and to develop pedagogical methods for coping with them. The current stage of research aims to validate this framework. © 2020 Owner/Author.","computer science education; data science education","Population statistics; Computational resources; Doctoral research; Pedagogical aspects; Pedagogical method; Radical growth; Research focus; Science education; Science programs; Data Science",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Berman, F., Realizing the potential of data science (2018) Commun Acm, 61 (4), pp. 67-72. , Mar; Raj, R.K., Data science education: Global perspectives and convergence (2019) Annu.

Recent news stories about data breaches and algorithmic biases indicate that big data projects raise ethical concerns with the potential to inflict harm on a wide societal or global scale. In this paper, we address three main research questions: (1) what curricular recommendations have been proposed for the teaching of ethics in undergraduate data science courses, (2) what codes of ethics are relevant to data science, and (3) how can we characterize the proposed codes to help an educator choose which to include in a data science course? We conclude with an overview of an approach to teaching ethics in undergraduate data science courses. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",,"Philosophical aspects; Teaching; Ethical concerns; Ethics education; Global scale; Research questions; Science course; Science education; Science programs; Teaching ethics; Data Science",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF","2.1 National Science Foundation (NSF)",,,,,,,,,,"(2016) Realizing the Potential of Data Science, Final Report from the National Science Foundation Computer and Information Science and Engineering Advisor Committee Data Science Working Group, , National Science Foundation, co-chairs: Francine Berman and Rob Rutenbar, December; (2016) Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Data Science, Annual Review of Statistics, , http://www.annualreviews.org, Park City Math Institute, [online] available; Draft Curriculum Framework: Abbreviated Topics List, , http://www.idssp.org/files/IDSSPDraftFrameworkAbbreviatedLists.pdf, International Data Science in Schools Project, [online] available: [accessed: 6/29/19]; Wing, J.M., Janeja, V.P., Kloefkorn, T., Erickson, L.C., (2018) Data Science Leadership Summit: Summary Report, , National Science Foundation Technical Report; Data Science Ethics Resources, , https://tinyurl.com/ethics-courses, curated by Prof. Casey Fiesler at Colorado University [online] available: [accessed: 6/29/19]; (2017) Envisioning the Data Science Discipline: The Undergraduate Perspective: Interim Report, , The National Academies of Science/Engineering/Medicine; Matei, S., Collmann, J., Steinmann, M., A Theoretical Framework for Ethical Reflection in Big Data Research (2016) Ethical Reasoning in Big Data: An Exploratory Analysis, , Collmann, J., Matei, S.A.

Students of Data Science area usually face the difficulty of understanding the complex of real-time data and sophisticated statistical indicators and models. Another difficulty is students are easy to lost interests and patience during the process of learning programming and analysis process, such as R-language. Stock market, as a huge data source and an important data disciplinary, is comparatively easy to attract student attentions. Thus, we developed an intuitive trading platform for education purpose. The platform contains three components: an exploring window, a control windows and a report window. The exploring window shows current and historical stock price trends and related indicators. Several representative stocks from different sectors can be picked and specific time frames can be assigned. The control window allows students to develop their own trading strategies. A trading strategy can be created by either intuitive way, or through single or combinations of indicators, or be built generically though plug-in R-programing module. The report window demonstrates the expected return of a stock in a specific time frame through a specific strategy. A more comprehensive report with detailed transaction information is also provided for back-testing purpose. Students are involved into the development of the software and get experience for R-programming. Preliminary version of the product has been tested and surveyed in a data science classroom. About ten junior Data Science students have practiced and provided feedback. The positive survey results show the feasibility of the approach. In the future, artificial intelligent component will be integrated into the platform. © 2020 IEEE.","Data Science; R-Programming; Trading Platform","Commerce; Data Science; Education computing; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Surveys; Analysis process; Artificial intelligent; Process of learning; Science classroom; Science education; Statistical indicators; Trading strategies; Transaction information; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Metz, C., (2017), https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/technology/artificialintelligence-experts-salaries.html, 22 Oct.

Although extracurricular efforts already exist for many computationally intensive disciplines, their support of data science education has significantly helped in coping with the speed of innovation in data science practice and formal curricula. While the proliferation of ad hoc efforts is an indication of their popularity, less has been documented about the needs that they are designed to meet, the limitations that they face, and practical suggestions for holding successful efforts. To holistically understand the role of different ad hoc formats for data science, we surveyed organizers of ad hoc data science education efforts to understand how organizers perceived the events to have gone-including areas of strength and areas requiring growth. We also gathered recommendations from these past events for future organizers. Our results suggest that the perceived benefits of ad hoc efforts go beyond developing technical skills and may provide continued benefit in conjunction with formal curricula, which warrants further investigation. As increasing numbers of researchers from computational fields with a history of complex data become involved with ad hoc efforts to share their skills, the lessons learned that we extract from the surveys will provide concrete suggestions for the practitioner-leaders interested in creating, improving, and sustaining future efforts. © 2020 DeMasi et al.",,"Curricula; Surveys; Ad hoc datum; Complex data; Computational field; Perceived benefits; Science education; Technical skills; Data Science; article; data science; education; human; human experiment; leadership; physician; skill; curriculum; procedures; questionnaire; Curriculum; Data Science; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Zweben, S., Bizot, B., 2017 CRA taulbee survey (2018) Computing Research News, 30 (5), pp. 1-47; Cao, L., Data science: A comprehensive overview (2017) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 50 (3), p. 43; Allen, G., Benger, W., Hutanu, A., Jha, S., Löffler, F., Schnetter, E., A practical and comprehensive graduate course preparing students for research involving scientific computing (2011) Procedia Computer Science, 4, pp. 1927-1936; Atwood, T.K., Bongcam-Rudloff, E., Brazas, M.E., Corpas, M., Gaudet, P., Lewitter, F., GOBLET: The global organisation for bioinformatics learning, education and training (2015) PLoS Comput Biol., 11 (4). , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004143, PMID: 25856076; Baumer, B., A data science course for undergraduates: Thinking with data (2015) The American Statistician, 69 (4), pp. 334-342; Çetinkaya-Rundel, M., Rundel, C., Infrastructure and tools for teaching computing throughout the statistical curriculum (2018) The American Statistician, 72 (1), pp. 58-65; Clark, D., Culich, A., Hamlin, B., Lovett, R., BCE: Berkeley's common scientific compute environment for research and education (2014) Proceedings of the 13th Python in Science Conference (SciPy 2014), pp. 5-13; Hill, B.M., Dailey, D., Guy, R.T., Lewis, B., Matsuzaki, M., Morgan, J.T., Democratizing data science: The community data science workshops and classes (2017) Big Data Factories, pp. 115-135. , Springer; Jacobs, C.T., Gorman, G.J., Rees, H.E., Craig, L.E., Experiences with efficient methodologies for teaching computer programming to geoscientists (2016) Journal of Geoscience Education, 64 (3), pp. 183-198; Millman, J.K., Brett, M., Barnowski, R., Poline, J.B., Experiences with efficient methodologies for teaching computer programming to geoscientists (2018) Frontiers in Neuroscience, 12, p. 727. , https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00727; (2018) Creating Institutional Change in Data Science, , http://msdse.org/files/Creating_Institutional_Change.pdf, [cited 2020 Apr17]; West, J., Portenoy, J., The data gold rush in higher education (2016) Big Data Is Not A Monolith; Sugimoto, C.R., Ekbia, H.R., Mattioli, M., The data gold rush in higher education (2016) Big Data Is Not A Monolith, MITP, pp. 129-139; Huppenkothen, D., Arendt, A., Hogg, D.W., Ram, K., VanderPlas, J.T., Rokem, A., Hack weeks as a model for data science education and collaboration (2018) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 115 (36), pp. 8872-8877; Rokem, A., Aragon, C., Arendt, A., Fiore-Gartland, B., Hazelton, B., Hellerstein, J., Building an urban data science summer program at the university of Washington eScience institute (2015) Bloomberg Data for Good Exchange Conference; Wilson, G., Software carpentry: Lessons learned (2016) F1000Research, p. 3. , https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.7209.1; Alnoamany, Y., Borghi, J.A., Towards computational reproducibility: Researcher perspectives on the use and sharing of software (2018) PeerJ., 4, p. e163; Wilson, G., Aruliah, D.A., Brown, C.T., Hong, N.P.C., Davis, M., Guy, R.T., Best practices for scientific computing (2014) PLoS Biol., 12 (1). , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745, PMID: 24415924; Holdgraf, C., Culich, A., Rokem, A., Deniz, F., Alegro, M., Ushizima, D., Portable learning environments for hands-on computational instruction: Using container-and cloud-based technology to teach data science (2017) Proceedings of the Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing 2017 on Sustainability, Success and Impact.

However, there is little research on ethics education in computer science that explicitly addresses data ethics. We present and analyze Re-Shape, a method to teach students about the ethical implications of data collection and use. Re-Shape, as part of an educational environment, builds upon the idea of cultivating care and allows students to collect, process, and visualize their physical movement data in ways that support critical reflection and coordinated classroom activities about data, data privacy, and human-centered systems for data science. We also use a case study of Re-Shape in an undergraduate computer science course to explore prospects and limitations of instructional designs and educational technology such as Re-Shape that leverage personal data to teach data ethics. © 2020 ACM.","care ethics; computer science education; data ethics; data literacy; data privacy; data science education; information visualization; interaction geography slicer; re-shape","Data privacy; Data Science; Education computing; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Philosophical aspects; Critical reflections; Educational environment; Ethical implications; Human centered systems; Human computer interaction (HCI); Instructional designs; Physical movements; Undergraduate computer science course; Students",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; Vanderbilt University","We thank the National Science Foundation, Kendeda Foundation and the Living Building Challenge at Georgia Tech, and Vanderbilt University for generously supporting this work.

It takes tons of time to read the experimental section of thousands of papers and figure out the performance of the data science techniques. In this work, we build an experimental evidence extraction system to automate the integration of tables (in the paper PDFs) into a database of experimental results. First, it crops the tables and recognizes the templates. Second, it classifies the column names and row names into ""method"", ""dataset"", or ""evaluation metric"", and then unified all the table cells into (method, dataset, metric, score)-quadruples. We propose hybrid features including structural and semantic table features as well as an ensemble learning approach for column/row name classification and table unification.

Project-based learning (PBL) is a well-known pedagogical tool for interdisciplinary education. In order to successfully accomplish interdisciplinary learning, students must have sufficient knowledge in each of the separate disciplines. Use of cross-disciplinary teams, for example, is one way to make sure a project team includes specialists in all required disciplines. This, however, is not always the case. In many cases, there are significant knowledge gaps within the project team in one or more of the project domains. Specifically, in our case, fourth-year electrical engineering students are working in pairs on biomedical signal processing projects, which are evidently interdisciplinary in nature. The teams, however, are homogeneous and the students lack the essential medical expertise required to achieve solutions applicable by physicians. Furthermore, students tend to acknowledge this gap only in the advanced phases of the project, and so critical phases, such as goal setting and planning, are performed without the required knowledge. In this article, we present (a) data that supports the existence of this knowledge gap and its effect on students; (b) an intervention program that exposes students to both the required domain knowledge and its importance to their work; and (c) initial data that supports the success of this intervention program in bridging these gaps. © 2020 IEEE.","Biomedical signal processing; Data science education; Interdisciplinary education; Project-based learning","Biomedical signal processing; C (programming language); Engineering education; Cross-disciplinary teams; Electrical engineering students; Interdisciplinary education; Interdisciplinary learning; Intervention programs; Pedagogical tools; Project based learning; Real-life problems; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alvargonza, D., Multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, and the sciences (2011) Int.

Keeping in mind, the growing importance of data science, under-graduates need to be introduced to data science courses in their first year of under-graduation itself. Although first year undergraduates are furnished with the required mathematical and statistical concepts during their higher secondary education, a requirement of understanding sophisticated programming concepts hamstrings universities from offering courses in data science to first year undergraduates. As an outcome of our research, we propose a software named MetaData. MetaData abstracts all levels of implementation and helps students better understand the fundamental concepts in data science by observing the applicability of these concepts on real-world datasets. We justify the effectiveness of the tool through a data science classroom scenario, wherein 44 first year undergraduates were encouraged to use the tool and provide constructive feedback. © 2020 ACM.","Data Science Education; Data Science Lifecycle; Pedagogy; User-friendly Tool","Metadata; Constructive feedback; Fundamental concepts; Programming concepts; Real-world datasets; Science classroom; Science course; Science education; Statistical concepts; Data Science",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"IIT Bombay: An Indian University Curriculum, , https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/page95; De Veaux Richard, D., Agarwal, M., Averett, M., Baumer, B.S., Bray, A., Bressoud, T.C., Bryant, L., Gould, R., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science (2017) Annu.

Assignments and projects are essential parts of the DS curriculum as they enable students to gain hands-on experience in real-world DS tasks. However, most current assignments and projects are lacking in at least one of two ways: 1) they do not comprehensively teach all the steps involved in the complete workflow of DS projects; 2) students work on separate problems individually or in small teams, limiting the scale and impact of their solutions. To overcome these limitations, we envision novel synergistic modular assignments where a large number of students work collectively on all the tasks equired to develop a large-scale DS product. The resulting product can be continuously improved with students' contributions every semester. We report our experience with developing and deploying such an assignment in an Information Retrieval course. Through the assignment, students collectively developed a search engine for finding expert faculty specializing in a given field.

This transition has accelerated over the last five years and training in statistics, machine learning, and data analysis has struggled to keep up. In April 2014, we launched a program of nine courses, the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization, which has now had more than 4 million enrollments over the past five years. Here, the program is described and compared to standard data science curricula as they were organized in 2014 and 2015. We show that novel pedagogical and administrative decisions introduced in our program are now standard in online data science programs. The impact of the Data Science Specialization on data science education in the U.S. is also discussed.

This work depicts the interdisciplinary landscape of iSchools from research outcomes publication knowledge  diffusion input reference output citation and school level based on the WoS publications of 36 iCaucus members in iSchools from 2009 to 2018. Interdisciplinarity is measured by three indicators namely variety balance and intensity. We found that 1 The interdisciplinary characteristics of research outcomes are high subject variety and high subject imbalance. Firstly the papers published by iSchools include 227 disciplines covering 89. 37% of the WoS subject classification the number of disciplines involved in the papers is generally increasing. Secondly the publications are relatively concentrated on a few disciplines such as library and information science and computer science. In addition the overall interdisciplinary intensity of research outcomes is 56. 81% which means 56. 81% of publications involved two or more disciplines reflecting their multidisciplinary nature. 2 The interdisciplinary characteristics of knowledge diffusion are high subject variety and relatively high subject imbalance. Firstly knowledge input and knowledge output cover around 254 WoS subject classifications which shows researches of iSchools are relatively open. Secondly according to the cumulative percentage of the disciplinary distribution the top ten disciplines in knowledge input and output have respectively reached 44% and 46% indicating the relative concentration of knowledge diffusion. In addition the interdisciplinary intensity of knowledge input is 54. 71% indicating that iSchools have cited many papers from other disciplines and their development is mainly related to the cross-border integration of multidisciplinary knowledge. The interdisciplinary intensity of knowledge output is 55. 11% which indicates that iSchools papers have been widely cited by papers from other disciplines and iSchools have formed a strong capacity to output and to infiltrate knowledge to other disciplines. 3 The interdisciplinary characteristics of iSchools members are quite different. The interdisciplinary diversity of UC Irvine Cornell University and Monash University are at the forefront while the interdisciplinary diversity of Humboldt University of Berlin San Jose State University and Renmin University of China lag behind. UC Irvine and Cornell University publish very low percentages of papers in library and information  science. According to the factor analysis of research outcomes knowledge input and knowledge output 36 colleges can be divided into six categories library information computer science data science education research communication and management. The number of colleges in the library and information category is the largest. 4 Library and information science is closely related to iField but significant differences also exist. Library and information science is the subject with the highest proportion of research outputs and the most important source of knowledge for the iField. But the proportion is not high with 22. 87% in research outcomes 13. 05% in reference and 8. 88% in cited paper. It also indicates a downward trend over time. The tendency of iSchools to eliminate library and information science is obvious. In addition though many colleges are currently classified in library and information science subject many of them have a clear trend of diversification. There are several limitations in this study. Taking the iCaucus member as an example to explore the interdisciplinary characteristics of iSchools researches the generalizability of its conclusions needs to be further verified. Second in addition to the diversity balance and intensity combining with more comprehensive indicators may make the conclusion more credible and complete. Finally the sample data from WoS are insufficient to implement a thorough bibliometric analysis. 4 figs. 7 tabs. 56 refs. © 2020, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

In this study we present initial results from an ongoing qualitative study of an interdisciplinary cyberinfrastructure-focused NSF-funded graduate data science education workshop hosted at an iSchool in the US. The complexity of the workshop curriculum, the participants’ and instructors’ disparate disciplinary backgrounds, and the technical tools employed are particularly suited to qualitative methods which can synthesize all of these aspects from rich observational, ethnographic, and trace data collected as part of the authors’ role on the grant’s qualitative evaluation team. The success of the workshop in equipping participants to do reproducible computational science was in part due to the successful acculturation process, whereby participants comprehended, altered, and enacted new norms amongst themselves. At the same time, we observed potential challenges for data science instruction resulting from the rhetorical framing of the technologies as inescapably new. This language, which mirrors that of a successful grant proposal, tends to obscure the deeply embedded and contingent history of the command-line technologies required to preform computational science, many of which are decades old. We conclude by describing our ongoing work, future theoretical sampling plans from this and future data, and the contributions that our findings can provide to graduate data science curriculum development and pedagogy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Data science education; Grounded theory; Temporality","Curricula; Computational science; Cyber infrastructures; Graduate education; Qualitative evaluations; Qualitative method; Science curriculum; Science education; Science instructions; Data Science",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1730390","This work was partially supported by National Science Foundation grant 1730390.",,,,,,,,,,"Adolph, S., Hall, W., Kruchten, P., Using grounded theory to study the experience of software development (2011) Empir.

This has led to over a decade of calls to establish a corresponding field of Data Science Education. There is still a need, however, to more deeply conceptualize what a field of Data Science Education might entail in terms of scope, responsibility, and execution. This special issue explores how one distinguishing feature of Data Science—its focus on data collected from social and environmental contexts within which learners often find themselves deeply embedded—suggests serious implications for learning and education. The learning sciences is uniquely positioned to investigate how such contextual embeddings impact learners’ engagement with data including conceptual, experiential, communal, racialized, spatial, and political dimensions. This special issue demonstrates the richly layered relationships learners build with data and reveals them to be not merely utilitarian mechanisms for learning about data, but a critical part of navigating data as social text and understanding Data Science as a discipline. Together, the contributions offer a vision of how the learning sciences can contribute to a more expansive, agentive and socially aware Data Science Education. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: IIS-1541676","Many ideas discussed in this introduction emerged from collective discussion at the 2016 Youth, Learning, and Data Science Summit.

This paper reports on a design study in which diverse middle and high school youth in a free summer workshop at an urban public library were asked to model their family geobiographies, or their personal family migration stories, with socioeconomic LSDS. Youth represented family decision-making and social conditions that might have motivated family movements with online, dynamic data modeling and mapping tools (Gapminder.org; SocialExplorer.com). The qualitative video analysis examined participants’ experiences and learning in storytelling and modeling the family geobiography, focusing on multimodal talk-in-interaction to understand how the study design engaged learners’ capacities, histories, and imagined futures in relation to the LSDS and supported learning about oneself and society. Grounded examples from two family cases are used to illustrate how participants placed their families and selves into data ontologies and the role of family members in composing storylines. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1341882","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant #1341882.",,,,,,,,,,"Axelrod, D., Kahn, J., Intergenerational family storytelling and modeling with large-scale data sets (2019) Proceedings of the 18th ACM International Conference on Interaction Design and Children, pp. 352-360. , Fails J.A., (ed), New York, NY: ACM, &,.

One promising phenomenon investigated in related work is perspective-taking. A first-person “actor” perspective can help facilitate group and individual sensemaking by mediating observations and actions taken by learners. Here we investigate how museum visitors made use of an actor perspective when exploring an open-ended, interactive data map museum exhibit. We use a mix of qualitative and quantitative empirical methods to explore how actor perspective-taking (APT) may mediate joint sensemaking around data visualizations. By applying interpretive coding to 54 conversations wherein APT naturalistically emerged, we identify 3 distinct self-to-data relationships constructed via APT: role-play, projection, and orientation. A further analysis explores how APT was embedded in joint sensemaking of the visualized data. Twelve APT-mediated sensemaking processes are identified; two (extrapolating and noticing absence) were used in conjunction with multiple APT self-to-data relationships, while the remaining ten (e.g., enacting, spatially characterizing, generalizing) were exclusively used with specific self-to-data APT relationships. We use these empirical findings to generate hypotheses about how APT and associated sensemaking processes may support Data Science learning goals. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1248052; National Endowment for the Humanities, NEH: HD 51357","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [NSF INSPIRE 1248052] and the National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant HD 51357].",,,,,,,,,,"Abrahamson, D., Bakker, A., Making sense of movement in embodied design for mathematics learning (2016) Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications, 11 (33). , Article; Allen, S., Looking for learning in visitor talk: A methodological exploration (2002) Learning Conversations in Museums, pp. 259-303. , Leinhardt G., Crowley K., Knutson K., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum,.

Current pedagogy has focused either on data science or on purely analytic technical aspects. There is therefore, an opportunity to rethink how institutions can develop innovative data-focussed education programmes, addressing both modern industry and community demands. As both academia and industry strive to integrate applied learning, transferable and enterprise skills into business and sciences, this paper proposes a design based research approach (DBR) for designing such a new interdisciplinary data science teaching curriculum as a foundation to deliver business undergraduate degrees in Business Data Science. Adopting a design science method our proposed DBR illustrates effective utilities for conceptualising and evaluating a fully functional new degree programme - Bachelor of Business Data Science. Ten senior business information systems academics and five analytics industry practitioners in Victoria, Australia were interviewed in three iterative prototyping phases followed by a final focus group session with business information systems students that evaluated the proposed structure. The findings suggest that proposed DBR ensures the design of an innovative data science degree that may meet growing industry and interdisciplinary demands. The paper concludes by discussing overall feasibility of the proposal in the Australian higher education sector, particularly for the case context of an Australian University. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Business curriculum; Data science education; Higher education; Information systems education",,,,,,"Victoria University, VU","This work was supported by a Fellowship Programme 2019 (ethical approval ref.: HRE18-184) under the Institute for Sustainable Industries and Liveable Cities, Victoria University, Melbourne.

It aims to introduce and justify the framework that allows flexibly evaluate the processes of a data expedition and a digital media created during it. For these purposes, the authors explore features of digital media artefacts which are specific to data expeditions and are essential to accurate evaluation. The rubrics as a power but hardly formalizable evaluation method in application to digital media artefacts are also discussed. Moreover, the paper documents the experience of rubrics creation according to the suggested framework. The rubrics were successfully adopted to two data-driven journalism courses. The authors also formulate recommendations on data expedition evaluation which should take into consideration structural features of a data expedition, distinctive features of digital media, etc. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Collaborative technologies; Data expedition; Data science; Education","Data Science; Education; Collaborative learning; Collaborative technologies; Data driven journalisms; Data expedition; Formative assessment; Paper documents; Science education; Structural feature; Digital storage",,,,,"Health and Safety Executive, HSE; National Research University Higher School of Economics, HES","Acknowledgment.

At first, only HSE-students of the first-year “Data Journalism” master program was involved into this activity. At second, the participation was obligatory because the DE acted as an assessment after several modules of the Scientific Research Seminar, “Open data” and “Introductory programming” courses. This explains by that the DE was targeted to evaluate complex skills in data-driven journalism which should have been shaped by the end of the first year of education. At third, DE was preceded by short in-class session where students divided into working teams and took part in discussion on evaluation rubrics. At fourth, collaboration between participants and administrators was supported by Microsoft Office 365 Education (using OneNote Class Notebook [24]).",,,,,,,,,"(2013), http://cds.nyu.edu/research/, Accessed 14 July 2017; (2017), https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/data-science, Accessed 14 July 2017; Anderson, P., Nash, T., McCauley, R., Faciliatating programming success in data science courses through gamified scafollding and Learn2Mine (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education; Jormanainen, I., Sutinen, E., An open approach for learning educational data mining (2013) Koli Calling’13, Koli; Bhargava, R., Deahl, E., Letouzé, E., Noonan, A., Sangokoya, D., Shoup, N., Beyond Data Literacy: Reinventing Community Engagement and Empowerment in the Age of Data (2015), , Accessed 26 June 2017; Data Expeditions, , https://schoolofdata.org/data-expeditions/(2013), Accessed 29 May 2017; Radchenko, I., Sakoyan, A., (2016) On Some Russian Educational Projects in Open Data and Data Journalism.

As a result of the field's fluidity, there is often a mismatch between what datarelated programs teach, what employers expect, and the actual tasks data scientists are performing. In addition, the tools available to data scientists are not necessarily the tools being taught; textbooks do not seem to meet curricular needs; and empirical evidence does not seem to support existing program design. Currently, the field appears to be bifurcating into data science (DS) and data engineering (DE), with specific but overlapping roles in the combined data science and engineering (DSE) lifecycle. However, curriculum design has not yet caught up to this evolution.

When the student population changes from Computer Science students to those in an Information Technology program where many of the core CS courses are not required, additional challenges arise. Couple these challenges with teaching non-traditional students who are also involved with their families and careers; the difficulty in teaching this material rises exponentially. For our experiment, we chose to teach the Hadoop Distributed File System, the Map/Reduce paradigm, and basic Hadoop programming to expose these students to Data Science technologies.

Unlike these disciplines, however, data science education remains heavily focused on theory and methods, and practical coursework typically revolves around cleaned or simplified data sets that have little analog in professional applications. We believe that the environment in which new data scientists are trained should more accurately reflect that in which they will eventually practice, and we propose here a data science master's degree program that takes inspiration from the residency model used in medicine. Students in the suggested program would spend their time working on a practical problem with an industry, government, or nonprofit partner, supplemented with coursework in data science methods and theory. We also discuss how this program can also be implemented in shorter formats to augment existing professional master's programs in different disciplines. This approach to learning by doing is designed to fill gaps in our current approach to data science education and ensure that students develop the skills they need to practice data science in a professional context and under the many constraints imposed by that context. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.","curriculum; data science; data science competencies; education; training","academic achievement; curriculum; education; medical ethics; organization and management; Curriculum; Data Science; Education, Graduate; Ethics, Professional",,,,,"Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Yale School of Medicine, CORE","For many of the skill domains described above, classroom-based coursework is an inefficient and ineffective method of building student competency.

Many scientific graduate degree programs expect students to acquire these computational skills in an applied statistics course. A gap remains, however, between the computational skills required for the implementation of statistics in scientific research and those taught in statistics courses. This qualitative study examines how five environmental science graduate students at one institution experience the phenomenon of acquiring the computational skills necessary to implement statistics in their research and the factors that foster or inhibit learning. In-depth interviews revealed three themes in these students' paths towards computational knowledge acquisition: use of peer support, seeking out a singular ""consultant, "" and learning through independent research experiences. These themes provide rich descriptions of graduate student experiences and strategies used while developing computational skills to apply statistics in their own research, thus informing how to improve instruction, both in and out of the formal classroom. © International Association for Statistical Education (IASE/ISI), November, 2019.","Data science education; Environmental sciences; Statistics education research",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andelman, S.J., Bowles, C.M., Willig, M.R., Waide, R.B., Understanding environmental complexity through a distributed knowledge network (2004) BioScience, 54 (3), pp. 240-246; Cobb, G., Mere renovation is too little too late: We need to rethink our undergraduate curriculum from the ground up (2015) The American Statistician, 69 (4), pp. 266-282; Cortina, T., An introduction to computer science for non-majors using principles of computation (2007) Proceedings of the 38th SIGCSE technical symposium on computer science education, pp. 218-222. , Covington, KY; Creswell, J., (2007) Qualitative inquiry and research design: Choosing among five approaches, , (2nd ed.).

This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Analysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective? Findings: The highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this research are that this study only analyzed research papers in the Web of Science database and therefore only covers a certain amount of scientific papers published in the field of LIS. In addition, only publications with the term “data science” in the topic area of the Web of Science database were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that are not reflected in the Web of Science database or were related to other keywords such as “e-science,” “e-research,” “data service,” “data curation” or “research data management.” Originality/value: The field of data science has not been explored using bibliographic analysis of publications from the perspective of the LIS. This paper helps to better understand the field of data science and the perspectives for information professionals. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliographic analysis; Business value; Data management; Data science; Data scientist; Information science; IoT; Library science; Literature review; Skills","Data Science; Database systems; Internet of things; Knowledge management; Publishing; Bibliographic analysis; Business value; Data scientist; Design/methodology/approach; IoT; Library and information science; Library science; Literature reviews; Skill; Web of Science; Libraries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, R., Dhar, V., Big data, data science, and analytics: the opportunity and challenge for IS research (2014) Information Systems Research, 25 (3), pp. 443-448; Akerkar, R., Sajja, P.S., (2016) Intelligent Techniques for Data Science, , Springer International Publishing, Cham; Amirian, P., van Loggerenberg, F., Lang, T., Data science and analytics (2017) Big Data in Healthcare, SpringerBriefs in Pharmaceutical Science & Drug Development, pp. 15-37. , Amirian, P., Lang, T. and van Loggerenberg, F., and,(Eds), Springer, Cham; Antell, K., Foote, J.B., Turner, J., Shults, B., Dealing with data: science librarians’ participation in data management at association of research libraries institutions (2014) College & Research Libraries, 75 (4), pp. 557-574; Aristodemou, L., Tietze, F., The state-of-the-art on intellectual property analytics (IPA): a literature review on artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning methods for analysing intellectual property (IP) data (2018) World Patent Information, 55, pp. 37-51; Baškarada, S., Koronios, A., Unicorn data scientist: the rarest of breeds (2017) Program, 51 (1), pp. 65-74; Bell, G., Hey, T., Szalay, A., Beyond the data deluge (2009) Science, 323 (5919), pp. 1297-1298; Bertolucci, J., (2013) Are you recruiting a data scientist or a unicorn?, , www.informationweek.com/big-data/big-data-analytics/are-you-recruiting-a-data-scientist-or-unicorn/d/d-id/899843, InformationWeek: (accessed, April 4, 2019; Borgman, C.L., (2015) Big Data, Little Data, No Data: Scholarship in the Networked World, , The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Brunner, R.J., Kim, E.J., Teaching data science (2016) Procedia Computer Science, 80, pp. 1947-1956; Cady, F., (2017) The Data Science Handbook, , John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ; Cao, L., (2018) Data Science Thinking: The Next Scientific, Technological and Economic Revolution, , Springer, Cham; Carter, D., Sholler, D., Data science on the ground: hype, criticism, and everyday work (2016) Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 67 (10), pp. 2309-2319; Cervone, H.F., Informatics and data science: an overview for the information professional (2016) Digital Library Perspectives, 32 (1), pp. 7-10; Chatfield, A.T., Shlemoon, V.N., Redublado, W., Rahman, F., Data scientists as game changers in big data environments (2014) Proceedings of the 25th Australasian Conference on Information Systems, Auckland University of Technology, pp. 1-11; Chen, C.P., Zhang, C.-Y., Data-intensive applications, challenges, techniques and technologies: a survey on big data (2014) Information Sciences, 275, pp. 314-347; Cleveland, W.S., Data science: an action plan for expanding the technical areas of the field of statistics (2001) International Statistical Review, 69 (1), pp. 21-26; Costa, C., Santos, M.Y., The data scientist profile and its representativeness in the European e-Competence framework and the skills framework for the information age (2017) International Journal of Information Management, 37 (6), pp. 726-734; Cukier, K., Mayer-Schönberger, V., The rise of big data: how it’s changing the way we think about the world (2013) Foreign Affairs, 92 (3), pp. 28-40; Davenport, T.H., Patil, D.J., Data scientist: the sexiest job of the 21st century (2012) Harvard Business Review, 90 (5), pp. 70-76. , www.hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century, (accessed, November 3, 2018; Demchenko, Y., Belloum, A., Wiktorski, T., (2017) EDISON data science framework: part 1.

However, data science education is not currently a graduation requirement at most colleges and universities. As a result, many graduates lack even basic knowledge of data science. To address the shortfall, academic institutions should incorporate introductory data science into general education courses. A general education IT course provides a unique opportunity to integrate data science education. Modules covering databases, spreadsheets, and presentation software, already present in many survey IT courses, teach concepts and skills needed for data science. As a result, a survey IT course can provide comprehensive introductory data science education by adding a data science module focused on modeling and evaluation, two key steps in the data science process. The module should use data science software for application, avoiding the complexities of programming and advanced math, while enabling an emphasis on conceptual understanding. We implemented a course built around these ideas and found that the course helps develop data savvy in students. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","CRISP-DM; Data Mining; Data Visualization; Database; Information Technology Education; Introductory Data Science","Application programs; Curricula; Data mining; Data Science; Database systems; Surveys; Academic institutions; Colleges and universities; Conceptual understanding; CRISP-DM; General education; Information technology education; National academies; Science education; Data visualization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, P., Bowring, J., McCauley, R., Pothering, G., Starr, C., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience (2014) Proceedings of the 45th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 145-150; Baumer, B., A data science course for undergraduates: Thinking with data (2015) The American Statistician, 69 (4), pp. 334-342. , 2015; Bonilla, C., (2015) Not A Data Scientist?

Data science is not an exception. In recent years scientists were concerned about a large number of irreproducible studies. Such reproducibility crisis in science could severely undermine public trust in science and science-based public policy. Recent efforts to promote reproducible research mainly focused on matured scientists and much less on student training. In this study, we conducted action research on students in data science to evaluate to what extent students are ready for communicating reproducible data analysis. The results show that although two-thirds of the students claimed they were able to reproduce results in peer reports, only one-third of reports provided all necessary information for replication. The actual replication results also include conflicting claims; some lacked comparisons of original and replication results, indicating that some students did not share a consistent understanding of what reproducibility means and how to report replication results. The findings suggest that more training is needed to help data science students communicating reproducible data analysis. © 2019 Chinese Academy of Sciences Published under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)","Action research; Communication; Data science education; Reproducibility; Reproducible data analysis","Data Science; Students; Action research; Data science education; Public trust; Reproducibilities; Reproducible data analyse; Reproducible research; Science education; Scientific researches; Student training; Data handling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2014) Providing new incentives to foster open science and increase reproducibility, , https://obssr.od.nih.gov/providing-new-incentives-foster-open-science-increase-reproducibility/, National Institutes of Health; King, G., Publication, publication (2006) PS: Political Science and Politics, 39 (1), pp. 119-125; (2016) 1500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility, , http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970, Nature; Kaiser, J., Rigorous replication effort succeeds for just two of five cancer papers, , http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/rigorous-replication-effort-succeeds-just-two-five-cancer-papers; Dewald, W.G., Thursby, G.J., Anderson, R.G., Replication in empirical economics: The Journal of Money, Credit and Banking project (1986) The American Economic Review, 76 (4), pp. 587-603; Peng, R.D., Dominici, F., Zeger, S.L., Reproducible epidemiologic research (2006) American Journal of Epidemiology, 163 (9), pp. 783-789; Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science (2015) Science, 349 (6251), p. aac4716. , Open Science Collaboration; Peng, R.D., Reproducible research in computational science (2011) Science, 334 (6060), pp. 1226-1227; King, G., Replication, replication (1955) PS: Political Science and Politics, 28 (3), pp. 444-452; Donoho, D.L., An invitation to reproducible computational research (2010) Biostatistics, 11 (3), pp. 385-388; Stodden, V., Miguez, S., Best practices for computational science: Software infrastructure and environments for reproducible and extensible research (2004) Journal of Open Research Software, 2 (1), p. e21; Howe, B., Communicating data science results MOOC course on Coursera, , https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-results/home/welcome; Peng, R., Disseminating reproducible research is fundamentally a language and communication problem, , http://simplystatistics.org/2016/05/13/reproducible-research-language/; Gentleman, R., Lang, D.T., Statistical analyses and reproducible research (2012) Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 16 (1), pp. 1-23; Knuth, D.E., Literate programming (1984) The Computer Journal, 27 (2), pp. 97-111; Dnuggets, K., Python eats away at R: Top software for analytics Data Science, Machine Learning in 2018: Trends and Analysis, , https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/poll-tools-analytics-data-science-machine-learning-results.html; Gandrud, C., (2013) Reproducible research with R and R studio, , Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, isbn: 9781498715379; How to create a minimal, complete, and verifiable example – help center – stack overflow, , http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve, Stackoverflow; Stringer, E.T., (2008) Action research in education, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, isbn: 9780132255189; Cohen, J., A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales (1960) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20, pp. 37-46","Hu, X.; University of Hong Kong, Room 209, Runme Shaw Building, Hong Kong; email: xiaoxhu@hku.hk",,,"MIT Press Journals",,,,,20967004,,,,"English","Data.

Data Science as a research and academic discipline provides a basis for Data Analytics and ML/AI applications. The education and training of the data related professions must reflect all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science and handling practitioners in modern, data-driven research and the digital economy. In the modern era, with ever faster technology changes, matched by strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training programme should be customizable and deliverable in multiple forms, tailored for different categories of professional roles and profiles. Referring to other publications by the authors on building customizable and interoperable Data Science curricula for different types of learners and target application domains, this paper is focused on defining a set of transversal competences and skills that are required from modern and future Data Science professions.

It is forecast that 75% of enterprise applications will use AI, Machine Learning or Deep Learning technology by 2021, yet university programs commonly place the burden on students to obtain their data science educations through elective coursework spanning multiple disparate departments. Data science requires specific mathematics preparation especially for cybersecurity students whose programs have reduced the requirements for advance mathematics to a bare minimum. To facilitate curricula preparation, and hands-on usage of AI tools, a notebook ('A Trellis For Novice AI Practitioners') was prepared in the R programming language as a first step in introducing computer science and cybersecurity students to the concepts and capabilities of AI. A focus on an intrusion detection data set to mitigate nine common cyber vulnerabilities is used in this analysis. Trellis bridges the theoretical and practical chasm for students by building an ANN network intrusion predictive model from scratch. It serves as a template but also encourages heavy contextual modification, and may be relied upon in the beginning stages of a cybersecurity practitioner's data science activities on a wide variety of data sets in all areas of the discipline. © 2019 IEEE.","AI; Deep-Belie/Network; DL; ML; R","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Computer programming; Curricula; Data Science; Deep learning; Education computing; Intrusion detection; Cyber vulnerabilities; Deep-Belie/Network; Enterprise applications; Learning technology; Network intrusions; Predictive modeling; Science activities; University programs; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Whitlock, J., Deploying ai in hospitals is delicate operation (2019) San Diego Business Journal, p. 1. , May 20, 2019; Hodnett, M., Wiley, J.F., (2018) R Deep Learning Essentials, , Second Edition, Packt Publishing, Birmingham, u.k; (2019) Idc, , https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180322005847/en/Worldwide-Spending-Cognitive-Artificial-Intelligence-Systems-Grow, May).

Many people who currently teach data science are practitioners such as computational researchers in academia or data scientists in industry. To understand how these practitioner-instructors pass their knowledge onto novices and how that contrasts with teaching more traditional forms of programming, we interviewed 20 data scientists who teach in settings ranging from small-group workshops to large online courses. We found that: 1) they must empathize with a diverse array of student backgrounds and expectations, 2) they teach technical workflows that integrate authentic practices surrounding code, data, and communication, 3) they face challenges involving authenticity versus abstraction in software setup, finding and curating pedagogically-relevant datasets, and acclimating students to live with uncertainty in data analysis. These findings can point the way toward better tools for data science education and help bring data literacy to more people around the world. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Data science education; Teaching programming","Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Students; Uncertainty analysis; Group workshops; Online course; Science education; Teaching programming; Work-flows; Data Science",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Education and Human Resources, EHR: 1735234; National Science Foundation, NSF","Thanks to the UC San Diego Design Lab, rOpenSci, Elissa Redmiles, and Os Keyes for their feedback, and NSF award #1735234 for funding.",,,,,,,,,,"(2017) The 50 Most Popular MOOCs of All Time, , http://www.onlinecoursereport.com/the-50-most-popular-moocs-of-all-time/; (2017) The Complete List of Data Science Bootcamps & Fellowships, , http://www.skilledup.com/articles/list-data-science-bootcamps; (2017) Project Jupyter, , http://jupyter.org/; (2018) Data Carpentry: Building Communities Teaching Universal Data Literacy, , https://datacarpentry.org/, Accessed: 2018-09-20; (2018) DataCamp: Learn R, Python & Data Science Online, , https://www.datacamp.com/, Accessed: 2018-09-20; (2018) Dataquest: Learn Data Science with Python and R Projects, , https://www.dataquest.io/, Accessed: 2018-09-20; (2018) Ggplot2 Is A System for Declaratively Creating Graphics, Based on the Grammar of Graphics, , https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/, Accessed: 2018-09-20; (2018) JupyterHub: A Multi-User Version of the Notebook Designed for Companies, Classrooms and Research Labs, , http://jupyter.org/hub, Accessed: 2018-09-20; (2018) R Markdown: Analyze.

Although some standalone programs in Data Science have been established around the country, many institutions encounter the challenges in balancing the curricula among different disciplines, allocating new resources, and cooperating with the existing majors regarding enrollment management, student advising, and faculty preparation. In this paper, a strategy-based framework is proposed for those who have limited resources of all kinds to introduce Data Science through their existing Computer Science programs at a baccalaureate level with a minimum curriculum disruption. Instead of a standalone program, to embed Data Science into Computer Science education is demonstrated to be a practical, effective, cost-saving approach based on an extensive study of the synergy between Data Science and Computer Science education. While the proposed framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach, it provides a doable route for blending Data Science into Computer Science education in systematic ways. It has become the consensus that an adequate exposure to Data Science will better prepare computer science students for taking the challenges in this ever-changing, data embraced world. © 2019 IEEE.","Computer Science Education; Curriculum Design; Data Science Education","Blending; Curricula; Data Science; Education computing; Engineering education; Students; Computer Science Education; Computer science programs; Computer science students; Cost saving; Curriculum designs; Enrollment management; Library science; Science education; Information management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Berman, F., Rutenbar, R., Hailpern, B., Christensen, H., Davidson, S., Estrin, D., Franklin, M., Szalay, A.S., Realizing the potential of data science (2018) The Communications of the ACM, 61 (4), pp. 67-72. , April; Burtch, L., (2018) The Burtch Works Study: Salaries of Data Scientists, , https://www.burtchworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DS-2017-Salary-Growth.pdf, May 2017, last accessed on Aug. 17; Cao, L., Data science: A comprehensive overview (2017) The ACM Computing Surveys, 50 (3), pp. 431-4342. , Article 43, Publication Date: June; Carson, C., Culler, D., Jacobsen, B., (2018) Berkeley's Undergraduate Data Science Curriculum: Year 1 Pedagogical Overview, , http://data.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/dsepsummaryreportyear1.pdf, University of California, Berkeley, Nov. 2016, last accessed on Aug. 17; De Veaux, R.D., Agarwal, M., Averett, M., Baumer, B.S., Bray, A., Bressoud, T.C., Bryant, L., Ye, P., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science (2017) The Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 21-216; Demchenko, Y., Belloum, A., Wiktorski, T., (2018) EDISON Data Science Framework: Part 1.

Modern data driven research and industry require new types of specialists that are capable to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. The education and training of Data Scientists requires multi-disciplinary approach combining wide view of the Data Science and Analytics foundation with deep practical knowledge in domain specific areas. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple form, also providing sufficient data labs facilities for practical training.

Hence, it is necessary to design efficient education techniques to rapidly train the next generation of students. We describe a holistic approach that integrates multiple objectives within a single semester course taught at the first year level. The objectives include basic data processing techniques, statistical analysis, teamwork, and project management. We conducted a project that combined different public datasets related to the cost and quality of education in the US. Students demonstrated a high degree of involvement in this exercise as they were curious to explore data that related to their own college selection process. It is well known that it is difficult to perform a cost-quality analysis in the field of college education.We used college ranking data created by the Wall Street Journal, and combined it with data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System database (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) that provided college costs and graduation data. Students worked in teams to download sections of the data from multiple sources, performed cleaning and verification, and merged the data for analysis. This taught them the values of teamwork, goal-setting, and process measurement for timely project completion.We determined that the Pearson correlation between the rank of a college and in-state tuition was-0.65 (p<0.005) for private colleges, and-0.34 (p<0.005) for public colleges. This indicates that higher ranked colleges tend to charge higher tuition. The Pearson correlation between the rank of all colleges and their graduation rates is-0.75 (p<0.005), and between rank and retention rates is-0.71 (p<0.005). Private college tuition is typically $40,000 annually, whereas public colleges cost $20,000. These figures suggest that public colleges provide good value. This has policy implications for government funding of education. © 2019 IEEE.","curricular development; data science; project management; statistical analysis","Correlation methods; Cost benefit analysis;

The power of evidence-based, inductive reasoning distinguishes data science from science. Hence, this chapter argues that, in its initial stages, data science applications and the data science discipline itself be developed inductively and deductively in a virtuous cycle. The virtues of the twentieth Century Virtuous Cycle (aka virtuous hardwaresoftware cycle, Intel-Microsoft virtuous cycle) that built the personal computer industry (National Research Council, The new global ecosystem in advanced computing: Implications for U.S. competitiveness and national security. The National Academies Press, Washington, DC, 2012) were being grounded in reality and being self-perpetuating-more powerful hardware enabled more powerful software that required more powerful hardware, enabling yet more powerful software, and so forth. Being grounded in reality-solving genuine problems at scale-was critical to its success, as it will be for data science. While it lasted, it was self-perpetuating, due to a constant flow of innovation, and to benefitting all participants-producers, consumers, the industry, the economy, and society. It is a wonderful success story for twentieth Century applied science. Given the success of virtuous cycles in developing modern technology, virtuous cycles grounded in reality should be used to develop data science, driven by the wisdom of the sixteenth Century proverb, Necessity is the mother of invention. This chapter explores this hypothesis using the example of the evolution of database management systems over the last 40 years. For the application of data science to be successful and virtuous, it should be grounded in a cycle that encompasses industry (i.e., real problems), research, development, and delivery. This chapter proposes applying the principles and lessons of the virtuous cycle to the development of data science applications; to the development of the data science discipline itself, for example, a data science method; and to the development of data science education; all focusing on the critical role of collaboration in data science research and management, thereby addressing the development challenges faced by the more than 150 Data Science Research Institutes (DSRIs) worldwide. A companion chapter (Brodie, What is Data Science, in Braschler et al (Eds.), Applied data science - Lessons learned for the data-driven business, Springer 2019), addresses essential questions that DSRIs should answer in preparation for the developments proposed here: What is data science?

To realize the potential of big data in biomedicine, the National Institutes of Health launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative, funding several centers of excellence in biomedical data analysis and a Training Coordinating Center (TCC) tasked with facilitating online and in-person training of biomedical researchers in data science. A major initiative of the BD2K TCC is to automatically identify, describe, and organize data science training resources available on the Web and provide personalized training paths for users. In this paper, we describe the construction of ERuDIte, the Educational Resource Discovery Index for Data Science, and its release as linked data. ERuDIte contains over 11,000 training resources including courses, video tutorials, conference talks, and other materials. The metadata for these resources is described uniformly using Schema.org. We use machine learning techniques to tag each resource with concepts from the Data Science Education Ontology, which we developed to further describe resource content. Finally, we map references to people and organizations in learning resources to entities in DBpedia, DBLP, and ORCID, embedding our collection in the web of linked data. We hope that ERuDIte will provide a framework to foster open linked educational resources on the Web. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

However, there are many challenges to providing education on data science in Library and Information Science schools. For example, developing curricula and models for managing faculty resources (full-time teaching, buy-out, or specialized faculty) are some initial, common challenges. Participants will present their experiences and insights regarding data science education, which may include curricula, barriers, and best practices in the panel presentations. The panel session then will open up to an active discussion session with the audience, who will be encouraged to share their experiences and insights. This panel session is part of an ongoing effort by the organizers to establish sustainable data science education in Information Science schools. Developing a framework and curricula of data science education in Information Science schools, based on best practices and informed by experience, is the optimal goal of this ongoing effort. The success of this effort depends on active participation of the participants. This panel is sponsored by SIG ED.

The curriculum design transforms human-centered principles into practice. The poster visually illustrates the trajectory of these principles in relation to three specific graduate attributes, using a selection of deep dives into the learning design. To illustrate the specific power information theory and practice has to shape data science training, the poster uses evocative quotes from information science theorists and displays how their work significantly influenced the overall philosophy of the program, student activities and assessments.

Through interaction analysis of video data, we identified ten data wrangling practices and developed a conceptual model of the data wrangling process that contains four interrelated recursive stages. These data wrangling practices and the process of data wrangling are important to understand for supporting future data science education opportunities that facilitate learning and discussion about scientific and socioeconomic issues. This study also sheds light on how the family migration modeling context positioned the youth as having agency and authority over big data. © ISLS.","Data science education; Data wrangling; Family migration; Modeling; Storytelling","E-learning; Large dataset; Models; Visualization; Data technologies; Data visualization tools; Data wrangling; Family migration; Interaction analysis; Science education; Storytelling; Visualization technologies; Data visualization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Azevedo, F.S., Mann, M.J., Seeing in the dark: Embodied cognition in amateur astronomy practice (2018) Journal of the Learning Sciences, 27 (1), pp. 89-136; Bandura, A., (1986) Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social-Cognitive View, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Borner, K., Peppler, K., Kennedy, B., Uzzo, S., Heimlich, J., Data Visualization Literacy: Research and Tools That Advance Public Understanding of Scientific Data (2017) Nsf-National Science Foundation, , https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1713567; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Engel, J., Statistical literacy for active citizenship: A call for data science education (2017) Statistics Education Research Journal, 16 (1), pp. 44-49; Enyedy, N., Mukhopadhyay, S., They don’t show nothing I didn’t know: Emergent tensions between culturally relevant pedagogy and mathematics pedagogy (2007) The Journal of the Learning Sciences, 16 (2), pp. 139-174; Fivush, R., Bohanek, J.G., Zaman, W., Personal and intergenerational narratives in relation to adolescents’ well‐being (2011) New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 2011 (131), pp. 45-57; Gibson, J.J., (1986) The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception, , Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum; Glaser, B.G., The constant comparative method of qualitative analysis (1965) Social Problems, 12 (4), pp. 436-445; Greeno, J.G., Gibson’s affordances (1994) Psychological Review, 101, pp. 336-342; Greeno, J.G., Engeström, Y., Learning in activity (2014) The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences, pp. 128-147. , In K.

The rubrics as a power but hardly formalizable evaluation method in application to digital media artefacts are also discussed. Moreover, the paper documents the experience of rubrics creation according to the suggested framework. The rubrics were successfully adopted to two data-driven journalism courses.

Thus, researchers have suggested the urgency for universities to review their curricular as the world is heading towards data era. The aim of this research was to analyze the current skill-gaps needs from stakeholders and opportunities to establish data science postgraduate programme that reflects the current technological trends and market demands at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM). A questionnaire was administered to 85 identified organizations to solicit information on the needs for data scientists and existing skill gaps. A total of 61 filled questionnaires response were received out of the 85 that were administered to selected organizations indicating a turn out rate of over 70%. Overall the analyzed data articulated a compelling evidence for the local industry growing need for data scientist. The survey that was conducted was followed up by conduct of various workshops and meetings to solicit inputs from different experts and stakeholders on different versions of the developed curriculum. Finally, a new programme in MSc in data Science was approved and established from April 2018 at UDSM. Despite its late approval and without formal advertisement on the public media, the programme attracted a large number of applicants for 2018/19 academic year, compared to other several postgraduate programmes in ICT offered at UDSM. &#x00A9; 2019, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Data science; Data science education; Data scientists; ICT; Skills-gap; UDSM","Commerce; Developing countries; Social aspects; Surveys; Current demands; Data scientists; International Federation for Information Processing; Postgraduate education; Science education; Skills gaps; Technological trends; UDSM; Data Science",,,,,"University of Dar es Salaam","South African educational institutions stands by far as African leading institutions in provision of different forms of data science education including the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) South Africa [11] which offers two months intensive data science training and the University of Witwatersrand [12], offering a one year degree program in Big data Analytics. Tanzania has not been left behind, in this dynamics as there has been a few initiatives that aim to strengthen data use and data driven innovation although largely funded through international donor programs. As part of open government partnership (OGP) membership the country implemented a basic statistics public data portal, and received data capacity building support through the World Bank and other international donor agencies [13]. The basic statistics portal [14] was established to provide data in a machine readable format to be used and reused by anybody. The data provided apply only to data and information produced or commissioned by government especially the prioritized sectors of Education, Water and Health. The most recent notable program for strengthening country data capacity is the Tanzania Data Lab project (dLab) [15] that started in April 2016 to June 2018 that sought to promote greater data use in the country through fostering data availability and data literacy. The dLab project was led by the UDSM through PEPFAR/MCC funding, and one key outcome from the project has been the motivation to expand data literacy through mainstreaming the data science education in higher learning institutions.",,,,,,,,,,"Manyika, J., (2011) Big Data: The Next Frontier for Innovation, Competition, and Productivity; Becker, T., Curry, E., Jentzsch, A., Palmetshofer, W., (2016) New Horizons for a Data-Driven Economy: Roadmaps and Action Plans for Technology, Businesses, Policy, and Society, pp. 277-291. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-21569-3_16, In: Cavanillas, J.M., Curry, E., Wahlster, W.

The adoption of DL in hydrology has so far been gradual, but the field is now ripe for breakthroughs. This paper suggests that DL-based methods can open up a complementary avenue toward knowledge discovery in hydrologic sciences. In the new avenue, machine-learning algorithms present competing hypotheses that are consistent with data. Interrogative methods are then invoked to interpret DL models for scientists to further evaluate. However, hydrology presents many challenges for DL methods, such as data limitations, heterogeneity and co-evolution, and the general inexperience of the hydrologic field with DL. The roadmap toward DL-powered scientific advances will require the coordinated effort from a large community involving scientists and citizens. Integrating process-based models with DL models will help alleviate data limitations. The sharing of data and baseline models will improve the efficiency of the community as a whole. Open competitions could serve as the organizing events to greatly propel growth and nurture data science education in hydrology, which demands a grassroots collaboration. The area of hydrologic DL presents numerous research opportunities that could, in turn, stimulate advances in machine learning as well. © 2018 Author(s).",,"Artificial intelligence; Hydrology; Learning algorithms; Data limitations; Hydrologic science; Industry applications; Integrating process; Research opportunities; Science education; Scientific advances; Scientific discovery; Deep learning; algorithm; applied science; education; heterogeneity; hydrology; knowledge; machine learning; technology adoption",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 403047, EAR-1338606, EAR-1832294; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE: DE-SC0016605; Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province, SPDST: 2018SZ0343; Sichuan University, SCU: CCF-1317560; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics","Acknowledgements.

In this paper, we present, 'Milo', a web-based visual programming environment for Data Science Education, designed as a pedagogical tool that can be used by students without prior-programming experience. To that end, Milo uses graphical blocks as abstractions of language specific implementations of Data Science and Machine Learning(ML) concepts along with creation of interactive visualizations. Using block definitions created by a user, Milo generates equivalent source code in JavaScript to run entirely in the browser. Based on a preliminary user study with a focus group of undergraduate computer science students, Milo succeeds as an effective tool for novice learners in the field of Data Science. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Learning systems; Students; Visualization; Computer science students; Equivalent source; Graphical blocks; Interactive visualizations; Pedagogical tools; Programming experience; Science education; Visual programming environments; Visual languages",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2017) Linkedin's 2017 U.s.

This has led to a number of opinion pieces advocating for an update to the Statistics curriculum. The unifying recommendation is that computing should play a more prominent role. We strongly agree with this recommendation, but advocate the main priority is to bring applications to the forefront as proposed by Nolan and Speed in 1999. We also argue that the individuals tasked with developing data science courses should not only have statistical training, but also have experience analyzing data with the main objective of solving real-world problems. Here, we share a set of general principles and offer a detailed guide derived from our successful experience developing and teaching a graduate-level, introductory data science course centered entirely on case studies. We argue for the importance of statistical thinking, as defined by Wild and Pfannkuch in 1999 and describe how our approach teaches students three key skills needed to succeed in data science, which we refer to as creating, connecting, and computing. This guide can also be used for statisticians wanting to gain more practical knowledge about data science before embarking on teaching an introductory course.

Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers. Based on our results, we conclude that hack weeks present an effective, easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to positively impact data analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster collaboration, and cultivate best practices. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

The growing field of data science has the potential to address many of these needs, primarily due to recent efforts to collect large amounts of data related to social, environmental, and political issues. A challenge is that there exists a disconnect between these real-world issues and the course materials taught to university students. This gap is due in part to a lack of engagement between universities and their local communities, leaving students with few opportunities to work with datasets relevant to real-world problems. To address this disconnect, the authors have implemented a novel data science education and outreach program in which students acquire new knowledge and skills while creating positive social impact through community service. In this work, we outline this outreach program, the Michigan Data Science Team, and provide empirical evidence of positive educational and social impact. © 2018 IEEE.","Collaborative Learning; Data Science Education; Service-Learning; Social Impact","Economic and social effects; Collaborative learning; Community services; Large amounts of data; Real-world problem; Science education; Service learning; Social impact; University students; Students",,,,,"Horace H.

It is essential they learn by working on assignments that involve real world data sets to develop the skills needed to be successful in the workplace. However, enabling instructors to flexibly deliver all kinds of data science assignments using real world data sets to large numbers of learners (both on-campus and off-campus) at low cost is a significant open challenge. To address this emerging challenge generally, we develop and deploy a novel Cloud-based Lab for Data Science (CLaDS) to enable many learners around the world to work on real-world data science problems without having to move or otherwise distribute prohibitively large data sets. Leveraging version control and continuous integration, CLaDS provides a general infrastructure to enable any instructor to conveniently deliver any hands-on data science assignment that uses large real world data sets to as many learners as our cloud-computing infrastructure allows at very low cost. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CLaDS and discuss our experience with using CLaDS to deploy seven major text data assignments for students in both an on-campus course and an online course to work on for learning about text data retrieval and mining techniques; this shows that CLaDS is a very promising novel general infrastructure for efficiently delivering a wide range of hands-on data science assignments to a large number of learners at very low cost. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Cloud computing; Data science education; Virtual lab","Cloud computing; Costs; Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Engineering education; Engineering research; Virtual reality; Cloud computing infrastructures; Continuous integrations; Design and implementations; Mining techniques; Science education; Scientists and engineers; Version control; Virtual lab; Big data",,,,,"Gulf Research Program: IIS-1629161; National Science Foundation, NSF: DGE-1144245","This material is based upon work supported by the NSF GRFP under Grant Number DGE-1144245, by the NSF Research Program under Grant Number IIS-1629161, by Microsoft Azure, and by a gift fund from Intel under its support program for Big Data Education.",,,,,,,,,,"Beck, K., (2000) Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, , Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA; Eisenstein, J., O’Connor, B., Smith, N.A., Xing, E.P., A latent variable model for geographic lexical variation (2010) Proc.

Scientists, engineers, and executives routinely encounter enormous volumes of data, and new techniques and tools are emerging to create knowledge out of these data, some of them capable of working with real-time streams of data. The nation's ability to make use of these data depends on the availability of an educated workforce with necessary expertise. With these new capabilities have come novel ethical challenges regarding the effectiveness and appropriateness of broad applications of data analyses. The field of data science has emerged to address the proliferation of data and the need to manage and understand it. Data science is a hybrid of multiple disciplines and skill sets, draws on diverse fields (including computer science, statistics, and mathematics), encompasses topics in ethics and privacy, and depends on specifics of the domains to which it is applied. Fueled by the explosion of data, jobs that involve data science have proliferated and an array of data science programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels have been established. Nevertheless, data science is still in its infancy, which suggests the importance of envisioning what the field might look like in the future and what key steps can be taken now to move data science education in that direction. This study will set forth a vision for the emerging discipline of data science at the undergraduate level. This interim report lays out some of the information and comments that the committee has gathered and heard during the first half of its study, offers perspectives on the current state of data science education, and poses some questions that may shape the way data science education evolves in the future. The study will conclude in early 2018 with a final report that lays out a vision for future data science education. © 2018 by the National Academy of Sciences.

In this paper, we describe the use of qualitative and quantitative methods to study data science projects completed by undergraduate students who are learning data science but have already learned computer programming. The projects are stored as Jupyter notebooks: documents that store code, as well as its output from execution, formatted text for self-explanations, and graphics. Our analysis of the notebooks discovers two kinds of student attitudes: explorers, who work iteratively, and goal accomplishers, who work incrementally. Despite varying attitudes, we find that students often fluctuate between the two learner types depending on their computational goals for a given notebook. Moreover, when students practice the explorer approach, they often engage more actively with many CT skills such as pattern generalization and communication of results. Finally, we propose ways to utilize these findings to encourage CT practices in future data science curricula. © 2018, The Education University of Hong Kong.

Methods and Materials: The features of two online data science platforms are outlined. Both are useful for new data projects and both are integrated with common programming languages used for data analysis. One platform focuses more on data exploration and the other focuses on containerizing, visualization, and sharing code repositories. Results: Both data science platforms are open, free, and allow for collaboration. Both are capable of visual, descriptive, and predictive analytics Discussion: Data science education benefits by having affordable open and collaborative platforms to conduct a variety of data analyses. Conclusion: Open collaborative data science platforms are particularly useful for teaching data science skills to clinical and nonclinical informatics students. Commercial data science platforms exist but are cost-prohibitive and generally limited to specific programming languages. © The Author(s) 2018.

This is due to several good reasons. Probably an important one of those reasons is the growing demand to find proper ways to face the challenges of establishing data-driven economies and societies. As academics and educationalists, but also Data Science professionals, we look at how to bring up this kind of specialists such that to meet the current shortages but also mid-term demands. In this position paper we deliberate about how to architect thematically, didactically, and organizationally a university program under the thematic umbrella of Data Science. We focus on the selection of learning units or disciplines to be covered in order to produce the M.Sci. and Ph.D. graduates who will be ready to face the future challenges in the mid-term perspective. We outline our recommendation on using learning tools and materials. We also concisely present the approach for stimulating competitive and cooperative atmosphere in the class that stimulates intensive collective and individual learning. We recommend to reinforce an academic program by involving industrial partners intensively in the process. We ground our deliberation on our experience in implementing relevant M.Sci. and Ph.D. programs in Data Science and Semantic Technologies. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Collaboration with industries; Data science education; Didactics; Learning tools; Program structure; Topical scope","Knowledge management; Semantics; Collaboration with industries; Didactics; Learning tool; Program structures; Science education; Topical scope; Industrial research",,,,,"PIRSES-GA-2013-612551; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","This work has been done in cooperation between the authors which has been kicked off in the EU FP7 SemData project funded by Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme, grant agreement No PIRSES-GA-2013-612551.

However, as the amount of available data continues to increase, so does the demand for professionals who have the necessary skills to manage and manipulate this data. This paper presents the European Data Science Academy (EDSA), an initiative for bridging the data science skills gap across Europe and training a new generation of world-leading data scientists. The EDSA project has established a rigorous process and a set of best practices for the production and delivery of curricula for data science. Additionally, the project’s efforts are dedicated to linking the demand for data science skills with the supply of learning resources that offer these skills. In order to achieve this, EDSA is offering interactive tools for finding learning resources and building personalised learning pathways towards acquiring the skills that are currently in demand. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Courseware; Curricula; Data science; Demand analysis; Personalised learning pathways; Skills","Curricula; E-learning; Teaching; Courseware; Data science; Demand analysis; Personalised learning; Skills; Personnel training",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Horizon 2020: 643937","EDSA is a research project funded by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union, Grant Agreement no. 643937.","Acknowledgement.

Modern data driven research and industry require new types of specialists that are capable to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. The education and training of Data Scientists currently lacks a commonly accepted, harmonized instructional model that reflects all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science practitioners in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. The educational model and approach should also solve different aspects of the future professionals that includes both theoretical knowledge and practical skills that must be supported by corresponding education infrastructure and educational labs environment. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple form, also providing sufficient data labs facilities for practical training. This paper discussed both aspects: building customizable Data Science curriculum for different types of learners and proposing a hybrid model for virtual labs that can combine local university facility and use cloud based Big Data and Data analytics facilities and services on demand. The proposed approach is based on using the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) developed in the EU funded Project EDISON and CYCLONE cloud automation systems being developed in another EU funded project CYCLONE. © 2017 IEEE.","Big Data; CYC; Data Science; Data Science Body of Knowledge; Data Science Competences Framework; Data Science Model Curriculum; Data Scientist Professional; EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF); FAIR principles in Open Education; Virtual Data Labs (VDLabs)","Automation; Cloud computing; Curricula; Data handling; Distance education; E-learning; Industrial research; Laboratories; Life cycle; Storms; Body of knowledge; Data Science; Data Science Competences Framework; Data Scientist Professional; EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF); Model curriculum; Open educations; Virtual data; Big data",,,,,"European Commission, EC: 644925","The research leading to these results has received funding from the Horizon2020 projects CYCLONE (funded by the European Commission under grant number 644925) and EDISON (funded under grant n. 675419.",,,,,,,,,,"http://edison-project.eu/edison/edison-data-scienceframework-edsf, EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF); http://edison-project.eu/data-science-competence-frameworkcf-ds, Data Science Competence Framework; http://edisonproject.eu/data-science-body-knowledge-ds-bok, Data Science Body of Knowledge; http://edisonproject.eu/data-science-model-curriculum-mc-ds, Data Science Model Curriculum; http://edisonproject.eu/data-science-professional-profiles, Data Science Professional Profiles; Yuri, D., Bernstein, D., Belloum, A., Oprescu, A., Tomasz, W., Wlodarczyk cees de laat new instructional models for building effective curricula on cloud computing technologies and engineering (2013) Proc.

Need for computing platforms that are well-equip with the appropriate tools for students and instructors, and that are readily accessible and flexibly configurable has subsequently become more conspicuous. Using lots of sandboxes that would consume tremendous resources is not an effective solution. This paper propose a solution that design and implement Hadoop as a private online service that could effectively meet the design characteristics of an academic data science computing platform. The propose design emphasise a quick deployment solution based on available resources and technologies. The case study that follow demonstrate and cultivate our approach as a proof of concept for any academic institutions to implement their own services.

These new trends impact the society and future jobs, and thus student careers. At the heart of this digital transformation is data science, the discipline that makes sense of big data. With many rapidly emerging digital challenges ahead of us, this article discusses perspectives on iSchools' opportunities and suggestions in data science education. We argue that iSchools should empower their students with ""information computing""disciplines, which we define as the ability to solve problems and create values, information, and knowledge using tools in application domains. As specific approaches to enforcing information computing disciplines in data science education, we suggest the three foci of user-based, tool-based, and application-based. These three foci will serve to differentiate the data science education of iSchools from that of computer science or business schools. We present a layered Data Science Education Framework (DSEF) with building blocks that include the three pillars of data science (people, technology, and data), computational thinking, data-driven paradigms, and data science lifecycles. Data science courses built on the top of this framework should thus be executed with user-based, tool-based, and application-based approaches. This framework will help our students think about data science problems from the big picture perspective and foster appropriate problem-solving skills in conjunction with broad perspectives of data science lifecycles. We hope the DSEF discussed in this article will help fellow iSchools in their design of new data science curricula. © 2017 Il-Yeol Song & Yongjun Zhu.","Big data; Computational thinking; Data science; Data science lifecycle; Data-driven paradigm; Information computing; iSchool; The fourth Industrial Revolution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baweja, B., Donovan, P., Haefele, M., Siddiqi, L., Smiles, S., Extreme automation and connectivity: The global, regional, and investment implications of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (2016) UBS White Paper for the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2016, , https://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/follow_ubs/highlights/davos-2016.html, Retrieved on October, 1, 2016, from; Bundy, A., Computational thinking is pervasive (2007) Journal of Scientific and Practical Computing, 1 (2), pp. 67-69; Davenport, T.H., Patil, D.J., Data scientist: The sexiest job of the 21st century (2012) Harvard Business Review, 90 (10), pp. 70-76; Dhar, V., Data science and prediction (2013) Communications of the ACM, 56 (12), pp. 64-73; (2016) Organizing for Big Data Through Better Process and Governance., , https://www.gartner.com/doc/3002918?ref=SiteSearch&sthkw=citizen%20data%20scientist&fnl=search&srcId=1-3478922254, Retrieved on September 15, 2016, from; Kagermann, H., Helbig, J., Hellinger, A., Wahlster, W., (2013) Recommendations for Implementing the Strategic Initiative Industrie 4.0: Securing the Future of the German Manufacturing Industry; Final Report of the Industrie 4.0 Working Group., , http://www.manufacturing-policy.eng.cam.ac.uk/documents-folder/policies/germanyrecommendations-for-implementing-the-strategic-initiative-industrie-4-0-bmbf-aquatic/view, Retrieved on September 15, 2016, from; Lasi, H., Fettke, P., Kemper, H., Feld, T., Hoffmann, M., Industry 4.0 (2014) Business & Information Systems Engineering, 6 (4), pp. 239-242; Mayer-Schonberger, V., Cukier, K., (2013) Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think, , Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; Provost, F., Fawcett, T., Data science and its relationship to big data and data-driven decision making (2013) Big Data, 1 (1), pp. 51-59; Schwab, K., The fourth industrial revolution: What it means, how to respond (2016) World Economic Forum., , https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond, Retrieved on October 20, 2016, from; Stanton, J., (2012) An Introduction to Data Science., , http://ischool.syr.edu/media/documents/2012/3/datasciencebook1_1.pdf, Retrieved on September 15, 2016, from; Song, I.-Y., Zhu, Y., Big data and data science: What should we teach?

However, currently, data science educators lack good tools and methodologies. In particular, they lack integrated tools through which their students can acquire hands-on software engineering experience. To address these problems, we designed and implemented DataLab, a web-based tool for data science education that integrates code, data and execution management into one system. The goal of DataLab is to provide a hands-on online lab environment to train students to have basic software engineering thinking and habits while maintaining a focus on the core data science contents. In this paper, we present the user-experience design and system-level implementation of DataLab. Further, we evaluate DataLab's performance through an in-classroom use case. Finally, using objective log-based learning behavior analysis and a subjective survey, we demonstrate DataLab's effectiveness. © 2017 IEEE.","data science; software engineering","Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Information management; Students; data science; Execution management; Integrated tools; Learning behavior; Science education; System levels; User experience design; Web-based tools; Software engineering",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"White, T., (2012) Hadoop: The Definitive Guide[ M, , OReilly Media, Inc; Zaharia, M., Chowdhury, M., Das, T., Resilient distributed datasets: A fault-Tolerant abstraction for in-memory cluster computing[ c (2012) Proceedings of the 9th USENIX Conference on Networked Systems Design and Implementation, p. 2. , USENIX Association; Isard, M., Budiu, M., Yu, Y., Dryad: Distributed data-parallel programs from sequential building blocks[ c (2007) ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review.

The anecdotal evidence suggests this was a mistake: data scientists report spending most of their time grappling with data far upstream of modeling activities. A second wave of data science education is emerging, one with increased emphasis on practical issues in ethics, legal compliance, scientific reproducibility, data quality, and algorithmic bias. The data engineering community has a second chance to influence these programs beyond just providing a set of tools. In this panel, we'll discuss the role of data engineering in data science education programs, and how best to capitalize on emerging opportunities in this space. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Education; Anecdotal evidences; Data engineering; Legal compliance; Practical issues; Reproducibilities; Scalable algorithms; Science education; Statistical modeling; Information management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","IEEE Computer Society","33rd IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, ICDE 2017","19 April 2017 through 22 April 2017",,127836,10844627,9781509065431,,,"English","Proc Int Conf Data Eng",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021187717

This is the first phase of the Exploring Data Worlds at the Public Library research study research study, a two-year research study that explores the ways that libraries can address data literacy programming by helping teens understand, create and manage the digital traces of their data in meaningful, efficacious, and ethical ways. In this first phase of the study we explored the question What do young people understand about data within the context of their everyday lives and in relation to personal data management. We present here the findings from a series of semi-structured interviews with young people, ages 11 to 18, that examined teens' perceptions and general knowledge of data in their lives. Results suggest that the teens in this study had varying interpretations of the nature of data and a broad understanding of the lifecycle of data, but most found it difficult to connect with data at a concrete and personal level, with the notion of a personal data dossier either non-existent or abstract.

With elementary school age children as the target audience, we developed an educational collaborative game, Habitat Explorer for the MultiTaction display to introduce users to the core data science cycle components of data collection, exploration, and visualization. Users capture ""sea creatures"" in a collection jar, sort their collection into a data table, and then are able to create a bar chart visualization using their data. These components are interspersed with questions assessing user comprehension of the simple biological and data science concepts introduced during the game. The main goal of this research is to understand the potential of multi-touch displays to facilitate data science education with future aims to develop more complicated data exploration applications.

Data science is a new emerging discipline that was termed to address challenges that we are facing and going to face in the big data era. Thus, education in data science is the key to success, and we need concrete strategies and approaches to better educate future data scientists.

Data Science education programs are rapidly being created on all levels. Usually it happens through reuse or renaming and can result in curricula that lack proper balance of competences, which balance is necessary for future data scientists. Our quantitative analysis of over 300 programs worldwide shows that at least one of the three core data science competence groups is under-represented in the majority of programs. Moreover, general business courses are often suggested to students to cover the domain competence group, which in most cases results in superficial treatment of this competence group.

Herein, the authors introduce Multifaceted Rasch Measurement (MFRM) analysis and explain why MFRM must be used when ""judges'"" data are collected. The authors use data from elementary science methods students enrolled in a senior-level, semester-length course. Acting as judges, students used the 23-item Elementary Science Teaching Analysis Matrix (ESTAM) instrument to evaluate five separate science lessons taught by five different teachers. Our MFRM analysis documents that multiple judges need not act as identical robots. Rather, differences in judges' severity can be computed and corrections made in an analysis to take into consideration differing judge severity.

Consequently there is a need to increase the data literacy of computer science students. Data science is a rela-Tively new area within computer science and the curriculum is rapidly evolving along with the tools required to perform analytics which students need to learn how to effectively use. To address the needs of students learning key data science and analytics skills we propose augmenting existing data science curriculums with hackathon events that focus on data also known as datathons. In this paper we present our experience at hosting and running four datathons that involved students and members from the community coming together to solve challenging problems with data from not-for-profit social good organizations and publicly open data. Our reported experience from our datathons will help in-form other academics and community groups who also wish to host datathons to help facilitate their students and mem-bers to learn key data science and analytics skills. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The paper introduces and motivates the current situation in this application area as a basis for a corresponding problem statement that is utilized to derive goals and objectives of the approach. Furthermore, the relevant state-of-the-art is revisited and remaining challenges are identified. An exemplar set of use cases, corresponding user stereotypes as well as a conceptual design model to address these challenges are introduced. A corresponding architectural system model is suggested as a conceptual reference architecture to support proof-of-concept implementations as well as to support interoperability in distributed infrastructures.

Prominent research institutions and private sector industry have embraced data science, but foundations for effective tertiary-level data science education remain absent. This is nothing new, however, as the university has an established tradition of developing its educational mission hand-in-hand with the development of novel methods for human understanding (Feingold, 1991). Thus, it is natural that universities ""figure out"" data science concurrent with the development of needed pedagogy. We consider data science education with respect to recent trends in interdisciplinary and experiential educational methodologies. The first iteration of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) Collaborative, which took place at the University of California, Berkeley in the Spring of 2015, is used as a case study. From this, we draw lessons learned regarding the necessary components of effective tertiary data science education, which range from a complete end-to-end workflow, technological tools for development and team communications, and appropriate motivation and incentives. Our findings will be tested and revised in subsequent iterations of the BIDS Collaborative as we continue our study of data science education, research, and social impact. © 2016 by the authors.","Case study; Data science; Experiential learning; Tertiary education","Data visualization; Iterative methods; Data-driven applications; Educational methodologies; Experiential learning; Research institutions; Technological tools; Tertiary education; University of California , Berkeley; Visualization and analysis; Data Science",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baek, Y., Jung, J., Kim, B., What makes teachers use technology in the classroom?

It also provides an engaging context in which to learn computational thinking skills in existing classroom contexts. For my dissertation research, I will explore whether and how data science can support inquiry-based learning in social studies. I conjecture that data science could provide students with an opportunity to use computing to better understand their social world, while also allowing students to draw from and make sense of their own experiences. I plan to explore this idea by enhancing and evaluating a software tool, Local Ground, and creating a curriculum that helps young people identify and describe salient characteristics of their lived realities, moving from unstructured to structured data representations (e.g., photos to tags to databases). This process may generate a rich, motivating data source to explore subsequent ideas in computational thinking and social science.","Broadening participation; Computational thinking; Data science education; Interdisciplinary approaches","Curricula; Education; Social sciences; Broadening participation; Computational thinkings; Inquiry-based learning; Interdisciplinary approaches; Science education; Structured data; Support learning; Young peoples; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bort, H., Czarnik, M., Brylow, D., Introducing computing concepts to non-majors: A case study in gothic novels (2015) Proceedings of the 46th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE '15), pp. 132-137. , (2015); DiSalvo, B., Guzdail, M., Glitch game testers: African amencan men breaking open the console (2009) Digital Games Research Association Conference, pp. 1-7. , (2009); Edelson, D.C., Gordin, D.N., Pea, R.D., Addressing the challenges of inquiry-based learning through technology and curriculum design (1999) Journal of the Learning Sciences, 8 (3-4), pp. 391-450. , (1999); Goode, J., Margolis, J., Exploring computer science (2011) ACM Transactions on Computing Education, 11 (2), pp. 1-16. , (2011); Gutiérrez, K.D., Vossoughi, S., Lifting off the ground to return anew: Mediated praxis, transformative learning, and social design experiments (2010) Journal of Teacher Education, 61, pp. 100-117. , (2010); Lee, C., (2007) Culture Literacy and Learning, , Teachers' College Press; Philip, T.M., Way, W., Garcia, A.D., Schuler-Brown, S., Navarro, O., When educators attempt to make ""community"" a part of classroom learning: Thedangers of (mis) appropriating students' communities into schools (2013) Teaching and Teacher Education, 34, pp. 174-183. , (2013); Plaue, C., Cook, L.R., Data journalism: Lessons learned while designing an interdisciplinary service course (2015) Proceedings of the 46th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE '15), pp. 126-131. , (2015); Van Wart, S., Tsai, K.J., Parikh, T., Local ground: A paper-based toolkit for documenting local geo-spatial knowledge (2010) Proceedings of the First ACM Symposium on Computing for Development, p. 1. , (2010)","Van Wart, S.; UC Berkeley, United States; email: vanwars@berkeley.edu",,"ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE)","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","11th Annual ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research, ICER 2015","9 August 2015 through 13 August 2015",,117931,,9781450336284,,,"English","ICER - Proc.

The project focuses on advanced data analytics (ADA) in business management. In the project, advanced data analytics is taught to both students at University of Eastern Finland and to their potential employers at the local organizations. The university teaching favors effective teaching techniques instead of conventional teaching methods, and the same topics are taught to participants from local organizations as shorter versions. The organizations also have an important role in calibrating the teaching via discussions and maturity reviews. Even-though the project is regional there has been great nationwide interest in the project. This indicates the general need for improving know-how on ADA both at universities and in companies and organizations.

Although some conceptions of data science focus primarily on analytical methods, data scientists must also have a deep understanding of how project data were collected, preprocessed and transformed. These processes strongly influence the analytical methods that can be applied, and more importantly how the results of those methods should be interpreted. In the present chapter we provide background information on educational challenges for data scientists and report on the results of a workshop where experts from the information field brainstormed on the educational dimensions of data science. Results of the workshop showed that data scientists must possess a breadth of expertise across three areas - curation, analytics, and cyber-infrastructure - with deep knowledge in at least one of these areas. Workshop participants also underscored the importance of domain knowledge to the success of the data science role. Additionally, the workshop highlighted a factor that differentiates data science from other professional specialties: the emphasis on serving the data needs of information users and decision makers. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Data visualization; Information management; Information services; Background information; Cyber infrastructures; Educational challenge; Heterogeneous data; Information professionals; Information users; Science education; Workshop participants; Metadata",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allard, S., Levine, K.J., Tenopir, C., Design engineers and technical professionals at work: Observing information usage in the workplace (2009) J.
