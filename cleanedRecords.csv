DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS FIELD AND HIGH DEMAND, KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE TO STEM STUDENTS IS SCARCE. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE ROLE OF DATA SCIENCE AND ANALYTICS EDUCATION TO IMPROVE THE STUDENTS' COMPUTING AND ANALYTICAL SKILLS ACROSS A RANGE OF DOMAIN-SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. THE PAPER STUDIES FOUR EXAMPLES OF DATA-INTENSIVE STEM PROJECTS FOR SUPERVISED UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES (SURE) IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE, QUANTUM PHYSICS, AND CYBERSECURITY. THE DEVELOPED PROJECTS INCLUDE THE APPLICATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE FOR IMPROVING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING, AUTOMATING MICROSCOPY IMAGES ANALYSIS, IDENTIFYING THE QUANTUM OPTICAL MODES, AND DETECTING NETWORK INTRUSION. THE PAPER AIMS TO PROVIDE SOME GUIDELINES TO EFFECTIVELY EDUCATE THE NEXT GENERATION OF STEM UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS AND PREPARE STEM PROFESSIONALS WITH INTERDISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND COMPETENCIES IN DATA SCIENCE. THE PAPER INCLUDES A SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES AND OUTCOMES FROM OUR RESEARCH AND EDUCATION IN THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING. WE WILL EVALUATE THE STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES IN SOLVING BIG DATA INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECTS TO CONFRONT THE NEW CHALLENGES IN A COMPUTATIONALLY-DRIVEN WORLD. © AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR ENGINEERING EDUCATION, 2022",AND ANALYTICAL SKILLS; COMPUTING; DATA SCIENCE; SUPERVISED UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES,BIG DATA; DATA SCIENCE; ENGINEERING EDUCATION; IMAGE ENHANCEMENT; LEARNING SYSTEMS; ANALYTICAL SKILLS; AND ANALYTICAL SKILL; COMPUTING; ENGINEERING DISCIPLINES; RESEARCH EXPERIENCE; SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING; SCIENCE DISCIPLINES; SCIENCE EDUCATION; SUPERVISED UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE; UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH; STUDENTS,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF: 2011900",THIS WORK WAS FUNDED BY THE NSF HBCU-UP PROJECT (NSF AWARD # 2011900): TARGETED INFUSION PROJECT: SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY ± COMPUTING AND DATA EDUCATION (SU-CODE).,"LANGDON, D., MCKITTRICK, G., BEEDE, D., KHAN, B., DOMS, M., (2011) STEM: GOOD JOBS NOW AND FOR THE FUTURE.

IN THIS PAPER, WE EXAMINE THE SOCIOTECHNICAL PRACTICES OF DATA WRANGLING—STRATEGIES FOR SELECTING AND MANAGING DATASETS TO PRODUCE A MODEL AND STORY IN A BIG DATA INTERFACE—FOR YOUTH ASSEMBLING MODELS AND STORIES ABOUT FAMILY MIGRATION USING INTERACTIVE DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS. THROUGH INTERACTION ANALYSIS OF VIDEO DATA, WE IDENTIFIED TEN DATA WRANGLING PRACTICES AND DEVELOPED A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF THE DATA WRANGLING PROCESS THAT CONTAINS FOUR INTERRELATED RECURSIVE STAGES. THESE DATA WRANGLING PRACTICES AND THE PROCESS OF DATA WRANGLING ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND FOR SUPPORTING FUTURE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES THAT FACILITATE LEARNING AND DISCUSSION ABOUT SCIENTIFIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC ISSUES. THIS STUDY ALSO SHEDS LIGHT ON HOW THE FAMILY MIGRATION MODELING CONTEXT POSITIONED THE YOUTH AS HAVING AGENCY AND AUTHORITY OVER BIG DATA. © ISLS.",DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; DATA WRANGLING; FAMILY MIGRATION; MODELING; STORYTELLING,E-LEARNING; LARGE DATASET; MODELS; VISUALIZATION; DATA TECHNOLOGIES; DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS; DATA WRANGLING; FAMILY MIGRATION; INTERACTION ANALYSIS; SCIENCE EDUCATION; STORYTELLING; VISUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES; DATA VISUALIZATION,,,"AZEVEDO, F.S., MANN, M.J., SEEING IN THE DARK: EMBODIED COGNITION IN AMATEUR ASTRONOMY PRACTICE (2018) JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES, 27 (1), PP. 89-136; BANDURA, A., (1986) SOCIAL FOUNDATIONS OF THOUGHT AND ACTION: A SOCIAL-COGNITIVE VIEW, , ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, NJ: PRENTICE-HALL; BORNER, K., PEPPLER, K., KENNEDY, B., UZZO, S., HEIMLICH, J., DATA VISUALIZATION LITERACY: RESEARCH AND TOOLS THAT ADVANCE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENTIFIC DATA (2017) NSF-NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, , HTTPS://WWW.NSF.GOV/AWARDSEARCH/SHOWAWARD?AWD_ID=1713567; BOYD, D., CRAWFORD, K., CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR BIG DATA: PROVOCATIONS FOR A CULTURAL, TECHNOLOGICAL, AND SCHOLARLY PHENOMENON (2012) INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY, 15 (5), PP. 662-679; ENGEL, J., STATISTICAL LITERACY FOR ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP: A CALL FOR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION (2017) STATISTICS EDUCATION RESEARCH JOURNAL, 16 (1), PP. 44-49; ENYEDY, N., MUKHOPADHYAY, S., THEY DON’T SHOW NOTHING I DIDN’T KNOW: EMERGENT TENSIONS BETWEEN CULTURALLY RELEVANT PEDAGOGY AND MATHEMATICS PEDAGOGY (2007) THE JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES, 16 (2), PP. 139-174; FIVUSH, R., BOHANEK, J.G., ZAMAN, W., PERSONAL AND INTERGENERATIONAL NARRATIVES IN RELATION TO ADOLESCENTS’ WELL‐BEING (2011) NEW DIRECTIONS FOR CHILD AND ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT, 2011 (131), PP. 45-57; GIBSON, J.J., (1986) THE ECOLOGICAL APPROACH TO VISUAL PERCEPTION, , HILLSDALE, NJ: ERLBAUM; GLASER, B.G., THE CONSTANT COMPARATIVE METHOD OF QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS (1965) SOCIAL PROBLEMS, 12 (4), PP. 436-445; GREENO, J.G., GIBSON’S AFFORDANCES (1994) PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW, 101, PP. 336-342; GREENO, J.G., ENGESTRÖM, Y., LEARNING IN ACTIVITY (2014) THE CAMBRIDGE HANDBOOK OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES, PP. 128-147. , IN K.

SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, AND EXECUTIVES ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER ENORMOUS VOLUMES OF DATA, AND NEW TECHNIQUES AND TOOLS ARE EMERGING TO CREATE KNOWLEDGE OUT OF THESE DATA, SOME OF THEM CAPABLE OF WORKING WITH REAL-TIME STREAMS OF DATA. THE NATION'S ABILITY TO MAKE USE OF THESE DATA DEPENDS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF AN EDUCATED WORKFORCE WITH NECESSARY EXPERTISE. WITH THESE NEW CAPABILITIES HAVE COME NOVEL ETHICAL CHALLENGES REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND APPROPRIATENESS OF BROAD APPLICATIONS OF DATA ANALYSES. THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE HAS EMERGED TO ADDRESS THE PROLIFERATION OF DATA AND THE NEED TO MANAGE AND UNDERSTAND IT. DATA SCIENCE IS A HYBRID OF MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES AND SKILL SETS, DRAWS ON DIVERSE FIELDS (INCLUDING COMPUTER SCIENCE, STATISTICS, AND MATHEMATICS), ENCOMPASSES TOPICS IN ETHICS AND PRIVACY, AND DEPENDS ON SPECIFICS OF THE DOMAINS TO WHICH IT IS APPLIED. FUELED BY THE EXPLOSION OF DATA, JOBS THAT INVOLVE DATA SCIENCE HAVE PROLIFERATED AND AN ARRAY OF DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS AT THE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE LEVELS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED. NEVERTHELESS, DATA SCIENCE IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY, WHICH SUGGESTS THE IMPORTANCE OF ENVISIONING WHAT THE FIELD MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE AND WHAT KEY STEPS CAN BE TAKEN NOW TO MOVE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IN THAT DIRECTION. THIS STUDY WILL SET FORTH A VISION FOR THE EMERGING DISCIPLINE OF DATA SCIENCE AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL. THIS INTERIM REPORT LAYS OUT SOME OF THE INFORMATION AND COMMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS GATHERED AND HEARD DURING THE FIRST HALF OF ITS STUDY, OFFERS PERSPECTIVES ON THE CURRENT STATE OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, AND POSES SOME QUESTIONS THAT MAY SHAPE THE WAY DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION EVOLVES IN THE FUTURE. THE STUDY WILL CONCLUDE IN EARLY 2018 WITH A FINAL REPORT THAT LAYS OUT A VISION FOR FUTURE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. © 2018 BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.

THE PROJECTS ARE STORED AS JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS: DOCUMENTS THAT STORE CODE, AS WELL AS ITS OUTPUT FROM EXECUTION, FORMATTED TEXT FOR SELF-EXPLANATIONS, AND GRAPHICS. OUR ANALYSIS OF THE NOTEBOOKS DISCOVERS TWO KINDS OF STUDENT ATTITUDES: EXPLORERS, WHO WORK ITERATIVELY, AND GOAL ACCOMPLISHERS, WHO WORK INCREMENTALLY. DESPITE VARYING ATTITUDES, WE FIND THAT STUDENTS OFTEN FLUCTUATE BETWEEN THE TWO LEARNER TYPES DEPENDING ON THEIR COMPUTATIONAL GOALS FOR A GIVEN NOTEBOOK. MOREOVER, WHEN STUDENTS PRACTICE THE EXPLORER APPROACH, THEY OFTEN ENGAGE MORE ACTIVELY WITH MANY CT SKILLS SUCH AS PATTERN GENERALIZATION AND COMMUNICATION OF RESULTS.

THIS IS DUE TO SEVERAL GOOD REASONS. PROBABLY AN IMPORTANT ONE OF THOSE REASONS IS THE GROWING DEMAND TO FIND PROPER WAYS TO FACE THE CHALLENGES OF ESTABLISHING DATA-DRIVEN ECONOMIES AND SOCIETIES. AS ACADEMICS AND EDUCATIONALISTS, BUT ALSO DATA SCIENCE PROFESSIONALS, WE LOOK AT HOW TO BRING UP THIS KIND OF SPECIALISTS SUCH THAT TO MEET THE CURRENT SHORTAGES BUT ALSO MID-TERM DEMANDS. IN THIS POSITION PAPER WE DELIBERATE ABOUT HOW TO ARCHITECT THEMATICALLY, DIDACTICALLY, AND ORGANIZATIONALLY A UNIVERSITY PROGRAM UNDER THE THEMATIC UMBRELLA OF DATA SCIENCE. WE FOCUS ON THE SELECTION OF LEARNING UNITS OR DISCIPLINES TO BE COVERED IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THE M.SCI. AND PH.D. GRADUATES WHO WILL BE READY TO FACE THE FUTURE CHALLENGES IN THE MID-TERM PERSPECTIVE. WE OUTLINE OUR RECOMMENDATION ON USING LEARNING TOOLS AND MATERIALS. WE ALSO CONCISELY PRESENT THE APPROACH FOR STIMULATING COMPETITIVE AND COOPERATIVE ATMOSPHERE IN THE CLASS THAT STIMULATES INTENSIVE COLLECTIVE AND INDIVIDUAL LEARNING. WE RECOMMEND TO REINFORCE AN ACADEMIC PROGRAM BY INVOLVING INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS INTENSIVELY IN THE PROCESS. WE GROUND OUR DELIBERATION ON OUR EXPERIENCE IN IMPLEMENTING RELEVANT M.SCI. AND PH.D.

THE POWER OF EVIDENCE-BASED, INDUCTIVE REASONING DISTINGUISHES DATA SCIENCE FROM SCIENCE. HENCE, THIS CHAPTER ARGUES THAT, IN ITS INITIAL STAGES, DATA SCIENCE APPLICATIONS AND THE DATA SCIENCE DISCIPLINE ITSELF BE DEVELOPED INDUCTIVELY AND DEDUCTIVELY IN A VIRTUOUS CYCLE. THE VIRTUES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY VIRTUOUS CYCLE (AKA VIRTUOUS HARDWARESOFTWARE CYCLE, INTEL-MICROSOFT VIRTUOUS CYCLE) THAT BUILT THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY (NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, THE NEW GLOBAL ECOSYSTEM IN ADVANCED COMPUTING: IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. COMPETITIVENESS AND NATIONAL SECURITY. THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES PRESS, WASHINGTON, DC, 2012) WERE BEING GROUNDED IN REALITY AND BEING SELF-PERPETUATING-MORE POWERFUL HARDWARE ENABLED MORE POWERFUL SOFTWARE THAT REQUIRED MORE POWERFUL HARDWARE, ENABLING YET MORE POWERFUL SOFTWARE, AND SO FORTH. BEING GROUNDED IN REALITY-SOLVING GENUINE PROBLEMS AT SCALE-WAS CRITICAL TO ITS SUCCESS, AS IT WILL BE FOR DATA SCIENCE. WHILE IT LASTED, IT WAS SELF-PERPETUATING, DUE TO A CONSTANT FLOW OF INNOVATION, AND TO BENEFITTING ALL PARTICIPANTS-PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS, THE INDUSTRY, THE ECONOMY, AND SOCIETY. IT IS A WONDERFUL SUCCESS STORY FOR TWENTIETH CENTURY APPLIED SCIENCE. GIVEN THE SUCCESS OF VIRTUOUS CYCLES IN DEVELOPING MODERN TECHNOLOGY, VIRTUOUS CYCLES GROUNDED IN REALITY SHOULD BE USED TO DEVELOP DATA SCIENCE, DRIVEN BY THE WISDOM OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY PROVERB, NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION. THIS CHAPTER EXPLORES THIS HYPOTHESIS USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE EVOLUTION OF DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS. FOR THE APPLICATION OF DATA SCIENCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND VIRTUOUS, IT SHOULD BE GROUNDED IN A CYCLE THAT ENCOMPASSES INDUSTRY (I.E., REAL PROBLEMS), RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DELIVERY. THIS CHAPTER PROPOSES APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES AND LESSONS OF THE VIRTUOUS CYCLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA SCIENCE APPLICATIONS; TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DATA SCIENCE DISCIPLINE ITSELF, FOR EXAMPLE, A DATA SCIENCE METHOD; AND TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; ALL FOCUSING ON THE CRITICAL ROLE OF COLLABORATION IN DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT, THEREBY ADDRESSING THE DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES FACED BY THE MORE THAN 150 DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH INSTITUTES (DSRIS) WORLDWIDE.

THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO ANALYZE THE CURRENT SKILL-GAPS NEEDS FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ESTABLISH DATA SCIENCE POSTGRADUATE PROGRAMME THAT REFLECTS THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND MARKET DEMANDS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DAR ES SALAAM (UDSM). A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED TO 85 IDENTIFIED ORGANIZATIONS TO SOLICIT INFORMATION ON THE NEEDS FOR DATA SCIENTISTS AND EXISTING SKILL GAPS. A TOTAL OF 61 FILLED QUESTIONNAIRES RESPONSE WERE RECEIVED OUT OF THE 85 THAT WERE ADMINISTERED TO SELECTED ORGANIZATIONS INDICATING A TURN OUT RATE OF OVER 70%. OVERALL THE ANALYZED DATA ARTICULATED A COMPELLING EVIDENCE FOR THE LOCAL INDUSTRY GROWING NEED FOR DATA SCIENTIST.

DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA SCIENTISTS ARE RECOGNISED TO BE QUITE IMPORTANT IN BOTH SOCIAL AND BUSINESS CONTEXTS. THE IPSJ DS CURRICULUM STANDARD IS DEVELOPED BY INTEGRATING VARIOUS RELATED INITIATIVES AND HAS THE FOLLOWING UNIQUE FEATURES. (1) THE DS CURRICULUM STANDARD COVERS A WIDE RANGE OF RELATED FIELDS TO ENSURE INTERNATIONAL COMPATIBILITY THROUGH MAPPING TO THE ACM DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM AND THE EUROPEAN EDISON DATA SCIENCE FRAMEWORK. (2) IT COLLABORATES WITH THE IPSJ DATA SCIENTIST CERTIFICATION (UNDER DEVELOPMENT) BY REFERRING TO THE DATA SCIENTIST SKILL CHECKLIST (ASSISTANT LEVEL) DEVELOPED BY THE DATA SCIENTIST SOCIETY OF JAPAN. (3) IT CLARIFIES THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS REQUIRED OF STUDENTS MAJORING IN DATA SCIENCE. (4) IT ASSIGNS A TIME TO EACH EDUCATIONAL CONTENT SO THAT THE CURRICULUM SIZE BECOMES APPROXIMATELY 675 CLASS HOURS (60 CREDITS IN THE JAPANESE CREDIT SYSTEM).

IN INVOKING EXPONENTIAL GROWTH, MATHEMATICAL MODELLING, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, AND THE LIKE, THESE DATA VISUALIZATIONS INVITE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MATHEMATICS TEACHING AND LEARNING. YET DATA VISUALIZATIONS ARE SOCIAL TEXTS, AUTHORED FROM SPECIFIC POINTS OF VIEW, THAT NARRATE PARTICULAR, AND OFTEN CONSEQUENTIAL, STORIES. THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RELIANCE ON QUANTIFICATION AND MATHEMATICS CEMENTS THEIR SOCIAL POSITIONING AS SUPPOSEDLY OBJECTIVE, RELIABLE, AND NEUTRAL. THE READING OF ANY DATA VISUALIZATION DEMANDS UNPACKING THE ROLE OF MATHEMATICS, INCLUDING HOW DATA AND VARIABLES HAVE BEEN FORMATTED AND HOW RELATIONSHIPS ARE FRAMED TO NARRATE STORIES FROM PARTICULAR POINTS OF VIEW. WE PRESENT AN APPROACH TO A CRITICAL READING OF DATA VISUALIZATIONS FOR THE CONTEXT OF MATHEMATICS EDUCATION THAT DRAWS ON THREE INTERRELATED CONCEPTS: MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING (WHAT GETS QUANTIFIED, MEASURED, AND HOW), FRAMING (HOW VARIABLES ARE RELATED AND THROUGH WHAT KIND OF DATA VISUALIZATION), AND NARRATING (WHICH STORIES THE DATA VISUALIZATION TELLS, ITS POTENTIAL IMPACTS AND LIMITS).

AT THE SAME TIME, PHILOSOPHERS OF SCIENCE FACE THE CHALLENGE OF MAKING THEIR EXPERTISE ACCESSIBLE FOR SCIENTISTS IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT CAN IMPROVE EVERYDAY RESEARCH PRACTICE. HERE, WE INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY OF APPROACHING THESE CHALLENGES TOGETHER. IN CURRENT AND PROPOSED APPROACHES TO BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, WE IDENTIFY A DOMINANT FOCUS ON ONLY ONE ASPECT OF CONDUCTING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: UNDERSTANDING AND USING DATA, RESEARCH METHODS, AND STATISTICAL METHODS. WE ARGUE THAT THIS APPROACH CANNOT SOLVE BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE'S CHALLENGE AND WE PROPOSE TO SHIFT THE FOCUS TO FOUR OTHER ASPECTS OF CONDUCTING RESEARCH: MAKING AND JUSTIFYING DECISIONS IN RESEARCH DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION, EXPLAINING THEIR EPISTEMIC AND NON-EPISTEMIC EFFECTS, BALANCING VARYING RESPONSIBILITIES, AND REPORTING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. ATTENDING TO THESE ASPECTS REQUIRES LEARNING ON DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS THAN SOLELY LEARNING TO APPLY TECHNIQUES (FIRST DIMENSION). IT ALSO REQUIRES LEARNING TO MAKE CHOICES (SECOND DIMENSION) AND TO UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE BEHIND CHOICES (THIRD DIMENSION). THIS COULD BE FOSTERED BY INTEGRATING PHILOSOPHICAL TRAINING IN BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. FURTHERMORE, PHILOSOPHICAL TRAINING FOSTERS A FOURTH DIMENSION OF LEARNING, NAMELY, UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF SCIENCE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EXPLAIN HOW WE IDENTIFIED THE FIVE ASPECTS OF CONDUCTING RESEARCH AND THE FOUR DIMENSIONS OF LEARNING, AND WHY ATTENDING TO THE FOURTH DIMENSION IS ESSENTIAL.

IN THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY, WE AIMED TO UNDERSTAND (A) WHAT APT EPISTEMIC PROCESSES WITHIN DATA LITERACY LOOK LIKE IN PRACTICE WITH CHILDREN, AND (B) TO WHAT EXTENT A CURRICULUM BUILT ON A SIMULATION-BASED DATA ANALYSIS INTERVENTION (WHERE STUDENTS ENGAGE IN EXPERIMENTATION AND DATA ANALYSES THROUGH THE USE OF SIMULATIONS) PROMOTES THE EPISTEMIC PROCESSES OF DATA LITERACY. WE USED THE APT-AIR FRAMEWORK, WHICH EXPOUNDS ON THE COMPONENTS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL EPISTEMIC EDUCATION, AS A TOOL TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS' APT EPISTEMIC PROCESSES.

WE EXAMINED THE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO DATA WRANGLING PRACTICES BY INVESTIGATING YOUTH'S TALK-IN-INTERACTION WHILE ASSEMBLING MODELS AND STORIES ABOUT FAMILY MIGRATION USING INTERACTIVE DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS AND LARGE SOCIOECONOMIC DATASETS. WE FIRST IDENTIFIED TEN SOCIOTECHNICAL PRACTICES THAT CHARACTERIZE YOUTH'S INTERACTION WITH TOOLS AND COLLABORATION IN DATA WRANGLING. WE THEN SUGGEST FOUR CATEGORIES OF ACTIVITIES TO DESCRIBE PATTERNS OF LEARNING RELATED TO THE PRACTICES, INCLUDING ADDRESSING MISSING DATA, UNDERSTANDING DATA AGGREGATION, EXPLORING SOCIAL OR HISTORICAL EVENTS THAT CONSTITUTE THE FORMATION OF DATA PATTERNS, AND VARYING DATA VISUAL ENCODING FOR STORYTELLING. THESE PRACTICES AND ACTIVITIES ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND FOR SUPPORTING FUTURE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES THAT FACILITATE LEARNING AND DISCUSSION ABOUT SCIENTIFIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC ISSUES.

INNOVATION, COMPUTATION, AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES HAVE NOW TREMENDOUSLY ACCELERATED THE PACE OF DISCOVERY, PROVIDING DRIVERLESS CARS, ROBOTIC DEVICES, EXPERT HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, PRECISION MEDICINE, AND AUTOMATED DISCOVERY TO MENTION A FEW. EVEN THOUGH THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM DATA SCIENCE CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, THE SWEEPING IMPACT IT HAS ALREADY PRODUCED ON SOCIETY IS UNDENIABLE. WE ARE AT A POINT WHEN NEW DISCOVERIES THROUGH DATA SCIENCE HAVE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL TO ADVANCE PROGRESS BUT ALSO TO BE USED MALICIOUSLY, WITH HARMFUL ETHICAL AND SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES. PERHAPS NOWHERE IS THIS MORE CLEARLY EXEMPLIFIED THAN IN THE BIOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL SCIENCES. THE CONFLUENCE OF (1) MACHINE LEARNING, (2) MATHEMATICAL MODELING, (3) COMPUTATION/SIMULATION, AND (4) BIG DATA HAVE MOVED US FROM THE SEQUENCING OF GENOMES TO GENE EDITING AND INDIVIDUALIZED MEDICINE; YET, UNSETTLED POLICIES REGARDING DATA PRIVACY AND ETHICAL NORMS COULD POTENTIALLY OPEN DOORS FOR SERIOUS NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS. THE DATA SCIENCE REVOLUTION HAS AMPLIFIED THE URGENT NEED FOR A PARADIGM SHIFT IN UNDERGRADUATE BIOLOGY EDUCATION. IT HAS REAFFIRMED THAT DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION INTERACTS AND ENHANCES MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION IN ADVANCING QUANTITATIVE CONCEPTUAL AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT FOR THE NEW GENERATION OF BIOLOGISTS. THESE CONNECTIONS ENCOURAGE US TO STRIVE TO CULTIVATE A BROADLY SKILLED WORKFORCE OF TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY PROBLEM-SOLVERS, SKILLED AT HANDLING THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES PERTAINING TO BIOLOGICAL DATA, AND CAPABLE OF COLLABORATING ACROSS VARIOUS DISCIPLINES IN THE SCIENCES, THE HUMANITIES, AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, WE SUGGEST DEVELOPMENT OF OPEN CURRICULA THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE JOB CERTIFICATION RHETORIC AND COMBINE DATA ACUMEN WITH MODELING, EXPERIMENTAL, AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS THROUGH ENGAGING PROJECTS, WHILE ALSO PROVIDING AWARENESS AND DEEP EXPLORATION OF THEIR SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS.

HOWEVER, MANY ITS RELY HEAVILY ON EXPERT DESIGN AND HAND-CRAFTED RULES. THIS MAKES THEM DIFFICULT TO BUILD AND TRANSFER ACROSS DOMAINS AND LIMITS THEIR POTENTIAL EFFICACY. IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATE HOW FEEDBACK IN A LARGE-SCALE ITS CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED IN A DATA-DRIVEN WAY, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY HOW PERSONALIZATION OF FEEDBACK CAN LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN STUDENT PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES. FIRST, IN THIS PAPER WE PROPOSE A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO GENERATE PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK IN AN AUTOMATED WAY, WHICH TAKES INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF STUDENTS INTO ACCOUNT, WHILE ALLEVIATING THE NEED OF EXPERT INTERVENTION AND DESIGN OF HAND-CRAFTED RULES.

THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO MAP THE LANDSCAPE OF EXISTING CURRICULA AND EXPLORE HOW ACADEMIC LIBRARIES CAN COLLABORATE AND CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERGRADUATE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYZED TEACHING CONTENT AND TOPICS OF OVER 100 DATA SCIENCE RELATED COURSES AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY TO MAP THE LANDSCAPE AND EXPLORE ROLES OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES TO SUPPORT DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION CURRICULUM. OUR RESULTS INDICATE MOST EXISTING COURSES FOCUSED ON ?HARD-CORE? SCIENTIFIC ANALYTIC PRINCIPLES, SUCH AS COMPUTER SCIENCE, STATISTICS, AND DOMAIN-SPECIFIC SKILLS. COURSES OF DATA-ORIENTED SKILLS, SUCH AS DATA MANAGEMENT, DATA ETHICS, AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS WERE LIMITED ACROSS DISCIPLINES. IN ADDITION, DATA SCIENCE COURSES WERE MORE LIKELY TARGETING STEM STUDENTS AT UPPER LEVELS (3RD AND 4TH YEAR STUDENTS).

THIS PAPER PRESENTS A HIGHLY INNOVATIVE COURSE IN A UK UNIVERSITY THAT INTRODUCES UNDERGRADUATE MEDICAL STUDENTS TO DATA SCIENCE. IT ALSO DISCUSSES A STUDY ON STUDENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE LEARNING AND TEACHING OF HEALTH DATA SCIENCE.METHODS: THE PEDAGOGICAL DESIGN ELEMENTS OF THE DATA SCIENCE IN MEDICINE COURSE ARE DISCUSSED, ALONG WITH ITS SYLLABUS, ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY AND FLIPPED CLASSROOM DELIVERY. THE COURSE HAS BEEN OFFERED TO APPROXIMATELY 630 STUDENTS OVER THREE YEARS. STUDENT PERSPECTIVES WERE INVESTIGATED THROUGH THREE FOCUS GROUPS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF 19 STUDENTS ACROSS DIFFERENT STUDY YEARS IN MEDICINE. AN EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED REGARDING INSTRUCTOR-LED VS. VIDEO-BASED MODALITIES OF ONLINE PROGRAMMING LABS, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF 8 STUDENTS.RESULTS: THE COURSE HAS LED TO IMPROVED DATA COMPETENCY AMONG MEDICAL STUDENTS AND TO A POSITIVE CHANGE IN THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT DATA SCIENCE. MOTIVATING THE COURSE AND SHOWING RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES. STATISTICS WAS PERCEIVED BY FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS AS AN ESSENTIAL DATA SKILL. INCLUDING DATA SCIENCE IN THE MEDICAL CURRICULUM WAS PERCEIVED AS IMPORTANT BY YEAR 1 STUDENTS, WHILE OPINIONS VARIED BETWEEN YEAR 4/5 PARTICIPANTS. VIDEO-BASED ONLINE LABS WERE PREFERRED OVER INSTRUCTOR-LED ONLINE LABS, AND THEY WERE FOUND TO BE MORE USEFUL AND ENJOYABLE, WITHOUT LEADING TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. CONCLUSIONS: TEACHING DATA SCIENCE TO UNDERGRADUATE MEDICINE STUDENTS IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE AND FEASIBLE. WE RECOMMEND INCLUDING STATISTICS IN THE CURRICULUM AND PRACTICAL SKILL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH SIMPLE AND CLINICALLYRELEVANT DATA SCIENCE TASKS, SUPPORTED THROUGH VIDEO-BASED ONLINE LABS.

IN DATA SCIENCES, THERE ARE TWO RELATED BUT DISTINCT STRATEGIES: HYPOTHESIS TESTING AND BINARY CLASSIFICATION. IN PRACTICE, HOW TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THESE TWO STRATEGIES CAN BE UNCLEAR AND RATHER CONFUSING. HERE, WE SUMMARIZE KEY DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THESE TWO STRATEGIES IN THREE ASPECTS AND LIST FIVE PRACTICAL GUIDELINES FOR DATA ANALYSTS TO CHOOSE THE APPROPRIATE STRATEGY FOR SPECIFIC ANALYSIS NEEDS. WE DEMONSTRATE THE USE OF THOSE GUIDELINES IN A CANCER DRIVER GENE PREDICTION EXAMPLE. IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, TWO ANALYSIS STRATEGIES, HYPOTHESIS TESTING AND BINARY CLASSIFICATION, ARE MOSTLY COVERED IN DIFFERENT COURSES AND TEXTBOOKS. IN REAL DATA APPLICATION, IT CAN BE PUZZLING WHETHER A BINARY DECISION PROBLEM SHOULD BE FORMULATED AS HYPOTHESIS TESTING OR BINARY CLASSIFICATION. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DISENTANGLE THE PUZZLE FOR DATA SCIENCE STUDENTS AND RESEARCHERS BY OFFERING PRACTICAL GUIDELINES FOR CHOOSING BETWEEN THE TWO STRATEGIES. HYPOTHESIS TESTING AND BINARY CLASSIFICATION ARE TWO DATA ANALYSIS STRATEGIES TAUGHT MOSTLY IN DIFFERENT UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES AND RARELY COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER. AS A RESULT, WHICH STRATEGY IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR A SPECIFIC REAL-WORLD DATA ANALYSIS TASK IS OFTEN AMBIGUOUS.

ALTHOUGH SOME CONCEPTIONS OF DATA SCIENCE FOCUS PRIMARILY ON ANALYTICAL METHODS, DATA SCIENTISTS MUST ALSO HAVE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PROJECT DATA WERE COLLECTED, PREPROCESSED AND TRANSFORMED. THESE PROCESSES STRONGLY INFLUENCE THE ANALYTICAL METHODS THAT CAN BE APPLIED, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW THE RESULTS OF THOSE METHODS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED. IN THE PRESENT CHAPTER WE PROVIDE BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES FOR DATA SCIENTISTS AND REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF A WORKSHOP WHERE EXPERTS FROM THE INFORMATION FIELD BRAINSTORMED ON THE EDUCATIONAL DIMENSIONS OF DATA SCIENCE. RESULTS OF THE WORKSHOP SHOWED THAT DATA SCIENTISTS MUST POSSESS A BREADTH OF EXPERTISE ACROSS THREE AREAS - CURATION, ANALYTICS, AND CYBER-INFRASTRUCTURE - WITH DEEP KNOWLEDGE IN AT LEAST ONE OF THESE AREAS. WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS ALSO UNDERSCORED THE IMPORTANCE OF DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE DATA SCIENCE ROLE. ADDITIONALLY, THE WORKSHOP HIGHLIGHTED A FACTOR THAT DIFFERENTIATES DATA SCIENCE FROM OTHER PROFESSIONAL SPECIALTIES: THE EMPHASIS ON SERVING THE DATA NEEDS OF INFORMATION USERS AND DECISION MAKERS. © 2012 AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY.",,DATA VISUALIZATION; INFORMATION MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION SERVICES; BACKGROUND INFORMATION; CYBER INFRASTRUCTURES; EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGE; HETEROGENEOUS DATA; INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS; INFORMATION USERS; SCIENCE EDUCATION; WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS; METADATA,,,"ALLARD, S., LEVINE, K.J., TENOPIR, C., DESIGN ENGINEERS AND TECHNICAL PROFESSIONALS AT WORK: OBSERVING INFORMATION USAGE IN THE WORKPLACE (2009) J.

LEARNING THESE SKILLS FROM TRADITIONAL UNIVERSITY CURRICULA CAN BE CHALLENGING BECAUSE MOST COURSES ARE NOT DESIGNED TO EVOLVE ON TIME SCALES THAT CAN KEEP PACE WITH RAPIDLY SHIFTING DATA SCIENCE METHODS. HERE, WE PRESENT THE CONCEPT OF A HACK WEEK AS AN EFFECTIVE MODEL OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES FOR NETWORKING AND COMMUNITY BUILDING, EDUCATION IN STATE-OF-THE-ART DATA SCIENCE METHODS, AND IMMERSION IN COLLABORATIVE PROJECT WORK.

THESE TRAININGS PROVIDE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN THE SKILLS TO WORK ON DATA SCIENCE, WITH SOME FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON WOMEN AND GIRLS. WHILE THIS IS ENCOURAGING AND BRINGS NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE WIDER CONTEXT OF DATA SCIENCE TRAINING IN AFRICA, IN PARTICULAR, HOW WOMEN AND GIRLS EXPERIENCE THEIR (DATA SCIENCE) EDUCATION, AND HOW THIS KNOWLEDGE CAN IMPACT THEIR LIVES, SUSTAIN LIVELIHOODS AND BRING EMPOWERMENT. THROUGH A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE, AS WELL AS AN EXAMINATION OF DIFFERENT PEDAGOGICAL APPROACHES AND PRACTICES USED BY VARIOUS FORMAL AND INFORMAL TRAINING PROGRAMS IN AFRICA, WE EXAMINED THE EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN AND GIRLS. WE CONDUCTED A MAPPING OF THE TRAINING AND NETWORKS THAT HAVE BEEN SET UP TO PROVIDE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS AND TO EMPOWER WOMEN IN DATA SCIENCE.

HERE WE INVESTIGATE HOW MUSEUM VISITORS MADE USE OF AN ACTOR PERSPECTIVE WHEN EXPLORING AN OPEN-ENDED, INTERACTIVE DATA MAP MUSEUM EXHIBIT. WE USE A MIX OF QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE EMPIRICAL METHODS TO EXPLORE HOW ACTOR PERSPECTIVE-TAKING (APT) MAY MEDIATE JOINT SENSEMAKING AROUND DATA VISUALIZATIONS. BY APPLYING INTERPRETIVE CODING TO 54 CONVERSATIONS WHEREIN APT NATURALISTICALLY EMERGED, WE IDENTIFY 3 DISTINCT SELF-TO-DATA RELATIONSHIPS CONSTRUCTED VIA APT: ROLE-PLAY, PROJECTION, AND ORIENTATION. A FURTHER ANALYSIS EXPLORES HOW APT WAS EMBEDDED IN JOINT SENSEMAKING OF THE VISUALIZED DATA. TWELVE APT-MEDIATED SENSEMAKING PROCESSES ARE IDENTIFIED; TWO (EXTRAPOLATING AND NOTICING ABSENCE) WERE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MULTIPLE APT SELF-TO-DATA RELATIONSHIPS, WHILE THE REMAINING TEN (E.G., ENACTING, SPATIALLY CHARACTERIZING, GENERALIZING) WERE EXCLUSIVELY USED WITH SPECIFIC SELF-TO-DATA APT RELATIONSHIPS.

WE CHARACTERIZE JSDSE'S K-12 IMPACT PARTIALLY IN TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO FOSTER STATISTICAL KNOWLEDGE FOR TEACHING (SKT). WE ALSO INTRODUCE A NEW CONSTRUCT, STATISTICAL KNOWLEDGE FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF TEACHING (SKT2), TO MORE FULLY CAPTURE THE K-12 CONTRIBUTIONS JSDSE CAN MAKE. OUR ANALYSIS DRAWS UPON THE PERSPECTIVES OF AN EXPERIENCED HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER (THE FIRST AUTHOR) AND A STATISTICS EDUCATION RESEARCHER (THE SECOND AUTHOR). THE FIRST AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE SURVEYED RECENT JSDSE ISSUES TO IDENTIFY AND REFLECT UPON ARTICLES WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR HIS TEACHING PRACTICE. THE SECOND AUTHOR FRAMED THE FIRST AUTHOR'S ARTICLE REFLECTIONS IN TERMS OF THEIR CONNECTIONS TO SKT AND SKT2. DRAWING UPON OUR COLLABORATIVE ANALYSIS, WE PROPOSE STRATEGIES TO HELP JSDSE MORE FULLY REALIZE ITS POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO SKT AND SKT2.

RESULTS SHOW THAT THE STUDENTS COULD FACILITATE MEETINGS AND COMMUNICATE COMPARABLY WELL TO THE EXPERIENCED COLLABORATOR, BUT THAT THE EXPERIENCED COLLABORATOR WAS BETTER ABLE TO FACILITATE MEETINGS AND COMMUNICATE TO DEVELOP STRONG RELATIONSHIPS, AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT FOR HIGH-QUALITY AND LONG-TERM COLLABORATION.

THIS NEW FIELD REQUIRES A WIDE RANGE OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS FROM DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES INCLUDING MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS, COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PRESENT THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY THAT EXPLORED THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE FROM THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE (LIS) PERSPECTIVE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH ANALYSIS OF RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS ON DATA SCIENCE WAS MADE ON THE BASIS OF PAPERS PUBLISHED IN THE WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE. THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS WERE PROPOSED: WHAT ARE THE MAIN TENDENCIES IN PUBLICATION YEARS, DOCUMENT TYPES, COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN, SOURCE TITLES, AUTHORS OF PUBLICATIONS, AFFILIATIONS OF THE ARTICLE AUTHORS AND THE MOST CITED ARTICLES RELATED TO DATA SCIENCE IN THE FIELD OF LIS? WHAT ARE THE MAIN THEMES DISCUSSED IN THE PUBLICATIONS FROM THE LIS PERSPECTIVE? FINDINGS THE HIGHEST CONTRIBUTION TO DATA SCIENCE COMES FROM THE COMPUTER SCIENCE RESEARCH COMMUNITY. THE CONTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND LIBRARY SCIENCE COMMUNITY IS QUITE SMALL. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN CONTINUOUS INCREASE IN ARTICLES FROM THE YEAR 2015. THE MAIN DOCUMENT TYPES ARE JOURNAL ARTICLES, FOLLOWED BY CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS AND EDITORIAL MATERIAL. THE TOP THREE JOURNALS THAT PUBLISH DATA SCIENCE PAPERS FROM THE LIS PERSPECTIVE ARE THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION, THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND THE JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. THE TOP FIVE COUNTRIES PUBLISHING ARE USA, CHINA, ENGLAND, AUSTRALIA AND INDIA. THE MOST CITED ARTICLE HAS GOT 112 CITATIONS. THE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE DATA SCIENCE FIELD IS QUITE INTERDISCIPLINARY BY NATURE. IN ADDITION TO THE FIELD OF LIS THE PAPERS BELONGED TO SEVERAL OTHER RESEARCH AREAS.

THE PLATFORM CONTAINS THREE COMPONENTS: AN EXPLORING WINDOW, A CONTROL WINDOWS AND A REPORT WINDOW. THE EXPLORING WINDOW SHOWS CURRENT AND HISTORICAL STOCK PRICE TRENDS AND RELATED INDICATORS. SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVE STOCKS FROM DIFFERENT SECTORS CAN BE PICKED AND SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES CAN BE ASSIGNED. THE CONTROL WINDOW ALLOWS STUDENTS TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN TRADING STRATEGIES. A TRADING STRATEGY CAN BE CREATED BY EITHER INTUITIVE WAY, OR THROUGH SINGLE OR COMBINATIONS OF INDICATORS, OR BE BUILT GENERICALLY THOUGH PLUG-IN R-PROGRAMING MODULE. THE REPORT WINDOW DEMONSTRATES THE EXPECTED RETURN OF A STOCK IN A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME THROUGH A SPECIFIC STRATEGY. A MORE COMPREHENSIVE REPORT WITH DETAILED TRANSACTION INFORMATION IS ALSO PROVIDED FOR BACK-TESTING PURPOSE. STUDENTS ARE INVOLVED INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOFTWARE AND GET EXPERIENCE FOR R-PROGRAMMING. PRELIMINARY VERSION OF THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN TESTED AND SURVEYED IN A DATA SCIENCE CLASSROOM. ABOUT TEN JUNIOR DATA SCIENCE STUDENTS HAVE PRACTICED AND PROVIDED FEEDBACK. THE POSITIVE SURVEY RESULTS SHOW THE FEASIBILITY OF THE APPROACH. IN THE FUTURE, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT COMPONENT WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THE PLATFORM. © 2020 IEEE.",DATA SCIENCE; R-PROGRAMMING; TRADING PLATFORM,COMMERCE; DATA SCIENCE; EDUCATION COMPUTING; ELECTRONIC TRADING; FINANCIAL MARKETS; SURVEYS; ANALYSIS PROCESS; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT; PROCESS OF LEARNING; SCIENCE CLASSROOM; SCIENCE EDUCATION; STATISTICAL INDICATORS; TRADING STRATEGIES; TRANSACTION INFORMATION; STUDENTS,,,"METZ, C., (2017), HTTPS://WWW.NYTIMES.COM/2017/10/22/TECHNOLOGY/ARTIFICIALINTELLIGENCE-EXPERTS-SALARIES.HTML, 22 OCT.

THE GROWING FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS MANY OF THESE NEEDS, PRIMARILY DUE TO RECENT EFFORTS TO COLLECT LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA RELATED TO SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND POLITICAL ISSUES. A CHALLENGE IS THAT THERE EXISTS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THESE REAL-WORLD ISSUES AND THE COURSE MATERIALS TAUGHT TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. THIS GAP IS DUE IN PART TO A LACK OF ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES AND THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, LEAVING STUDENTS WITH FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH DATASETS RELEVANT TO REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS. TO ADDRESS THIS DISCONNECT, THE AUTHORS HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NOVEL DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAM IN WHICH STUDENTS ACQUIRE NEW KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS WHILE CREATING POSITIVE SOCIAL IMPACT THROUGH COMMUNITY SERVICE. IN THIS WORK, WE OUTLINE THIS OUTREACH PROGRAM, THE MICHIGAN DATA SCIENCE TEAM, AND PROVIDE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF POSITIVE EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT. © 2018 IEEE.",COLLABORATIVE LEARNING; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; SERVICE-LEARNING; SOCIAL IMPACT,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL EFFECTS; COLLABORATIVE LEARNING; COMMUNITY SERVICES; LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA; REAL-WORLD PROBLEM; SCIENCE EDUCATION; SERVICE LEARNING; SOCIAL IMPACT; UNIVERSITY STUDENTS; STUDENTS,"HORACE H.

PROJECT-BASED LEARNING (PBL) IS A WELL-KNOWN PEDAGOGICAL TOOL FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY EDUCATION. IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISH INTERDISCIPLINARY LEARNING, STUDENTS MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE IN EACH OF THE SEPARATE DISCIPLINES. USE OF CROSS-DISCIPLINARY TEAMS, FOR EXAMPLE, IS ONE WAY TO MAKE SURE A PROJECT TEAM INCLUDES SPECIALISTS IN ALL REQUIRED DISCIPLINES. THIS, HOWEVER, IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE. IN MANY CASES, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS WITHIN THE PROJECT TEAM IN ONE OR MORE OF THE PROJECT DOMAINS. SPECIFICALLY, IN OUR CASE, FOURTH-YEAR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS ARE WORKING IN PAIRS ON BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING PROJECTS, WHICH ARE EVIDENTLY INTERDISCIPLINARY IN NATURE. THE TEAMS, HOWEVER, ARE HOMOGENEOUS AND THE STUDENTS LACK THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL EXPERTISE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE SOLUTIONS APPLICABLE BY PHYSICIANS. FURTHERMORE, STUDENTS TEND TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS GAP ONLY IN THE ADVANCED PHASES OF THE PROJECT, AND SO CRITICAL PHASES, SUCH AS GOAL SETTING AND PLANNING, ARE PERFORMED WITHOUT THE REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PRESENT (A) DATA THAT SUPPORTS THE EXISTENCE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP AND ITS EFFECT ON STUDENTS; (B) AN INTERVENTION PROGRAM THAT EXPOSES STUDENTS TO BOTH THE REQUIRED DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE AND ITS IMPORTANCE TO THEIR WORK; AND (C) INITIAL DATA THAT SUPPORTS THE SUCCESS OF THIS INTERVENTION PROGRAM IN BRIDGING THESE GAPS. © 2020 IEEE.",BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; INTERDISCIPLINARY EDUCATION; PROJECT-BASED LEARNING,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING; C (PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE); ENGINEERING EDUCATION; CROSS-DISCIPLINARY TEAMS; ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS; INTERDISCIPLINARY EDUCATION; INTERDISCIPLINARY LEARNING; INTERVENTION PROGRAMS; PEDAGOGICAL TOOLS; PROJECT BASED LEARNING; REAL-LIFE PROBLEMS; STUDENTS,,,"ALVARGONZA, D., MULTIDISCIPLINARITY, INTERDISCIPLINARITY, TRANSDISCIPLINARITY, AND THE SCIENCES (2011) INT.

A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY (83%) OF THE PARTICIPANTS OF THIS WORKSHOP SELF-IDENTIFIED AS WOMEN. THIS GENDER PROPORTION, THE OPPOSITE OF THAT PREVAILING IN STEM STUDIES, LED US TO EXAMINE THE WORKSHOP FROM A GENDER PERSPECTIVE. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN THE DATA SCIENCE WORKSHOP PERCEIVED IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE RESEARCH TOOLS RATHER THAN PROGRAMMING TOOLS. WE SUGGEST THAT FRAMING THE WORKSHOP AS A RESEARCH TOOL WORKSHOP AND NOT AS A PROGRAMMING WORKSHOP REDUCED PREVALENT GENDER BARRIERS IN STEM, ENCOURAGING A MAJORITY OF WOMEN RESEARCHERS TO PARTICIPATE. IN THIS PAPER, WE ELABORATE ON THE PARTICIPANTS' PERCEPTIONS ABOUT DATA SCIENCE AND PROGRAMMING AND ANALYZE THEM BASED ON THREE THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES: EXPECTANCY VALUE THEORY, THE INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE, AND THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE.

DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION HAS SEEN RAPID GROWTH OVER THE PAST DECADE. TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH HANDS-ON OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH REAL DATA, MANY DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS HAVE ADVOCATED FOR AND IMPLEMENTED EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE CURRICULUM, WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN IN A WIDE VARIETY OF LITERATURE TO HAVE MANY BENEFITS. MOST EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES IN STEM PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED THROUGH CAPSTONE AND ENGINEERING DESIGN COURSES; THIS IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY THE CASE IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS AS WELL WHERE SEVERAL UNIVERSITIES HAVE DEVELOPED DATA SCIENCE CAPSTONE PROGRAMS IN WHICH STUDENTS WORK WITH CLIENTS ON THE CLIENT'S REAL-WORLD DATA SETS. WHILE CLIENT-SPONSORED CAPSTONE PROJECTS ARE AN EXEMPLAR OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING, THEY MAY POSE MAJOR CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENT AND CAN BE PARTICULARLY RESOURCE-INTENSIVE FOR INSTITUTIONS; THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE CASE IN DATA SCIENCE WHERE THE LEGALITIES OF DATA SHARING MAY COME WITH ADDITIONAL HURDLES. BECAUSE OF THIS, WE WERE MOTIVATED TO DEVELOP A NOVEL CLIENT-FACING DATA SCIENCE CONSULTING COURSE THAT PROVIDES A UNIQUE EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING SCENARIO TO BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS WHILE REQUIRING MUCH FEWER RESOURCES AND LEGALITIES. IN OUR NOVEL DATA SCIENCE CONSULTING COURSE, GROUPS OF STUDENTS WORK DIRECTLY WITH REAL CLIENTS IN A CONSULTING CLINIC SETTING TO PROVIDE DATA SCIENCE GUIDANCE AND SHORT-TERM HELP WITH DATA SCIENCE CHALLENGES. THROUGH THIS PROCESS, STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS IN DATA SCIENCE, HOW TO LEAD CONSULTATIONS WITH CLIENTS EFFECTIVELY AS A TEAM, HOW TO FRAME DATA SCIENCE CHALLENGES AND RESEARCH POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS, AND HOW TO COMMUNICATE SOLUTIONS TO CLIENTS IN REPORTS AND PRESENTATIONS. WE LEVERAGED BEST PRACTICES IN CONSULTING COURSES DEVELOPED IN BUSINESS SCHOOL SETTINGS TO DESIGN OUR COURSE. ADDITIONALLY, THE CONSULTING COURSE SERVES AS A COMMUNITY SERVICE INITIATIVE WHEREBY RESEARCHERS, CLINICIANS, NON-PROFIT AND GOVERNMENT WORKERS, AND INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS BENEFIT FROM THE ADVICE AND SHORT-TERM HELP PROVIDED THROUGH CONSULTATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE REPORT HOW OUR CONSULTING COURSE IS SET UP, HOW CLIENTS FROM BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY CAN SEEK HELP AT THE CONSULTING CLINIC, AND HOW THE STRUCTURE OF THE COURSE ENABLES STUDENTS TO HAVE FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE WORKING ON MANY REAL-WORLD DATA SCIENCE PROBLEMS WITH CLIENTS. FINALLY, WE DISCUSS HOW STUDENT PERFORMANCE IS ASSESSED IN THIS COURSE, THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM OFFERING THIS COURSE, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OTHER DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS IN UNIVERSITIES THAT WISH TO DESIGN SIMILAR COURSES. © 2022 IEEE.",CONSULTING COURSE; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING,DATA SCIENCE; FACINGS; STUDENTS; CAPSTONE PROJECTS; CONSULTING COURSE; CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING; INNOVATIVE PRACTICES; LEARNING OPPORTUNITY; REAL-WORLD; SCIENCE EDUCATION; SCIENCE PROJECTS; CURRICULA,,,"ANDERSON, P., BOWRING, J., MCCAULEY, R., POTHERING, G., STARR, C., AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN DATA SCIENCE: CURRICULUM AND A DECADE OF IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE (2014) PROCEEDINGS OF THE 45TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, SER.

THE USE OF COMPUTING SOFTWARE HAS BECOME UBIQUITOUS AND A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF DATA SCIENCE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY ESSENTIAL FOR RESEARCHERS IN ALL DOMAINS. HOWEVER, CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT FOCUSING ON IMPARTING FOUNDATIONAL PROGRAMMING SKILLS AND FUNDAMENTALS OF DATA SCIENCE FOR RESEARCHERS IN DOMAINS OTHER THAN COMPUTING HAS BEEN SCARCE. THUS, THERE IS AN UNMET NEED FOR CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT INVOLVING COMPUTATIONAL THINKING, PROGRAMMING, AND THE FUNDAMENTALS OF DATA SCIENCE FOR THIS AUDIENCE. RECOGNIZING THESE GROWING NEEDS AND DEMANDS OF RESEARCHERS TO LEARN PROGRAMMING AND DATA SCIENCE THAT CAN THEN BE APPLIED TO THEIR AREA OF RESEARCH OR PRACTICE, WE DEVELOPED AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE IN PROGRAMMING AND DATA SCIENCE FOR PDRS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE COURSE WAS TO DEVELOP COMPUTATIONAL THINKING SKILLS IN PDRS WHO HAIL FROM BACKGROUNDS THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY NOT FOCUSED ON INCULCATING COMPUTATIONAL THINKING. THIS COURSE COVERED THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF PROGRAMMING USING EITHER PYTHON OR R - LANGUAGES THAT RESEARCHERS OUTSIDE THE COMPUTING COMMUNITY USE IN NUMEROUS WAYS INCLUDING THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF LARGE DATASETS THAT ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMMON IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. FURTHER, PDRS ENROLLED IN THE COURSE WERE INTRODUCED TO SOME OF THE BROAD CATEGORIES OF PROBLEMS IN DATA SCIENCE - EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS, CLASSIFICATION, REGRESSION, AND CLUSTERING - ALONG WITH RELEVANT ALGORITHMS AND HOW THEY CAN BE APPLIED TO REAL-WORLD DATASETS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE DOMAINS USING PACKAGES OR LIBRARIES IN PYTHON OR R. WE ALSO REPORT THE FEEDBACK FROM THE ENROLLED PDRS, LESSONS LEARNED, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INSTRUCTORS INTERESTED IN DESIGNING SIMILAR CURRICULA. OUR COURSE FOCUSING ON COMPUTING AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION FOR POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLARS FROM A NON-COMPUTING BACKGROUND DEMONSTRATES A PROMISING MODEL FOR INCORPORATING COMPUTING EDUCATION IN OTHER AREAS OF STUDY THAT DO NOT TRADITIONALLY HAVE A FOCUS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION AS WELL AS IN CONTINUING EDUCATION. © 2022 IEEE.",COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION; CONTINUING EDUCATION; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; INTERDISCIPLINARY COMPUTING EDUCATION,CLASSIFICATION (OF INFORMATION); CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS; CURRICULA; DATA SCIENCE; EDUCATION COMPUTING; HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGES; PRECIPITATION (METEOROLOGY); UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING; COMPUTATIONAL THINKINGS; COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION; COMPUTING EDUCATION; CONTINUING EDUCATION; CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; INTERDISCIPLINARY COMPUTING EDUCATION; INTRODUCTORY COURSE; POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS; SCIENCE EDUCATION; LARGE DATASET,,,"PROVOST, F., FAWCETT, T., DATA SCIENCE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO BIG DATA AND DATA-DRIVEN DECISION MAKING (2013) BIG DATA, 1 (1), PP. 51-59. , HTTPS://WWW.LIEBERTPUB.COM/DOI/FULL/10.1089/BIG.2013.1508, MAR, PUBLISHER: MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC., PUBLISHERS; FRANKLIN, D., PUTTING THE COMPUTER SCIENCE IN COMPUTING EDUCATION RESEARCH (2015) COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM, 58 (2), PP. 34-36. , HTTPS://DL.ACM.ORG/DOI/10.1145/2700376, JAN; (2006) CATALYZING INQUIRY AT THE INTERFACE OF COMPUTING AND BIOLOGY, , N.

HENCE, IT IS NECESSARY TO DESIGN EFFICIENT EDUCATION TECHNIQUES TO RAPIDLY TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF STUDENTS. WE DESCRIBE A HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT INTEGRATES MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES WITHIN A SINGLE SEMESTER COURSE TAUGHT AT THE FIRST YEAR LEVEL. THE OBJECTIVES INCLUDE BASIC DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, TEAMWORK, AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT. WE CONDUCTED A PROJECT THAT COMBINED DIFFERENT PUBLIC DATASETS RELATED TO THE COST AND QUALITY OF EDUCATION IN THE US. STUDENTS DEMONSTRATED A HIGH DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT IN THIS EXERCISE AS THEY WERE CURIOUS TO EXPLORE DATA THAT RELATED TO THEIR OWN COLLEGE SELECTION PROCESS. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO PERFORM A COST-QUALITY ANALYSIS IN THE FIELD OF COLLEGE EDUCATION.WE USED COLLEGE RANKING DATA CREATED BY THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, AND COMBINED IT WITH DATA FROM THE INTEGRATED POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION DATA SYSTEM DATABASE (HTTPS://NCES.ED.GOV/IPEDS/) THAT PROVIDED COLLEGE COSTS AND GRADUATION DATA. STUDENTS WORKED IN TEAMS TO DOWNLOAD SECTIONS OF THE DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, PERFORMED CLEANING AND VERIFICATION, AND MERGED THE DATA FOR ANALYSIS. THIS TAUGHT THEM THE VALUES OF TEAMWORK, GOAL-SETTING, AND PROCESS MEASUREMENT FOR TIMELY PROJECT COMPLETION.WE DETERMINED THAT THE PEARSON CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RANK OF A COLLEGE AND IN-STATE TUITION WAS-0.65 (P<0.005) FOR PRIVATE COLLEGES, AND-0.34 (P<0.005) FOR PUBLIC COLLEGES. THIS INDICATES THAT HIGHER RANKED COLLEGES TEND TO CHARGE HIGHER TUITION. THE PEARSON CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RANK OF ALL COLLEGES AND THEIR GRADUATION RATES IS-0.75 (P<0.005), AND BETWEEN RANK AND RETENTION RATES IS-0.71 (P<0.005). PRIVATE COLLEGE TUITION IS TYPICALLY $40,000 ANNUALLY, WHEREAS PUBLIC COLLEGES COST $20,000. THESE FIGURES SUGGEST THAT PUBLIC COLLEGES PROVIDE GOOD VALUE.

IT IS FORECAST THAT 75% OF ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS WILL USE AI, MACHINE LEARNING OR DEEP LEARNING TECHNOLOGY BY 2021, YET UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS COMMONLY PLACE THE BURDEN ON STUDENTS TO OBTAIN THEIR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATIONS THROUGH ELECTIVE COURSEWORK SPANNING MULTIPLE DISPARATE DEPARTMENTS. DATA SCIENCE REQUIRES SPECIFIC MATHEMATICS PREPARATION ESPECIALLY FOR CYBERSECURITY STUDENTS WHOSE PROGRAMS HAVE REDUCED THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVANCE MATHEMATICS TO A BARE MINIMUM. TO FACILITATE CURRICULA PREPARATION, AND HANDS-ON USAGE OF AI TOOLS, A NOTEBOOK ('A TRELLIS FOR NOVICE AI PRACTITIONERS') WAS PREPARED IN THE R PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AS A FIRST STEP IN INTRODUCING COMPUTER SCIENCE AND CYBERSECURITY STUDENTS TO THE CONCEPTS AND CAPABILITIES OF AI. A FOCUS ON AN INTRUSION DETECTION DATA SET TO MITIGATE NINE COMMON CYBER VULNERABILITIES IS USED IN THIS ANALYSIS. TRELLIS BRIDGES THE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL CHASM FOR STUDENTS BY BUILDING AN ANN NETWORK INTRUSION PREDICTIVE MODEL FROM SCRATCH.

DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION NEEDS TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE MEANS TO KEEP UP WITH THIS EXPANSION THAT FOCUS LESS ON PROFICIENCY IN SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES, BUT RATHER INTRODUCE NOVICES TO AUTHENTIC DATA PRACTICES, AND THE AUTHENTIC PURPOSES DIRECTING THE AUTHENTIC PRACTICES. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON A SPECIFIC PRACTICE, THE USE OF SIMULATIONS TO GENERATE AND EXAMINE DATA, IN THE CONTEXT OF AUTHENTIC SCIENTIFIC CITIZEN SCIENCE RESEARCH. WE PROVIDE A CASE STUDY OF ONE PAIR OF MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS' ENGAGEMENT IN AN EXTENDED LEARNING SEQUENCE INCLUDING SIMULATION ACTIVITIES INSPIRED BY AUTHENTIC DATA PRACTICES, ADAPTED TO ALSO BE AUTHENTIC FOR YOUNG STUDENTS. WHILE THE SIMULATION ACTIVITY WAS INSPIRED BY THE SCIENTISTS' PURPOSES, OUR FINDINGS ILLUSTRATE FOUR DIFFERENT ACTUAL PURPOSES THE STUDENTS ATTRIBUTED TO IT. WE ALSO SHOW THAT AS THE STUDENTS DEEPENED THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE SIMULATION, THEY GRADUALLY APPROPRIATED ITS INTENDED PURPOSE, ALONGSIDE ARTICULATING MORE MATURE VIEWS OF DATA-RELATED CONCEPTS. THE CONCLUSIONS SUMMARIZE THE FOUR DIFFERENT PURPOSES THE STUDENTS EXPRESSED AND IDENTIFY ASPECTS OF DESIGN THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE GRADUAL RE-SHAPING PROCESS OF THEIR ACTUAL PURPOSES. PRACTITIONER NOTES WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC INTRODUCING STUDENTS TO DATA SCIENCE AND STATISTICS HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL NOWADAYS. STUDENTS NEED TO BE INTRODUCED TO AUTHENTIC DATA PRACTICES, BUT ALSO TO THE AUTHENTIC PURPOSES MOTIVATING THESE PRACTICES. UTILIZING COMPUTERIZED SIMULATIONS IS A COMMON AUTHENTIC PRACTICE IN SCIENCE AND STATISTICS. THE PEDAGOGICAL, INTENDED, USE OF COMPUTERIZED SIMULATIONS CAN BE INSPIRED BY THE AUTHENTIC PURPOSES BUT SHOULD ALSO BE ADAPTED TO BE AUTHENTIC FOR THE STUDENTS. STUDENTS MAY HAVE ACTUAL PURPOSES THAT DIFFER FROM THE AUTHENTIC AND INTENDED PURPOSES. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS A CASE STUDY OF A PAIR OF MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS' ENGAGEMENT WITH A COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION TOOL, AS PART OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN A CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECT. THE STUDENTS EXPRESSED FOUR ACTUAL PURPOSES FOR THE SIMULATION. THE STUDENTS' INITIAL PURPOSES DIFFERED FROM THE INTENDED PURPOSES, LIMITING THEIR PARTICIPATION. KEY ASPECTS OF THE OVERALL ACTIVITY DESIGN ULTIMATELY SUPPORTED THE STUDENTS TO APPROPRIATE THE INTENDED PURPOSE OF THE SIMULATION AND MORE DEEPLY ENGAGE WITH THE INTENDED STATISTICAL NOTIONS. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND/OR POLICY IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT STUDENTS MAY ATTRIBUTE PURPOSES THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE OF THE TEACHER OR THE ACTIVITY DESIGNER, TO ANY LEARNING ACTIVITY THEY ENGAGE IN. MAKING THE INTENDED PURPOSES MORE EXPLICIT MAY BE HELPFUL, BUT POTENTIALLY NOT ENOUGH FOR STUDENTS TO APPROPRIATE THEM. RESEARCHERS' PROMPTS, STUDENTS' FREEDOM TO RESHAPE THEIR USE OF THE SIMULATION TOOL AND PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION NORMS CAN BE BENEFICIAL ASPECTS.",AUTHENTICITY; COMPUTERIZED-SIMULATIONS; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY; PURPOSES,NA,AZRIELI FOUNDATION; ISRAEL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [2678/17],"AZRIELI FOUNDATION; ISRAEL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: 2678/17","AHRWEILER P., 1998, COMPUTER SIMULATIONS, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-58270-7_3, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-58270-7_3;AINLEY J, 2006, BRIT EDUC RES J, V32, P23, DOI 10.1080/01411920500401971;ARCAVI A., 2003, EDUC STUD MATH, V52, P215, DOI 10.1023/A:1024312321077, DOI 10.1023/A:1024312321077;ARIDOR K., 2019, TOPICS TRENDS CURREN, P71, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-03472-6_4, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-03472-6_4;BAKKER A., 2004, DESIGN RES STAT ED S;BINDER K, 1995, MONTE CARLO MOL DYNA;BRAHAM H.M., 2017, STAT ED RES J, V16, P116, DOI 10.52041/SERJ.V16I2.187, DOI 10.52041/SERJ.V16I2.187;BUDGETT S, 2018, ZDM-MATH EDUC, V50, P1281, DOI 10.1007/S11858-018-0957-X;COBB G.

DATA FEMINISM IS AN APPROACH THAT DRAWS ON FEMINIST SCHOLARSHIP AND ACTION TO HUMANIZE DATA AND CONTEND WITH THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DATA AND POWER. IN THIS REVIEW PAPER, WE DRAW ON PRINCIPLES FROM DATA FEMINISM TO REVIEW 42 DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND DESIGN APPROACHES THAT ENGAGE YOUTH WITH DATA, MANY OF WHICH ARE EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY INTENSIVE AND BEAR ON FUTURE DATA-INTENSIVE EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DESIGN PROJECTS. WE DESCRIBE HOW THE PROJECTS ENGAGE STUDENTS WITH EXAMINING POWER, CHALLENGING POWER, ELEVATING EMOTION AND LIVED EXPERIENCE, RETHINKING BINARIES AND HIERARCHIES, EMBRACING PLURALISM, CONSIDERING CONTEXT, AND MAKING LABOUR VISIBLE. IN DOING SO, WE ARTICULATE WAYS THAT CURRENT DATA EDUCATION INITIATIVES INVOLVE YOUTH IN THINKING ABOUT ISSUES OF JUSTICE AND INCLUSION. THESE PROJECTS MAY OFFER EXAMPLES OF VARYING COMPLEXITY FOR FUTURE WORK TO CONTEND WITH AND, IDEALLY, EXTEND IN ORDER TO FURTHER REALIZE DATA FEMINISM IN K-12 DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. PRACTITIONER NOTES WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC DATA FEMINISM IS AN EMERGENT FRAMEWORK FOR CHANGING DATA PRACTICES AND DISCOURSE IN SERVICE OF EQUITY AND JUSTICE. DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IS RAPIDLY GROWING AS A TOPIC OF INTEREST IN THE EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DESIGN COMMUNITIES. MANY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN PROJECTS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED AND SHARED IN PUBLICATIONS THAT PRECEDED THE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION OF THE DATA FEMINISM FRAMEWORK. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS DATA FEMINISM IS PARTIALLY RE-ARTICULATED IN TERMS FAMILIAR TO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH COMMUNITIES. PRIOR AND RECENT PROJECTS ARE ORGANIZED WITH RESPECT TO HOW THEY ILLUSTRATE POTENTIAL CONNECTIONS TO CORE DATA FEMINISM PRINCIPLES. THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES SPECIFIC STRATEGIES THAT RECENT PROJECTS HAVE USED THAT HAVE POTENTIAL FOR REALIZING DATA FEMINISM PRINCIPLES. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND/OR POLICY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGISTS CAN USE THE RE-ARTICULATED PRINCIPLES OF DATA FEMINISM FOR EDUCATION TO INFORM THEIR FUTURE DESIGN WORK. TRACTABLE STEPS TO ACHIEVE DATA JUSTICE THAT ARE ATTAINABLE WITHIN EXISTING EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS CAN BE PURSUED.

THE RADICAL GROWTH IN RECENT YEARS IN THE AVAILABILITY OF DATA AND OF THE COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES REQUIRED TO PROCESS THEM, HAS LED TO A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR DATA SCIENTISTS. AS A RESULT, NEW DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE OPENING AT A GROWING RATE. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, SEVERAL PAPERS ON DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS WERE PUBLISHED, FOCUSING ON THEIR CURRICULAR ASPECTS. THE PEDAGOGY OF THOSE PROGRAMS, HOWEVER, HAS RECEIVED ONLY LITTLE ATTENTION. TO PARTIALLY CLOSE THIS GAP, MY DOCTORAL RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE PEDAGOGICAL ASPECTS OF DATA SCIENCE. THE PILOT PHASE OF THE RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT IN GRADUATE, UNDERGRADUATE, AND HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS. THE RESULTS OF THE PILOT RESEARCH ARE ORGANIZED BY A FRAMEWORK OF TEN CHALLENGES OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PEDAGOGICAL CHALLENGES OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION FOR VARIOUS POPULATIONS AND TO DEVELOP PEDAGOGICAL METHODS FOR COPING WITH THEM.

AS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE IT INTEGRATES KNOWLEDGE AND METHODS FROM COMPUTER SCIENCE, MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS, AND THE DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE OF THE DATA. AS DATA SCIENCE IS STILL FORMING AS A DOMAIN, SEVERAL POINTS OF VIEW EXIST ON HOW TO TEACH DATA SCIENCE. THE CURRICULUM OF MANY UNDERGRADUATE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS INCLUDES ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN MATHEMATICS, STATISTICS, COMPUTER SCIENCE, AND ONE OR MORE DATA DOMAINS. SEVERAL INITIATIVES FOR DESIGNING HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE CURRICULA HAVE EMERGED RECENTLY. SINCE IT IS UNREALISTIC TO TEACH ALL THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ADVANCED TOPICS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL, THE HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM FOCUSES ON A BROAD UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW RATHER THAN ON MATHEMATICAL AND ALGORITHMIC DETAILS THAT CHARACTERIZE UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS. HIGH SCHOOL COMPUTER SCIENCE PUPILS, HOWEVER, ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF ALGORITHMS, AS ALGORITHMS ARE THE HEART OF COMPUTER SCIENCE. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT OUR ATTEMPT TO ADAPT A DATA SCIENCE COURSE TO COMPUTER SCIENCE HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS THAT INCORPORATES BOTH A BROAD VIEW ON DATA SCIENCE AND DATA WORKFLOW, AS WELL AS DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF DATA PROCESSING ALGORITHMS AND SPECIFICALLY, MACHINE LEARNING. THIS COURSE IS TAUGHT FOR 10TH GRADE COMPUTER SCIENCE PUPILS IN AN ISRAELI PUBLIC SCHOOL, AND WAS ALSO TAUGHT IN A SUMMER WORKSHOP FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS. © 2020 ACM.",COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; HIGH SCHOOL; INTERDISCIPLINARY; K12; SECONDARY EDUCATION,CURRICULA; DATA HANDLING; ENGINEERING EDUCATION; EQUALIZERS; MACHINE LEARNING; TEACHING; COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS; DATA PROCESSING ALGORITHMS; DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE; INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELDS; SCIENCE CURRICULUM; SCIENCE PROGRAMS; SUMMER WORKSHOPS; UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM; DATA SCIENCE,,,"ANDERSON, P., BOWRING, J., MCCAULEY, R., POTHERING, G., STARR, C., AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN DATA SCIENCE: CURRICULUM AND A DECADE OF IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE (2014) PROCEEDINGS OF THE 45TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, PP. 145-150. , ACM NEW YORK, NY, USA; BERMAN, F., RUTENBAR, R., HAILPERN, B., CHRISTENSEN, H., DAVIDSON, S., ESTRIN, D., FRANKLIN, M., STODDEN, V., REALIZING THE POTENTIAL OF DATA SCIENCE (2018) COMMUN.

THROUGH THESE METRICS, WE EXAMINED THE CODE SUBMISSIONS OF 97 STUDENTS ACROSS TWO SEMESTERS OF AN INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE COURSE. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE METRICS CAN IDENTIFY CASES WHERE STUDENTS HAD OVERLY COMPLICATED CODES AND WOULD BENEFIT FROM SCAFFOLDING FEEDBACK. THE NUMBER OF LIBRARY CALLS, IN PARTICULAR, WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF CHANGES IN SUBMISSION SCORE AND SUBMISSION RUNTIME, WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE DISTINCTIVE NATURE OF DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMING.

IN RECENT YEARS, MACHINE LEARNING (ML) 'S SURGING IMPACT HAS SPARKED DISCOURSE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF AI EDUCATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, AND IN RECENT YEARS, SEVERAL INITIATIVES AND PROJECTS PURSUING THE MISSION OF K-12 AI EDUCATION HAVE EMERGED. IN 2020 ISRAEL'S MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (MOE) APPROVED A NEW COMPREHENSIVE AND RIGOROUS ML CURRICULUM TARGETING 11 AND 12TH-GRADE PUPILS MAJORING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (CS). THE CURRICULUM IS MEANT TO BE TAUGHT BY THE EXISTING CS TEACHER WORKFORCE. HOWEVER, SINCE ML THEORY AND PRACTICE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL CS [2], IMPLEMENTING THIS THOROUGH ML CURRICULUM POSES SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGES IN DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE TEACHING WORKFORCE TO DELIVER IT. IN THIS RESEARCH, WE SUGGEST A SOLUTION FOR THIS CHALLENGE IN THE FORM OF A BLENDED-LEARNING (BL) PROGRAM. THE ONLINE COMPONENT OF THIS PROGRAM IS BASED MAINLY ON COURSERA'S DEEP LEARNING SPECIALIZATION MOOCS SERIES [3]. THE BL PROGRAM, ENHANCED WITH PEDAGOGICAL TRAINING, IS ALSO USED FOR THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (PD) OF THE TEACHERS WHO DELIVER THE PROGRAM. OUT OF FOURTEEN CS TEACHERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE PD IN THE SUMMER OF 2021, TEN TEACH THE BL PROGRAM THIS YEAR TO 273 HIGH-SCHOOL PUPILS.

RECENT EFFORTS TO PROMOTE REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH MAINLY FOCUSED ON MATURED SCIENTISTS AND MUCH LESS ON STUDENT TRAINING. IN THIS STUDY, WE CONDUCTED ACTION RESEARCH ON STUDENTS IN DATA SCIENCE TO EVALUATE TO WHAT EXTENT STUDENTS ARE READY FOR COMMUNICATING REPRODUCIBLE DATA ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ALTHOUGH TWO-THIRDS OF THE STUDENTS CLAIMED THEY WERE ABLE TO REPRODUCE RESULTS IN PEER REPORTS, ONLY ONE-THIRD OF REPORTS PROVIDED ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION FOR REPLICATION. THE ACTUAL REPLICATION RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE CONFLICTING CLAIMS; SOME LACKED COMPARISONS OF ORIGINAL AND REPLICATION RESULTS, INDICATING THAT SOME STUDENTS DID NOT SHARE A CONSISTENT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT REPRODUCIBILITY MEANS AND HOW TO REPORT REPLICATION RESULTS.

THUS, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO REVEAL THE REALITY OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND TO DETERMINE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR TEACHING DATA SCIENCE IN THE REGION. THIRTEEN COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST WERE OFFERING 48 DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMES AT THE TIME OF THE STUDY. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT THESE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMES SIGNIFICANTLY USE THE WORDS 'DATA' AND 'ANALYTICS' IN THEIR NAMES. WITH REGARD TO THE ACADEMIC AFFILIATIONS OF THE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMES, THE STUDY FOUND THAT THEY ARE OFFERED IN A VARIETY OF SCHOOLS, ESPECIALLY COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS. MOREOVER, THE STUDY FOUND THAT COMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE DOMINANT TREND IN THE PROGRAMMES. DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP WITH OTHER PROGRAMMES, ESPECIALLY STATISTICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE, BECAUSE OF THE INTERDISCIPLINARY NATURE OF THIS FIELD.

THIS WORK DEPICTS THE INTERDISCIPLINARY LANDSCAPE OF ISCHOOLS FROM RESEARCH OUTCOMES PUBLICATION KNOWLEDGE  DIFFUSION INPUT REFERENCE OUTPUT CITATION AND SCHOOL LEVEL BASED ON THE WOS PUBLICATIONS OF 36 ICAUCUS MEMBERS IN ISCHOOLS FROM 2009 TO 2018. INTERDISCIPLINARITY IS MEASURED BY THREE INDICATORS NAMELY VARIETY BALANCE AND INTENSITY. WE FOUND THAT 1 THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERISTICS OF RESEARCH OUTCOMES ARE HIGH SUBJECT VARIETY AND HIGH SUBJECT IMBALANCE. FIRSTLY THE PAPERS PUBLISHED BY ISCHOOLS INCLUDE 227 DISCIPLINES COVERING 89. 37% OF THE WOS SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION THE NUMBER OF DISCIPLINES INVOLVED IN THE PAPERS IS GENERALLY INCREASING. SECONDLY THE PUBLICATIONS ARE RELATIVELY CONCENTRATED ON A FEW DISCIPLINES SUCH AS LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE. IN ADDITION THE OVERALL INTERDISCIPLINARY INTENSITY OF RESEARCH OUTCOMES IS 56. 81% WHICH MEANS 56. 81% OF PUBLICATIONS INVOLVED TWO OR MORE DISCIPLINES REFLECTING THEIR MULTIDISCIPLINARY NATURE. 2 THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERISTICS OF KNOWLEDGE DIFFUSION ARE HIGH SUBJECT VARIETY AND RELATIVELY HIGH SUBJECT IMBALANCE. FIRSTLY KNOWLEDGE INPUT AND KNOWLEDGE OUTPUT COVER AROUND 254 WOS SUBJECT CLASSIFICATIONS WHICH SHOWS RESEARCHES OF ISCHOOLS ARE RELATIVELY OPEN. SECONDLY ACCORDING TO THE CUMULATIVE PERCENTAGE OF THE DISCIPLINARY DISTRIBUTION THE TOP TEN DISCIPLINES IN KNOWLEDGE INPUT AND OUTPUT HAVE RESPECTIVELY REACHED 44% AND 46% INDICATING THE RELATIVE CONCENTRATION OF KNOWLEDGE DIFFUSION. IN ADDITION THE INTERDISCIPLINARY INTENSITY OF KNOWLEDGE INPUT IS 54. 71% INDICATING THAT ISCHOOLS HAVE CITED MANY PAPERS FROM OTHER DISCIPLINES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT IS MAINLY RELATED TO THE CROSS-BORDER INTEGRATION OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE. THE INTERDISCIPLINARY INTENSITY OF KNOWLEDGE OUTPUT IS 55. 11% WHICH INDICATES THAT ISCHOOLS PAPERS HAVE BEEN WIDELY CITED BY PAPERS FROM OTHER DISCIPLINES AND ISCHOOLS HAVE FORMED A STRONG CAPACITY TO OUTPUT AND TO INFILTRATE KNOWLEDGE TO OTHER DISCIPLINES. 3 THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERISTICS OF ISCHOOLS MEMBERS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. THE INTERDISCIPLINARY DIVERSITY OF UC IRVINE CORNELL UNIVERSITY AND MONASH UNIVERSITY ARE AT THE FOREFRONT WHILE THE INTERDISCIPLINARY DIVERSITY OF HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY AND RENMIN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA LAG BEHIND. UC IRVINE AND CORNELL UNIVERSITY PUBLISH VERY LOW PERCENTAGES OF PAPERS IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION  SCIENCE. ACCORDING TO THE FACTOR ANALYSIS OF RESEARCH OUTCOMES KNOWLEDGE INPUT AND KNOWLEDGE OUTPUT 36 COLLEGES CAN BE DIVIDED INTO SIX CATEGORIES LIBRARY INFORMATION COMPUTER SCIENCE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION RESEARCH COMMUNICATION AND MANAGEMENT. THE NUMBER OF COLLEGES IN THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CATEGORY IS THE LARGEST. 4 LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IS CLOSELY RELATED TO IFIELD BUT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ALSO EXIST. LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IS THE SUBJECT WITH THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF RESEARCH OUTPUTS AND THE MOST IMPORTANT SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE IFIELD. BUT THE PROPORTION IS NOT HIGH WITH 22. 87% IN RESEARCH OUTCOMES 13. 05% IN REFERENCE AND 8. 88% IN CITED PAPER. IT ALSO INDICATES A DOWNWARD TREND OVER TIME. THE TENDENCY OF ISCHOOLS TO ELIMINATE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IS OBVIOUS. IN ADDITION THOUGH MANY COLLEGES ARE CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE SUBJECT MANY OF THEM HAVE A CLEAR TREND OF DIVERSIFICATION. THERE ARE SEVERAL LIMITATIONS IN THIS STUDY. TAKING THE ICAUCUS MEMBER AS AN EXAMPLE TO EXPLORE THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERISTICS OF ISCHOOLS RESEARCHES THE GENERALIZABILITY OF ITS CONCLUSIONS NEEDS TO BE FURTHER VERIFIED. SECOND IN ADDITION TO THE DIVERSITY BALANCE AND INTENSITY COMBINING WITH MORE COMPREHENSIVE INDICATORS MAY MAKE THE CONCLUSION MORE CREDIBLE AND COMPLETE. FINALLY THE SAMPLE DATA FROM WOS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO IMPLEMENT A THOROUGH BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS. 4 FIGS. 7 TABS. 56 REFS. © 2020, EDITORIAL OFFICE OF JOURNAL OF LIBRARY SCIENCE IN CHINA.

ALTHOUGH EXTRACURRICULAR EFFORTS ALREADY EXIST FOR MANY COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE DISCIPLINES, THEIR SUPPORT OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HELPED IN COPING WITH THE SPEED OF INNOVATION IN DATA SCIENCE PRACTICE AND FORMAL CURRICULA. WHILE THE PROLIFERATION OF AD HOC EFFORTS IS AN INDICATION OF THEIR POPULARITY, LESS HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED ABOUT THE NEEDS THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED TO MEET, THE LIMITATIONS THAT THEY FACE, AND PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR HOLDING SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS. TO HOLISTICALLY UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF DIFFERENT AD HOC FORMATS FOR DATA SCIENCE, WE SURVEYED ORGANIZERS OF AD HOC DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW ORGANIZERS PERCEIVED THE EVENTS TO HAVE GONE-INCLUDING AREAS OF STRENGTH AND AREAS REQUIRING GROWTH. WE ALSO GATHERED RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THESE PAST EVENTS FOR FUTURE ORGANIZERS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF AD HOC EFFORTS GO BEYOND DEVELOPING TECHNICAL SKILLS AND MAY PROVIDE CONTINUED BENEFIT IN CONJUNCTION WITH FORMAL CURRICULA, WHICH WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION. AS INCREASING NUMBERS OF RESEARCHERS FROM COMPUTATIONAL FIELDS WITH A HISTORY OF COMPLEX DATA BECOME INVOLVED WITH AD HOC EFFORTS TO SHARE THEIR SKILLS, THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE EXTRACT FROM THE SURVEYS WILL PROVIDE CONCRETE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE PRACTITIONER-LEADERS INTERESTED IN CREATING, IMPROVING, AND SUSTAINING FUTURE EFFORTS. AUTHOR SUMMARY LARGE DATASETS ARE BECOMING INTEGRAL TO SOCIETY BROADLY AND TO BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES IN PARTICULAR. AS A RESULT, DEMAND FOR SOPHISTICATED DATA SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE HAS SKYROCKETED AND LEFT SOME INDIVIDUALS SCRAMBLING TO CROSS-TRAIN AND ACQUIRE MORE COMPUTATIONAL SKILLS. WHILE UNIVERSITIES ARE RACING TO DEVELOP FORMAL CURRICULA TO MEET THIS DEMAND, DIVERSE INFORMAL EFFORTS HAVE EMERGED TO FILL THE IMMEDIATE DEMAND FOR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE. THESE ""AD HOC"" EFFORTS HAVE BEEN PLAYING A VITAL ROLE IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, ESPECIALLY FOR DOMAIN SCIENTISTS. WHILE SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN SPECIFIC AD HOC FORMATS TO HAVE CONSIDERABLE IMPACT, FEW STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THESE EFFORTS HOLISTICALLY. HERE, WE SURVEY EFFORT ORGANIZERS FROM LEADING DATA SCIENCE INSTITUTES AND COLLECT LESSONS LEARNED. WE FIND THAT EFFORTS ARE COMMONLY REPORTED TO SUCCESSFULLY PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES IN DIFFICULT AREAS WHERE CURRICULA COULD IMPROVE, SUCH AS PROVIDING APPROACHABLE INTRODUCTIONS TO NEW SKILLS, INCREASING DIVERSITY OF BACKGROUNDS, AND FOSTERING HETEROGENEOUS COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER, EFFORTS ALSO REPORT CHALLENGES FULFILLING DIVERSE NEEDS AND OFFER SUGGESTIONS. IN TOTAL, THE LESSONS THAT WE COLLECT FROM THESE EFFORTS ARE USEFUL TO IMPROVE FUTURE AD HOC EFFORTS AND TO INFORM FORMAL PROGRAMS, WHICH MAY BE LOOKING FOR INSPIRATION TO DESIGN INNOVATIVE EDUCATIONAL FORMATS.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ALLEN G, 2011, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V4, P1927, DOI 10.1016/J.PROCS.2011.04.210;ANONYMOUS, 2018, TOXICOL ANAL CLIN, V30, P1, DOI DOI 10.19501/J.CNKI.1006-2009.20181109.001;ANONYMOUS, 2018, DIABETES CARE S1, V4, PS4, DOI 10.2337/DC18-SREV01;ANONYMOUS, 2018, J CANC RES THER, V14, PS622;ARANDA J, 2012, SOFTWARE CARPENTRY A;ATWOOD TK, 2015, PLOS COMPUT BIOL, V11, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1004143;BATUT B, 2018, BIORXIV, P225680;BAUMER B, 2015, AM STAT, V69, P334, DOI 10.1080/00031305.2015.1081105;BUDD A, 2015, PLOS COMPUT BIOL, V11, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1003905;CAO LB, 2017, ACM COMPUT SURV, V50, DOI 10.1145/3076253;CETINKAYA-RUNDEL M, 2018, AM STAT, V72, P58, DOI 10.1080/00031305.2017.1397549;CHANDRA Y., 2019, QUALITATIVE RES USIN;CLARK D, 2014, SCIPY 2014, P5;CORBIN J, 1990, Z SOZIOL, V19, P418, DOI 10.1007/BF00988593;DEVENYI GA, 2018, PLOS COMPUT BIOL, V14, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1005963;FELDON DF, 2017, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V114, P9854, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.1705783114;GRAZIOTIN D, 2017, 2017 IEEE/ACM 2ND INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON EMOTION AWARENESS IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (SEMOTION 2017), P42, DOI 10.1109/SEMOTION.2017.5;GUTLERNER JL, 2013, CELL, V153, P731, DOI 10.1016/J.CELL.2013.04.027;HILL BM, 2017, COMPUT SOC SCI, P115, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-59186-5_9;HOLDGRAF C., 2017, P PRACT EXP ADV RES, P1;HUPPENKOTHEN D, 2018, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V115, P8872, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.1717196115;JACOBS C.

THESE NEW TRENDS IMPACT THE SOCIETY AND FUTURE JOBS, AND THUS STUDENT CAREERS. AT THE HEART OF THIS DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IS DATA SCIENCE, THE DISCIPLINE THAT MAKES SENSE OF BIG DATA. WITH MANY RAPIDLY EMERGING DIGITAL CHALLENGES AHEAD OF US, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES PERSPECTIVES ON ISCHOOLS' OPPORTUNITIES AND SUGGESTIONS IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. WE ARGUE THAT ISCHOOLS SHOULD EMPOWER THEIR STUDENTS WITH ""INFORMATION COMPUTING"" DISCIPLINES, WHICH WE DEFINE AS THE ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND CREATE VALUES, INFORMATION, AND KNOWLEDGE USING TOOLS IN APPLICATION DOMAINS. AS SPECIFIC APPROACHES TO ENFORCING INFORMATION COMPUTING DISCIPLINES IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, WE SUGGEST THE THREE FOCI OF USER-BASED, TOOL-BASED, AND APPLICATION-BASED. THESE THREE FOCI WILL SERVE TO DIFFERENTIATE THE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION OF ISCHOOLS FROM THAT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE OR BUSINESS SCHOOLS. WE PRESENT A LAYERED DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION FRAMEWORK (DSEF) WITH BUILDING BLOCKS THAT INCLUDE THE THREE PILLARS OF DATA SCIENCE (PEOPLE, TECHNOLOGY, AND DATA), COMPUTATIONAL THINKING, DATA-DRIVEN PARADIGMS, AND DATA SCIENCE LIFECYCLES. DATA SCIENCE COURSES BUILT ON THE TOP OF THIS FRAMEWORK SHOULD THUS BE EXECUTED WITH USER-BASED, TOOL-BASED, AND APPLICATION-BASED APPROACHES. THIS FRAMEWORK WILL HELP OUR STUDENTS THINK ABOUT DATA SCIENCE PROBLEMS FROM THE BIG PICTURE PERSPECTIVE AND FOSTER APPROPRIATE PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS IN CONJUNCTION WITH BROAD PERSPECTIVES OF DATA SCIENCE LIFECYCLES.

IN THIS PAPER, WE DISCUSS THE CENTRALITY OF API (APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE) LOOKUP TO DATA WRANGLING, AND HOW AN ONTOLOGY-STRUCTURED COMMAND MENU COULD FACILITATE IT. WE DESIGN THUMBNAIL GRAPHICS AS VISUAL ALTERNATIVES TO EXPLAINING DATA WRANGLING OPERATIONS AND USE A SURVEY TO VALIDATE THEIR QUALITY. WE FURTHERMORE PREDICT THAT THUMBNAIL GRAPHICS MAKE THE MENU MORE NAVIGABLE, IMPROVING LOOKUP EFFICIENCY AND PERFORMANCE. OUR PREDICTIONS ARE TESTED USING SLICE N DICE, AN ONLINE DATA WRANGLING TUTORIAL PLATFORM THAT COLLECTS LEARNER ACTIVITY. IT INCLUDES BOTH NON-PROGRAMMATIC AND PROGRAMMATIC DATA WRANGLING EXERCISES. PARTICIPANTS FROM A MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL SAMPLE (N=200) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED THE TUTORIAL EITHER WITH OR WITHOUT THUMBNAIL GRAPHICS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THUMBNAIL GRAPHICS REDUCE THE NEED FOR CLARIFICATIONS, THEREBY ASSISTING API LOOKUP FOR NOVICES LEARNING DATA WRANGLING. WE FURTHER PRESENT SOME NEGATIVE RESULTS REGARDING PERFORMANCE GAIN AND FOLLOW UP WITH A DISCUSSION ON WHY THE DIFFERENCES ARE SUBTLE AND HOW THEY CAN BE IMPROVED.

THIS INTERPRETIVE STUDY EXAMINED MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS' UNDERSTANDING OF STATISTICAL CONCEPTS INVOLVED IN MAKING A PLAN TO COLLECT DATA TO ANSWER A STATISTICAL QUESTION WITHIN A SOCIAL ISSUE CONTEXT USING DATA AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET. STUDENT ARTIFACTS, RESEARCHER NOTES, AND AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDINGS FROM NINE GROUPS OF 20 SEVENTH-GRADE STUDENTS IN TWO GIFTED EDUCATION PULL-OUT CLASSES AT A SUBURBAN MIDDLE SCHOOL WERE USED TO ANSWER THE STUDY RESEARCH QUESTIONS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING A PRIORI CODES FROM PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED FRAMEWORKS AND BY USING AN INDUCTIVE APPROACH TO FIND THEMES. THREE THEMES THAT EMERGED FROM DATA RELATED TO CONFIRMATION BIAS. SOME MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS HELD PRECONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SOCIAL ISSUES THEY CHOSE TO STUDY THAT BIASED THEIR STATISTICAL QUESTIONS. THIS IN TURN INFLUENCED THE SOURCES OF DATA STUDENTS USED TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS. CONFIRMATION BIAS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT IS EXACERBATED DUE TO ENDLESS SOURCES OF DATA ELECTRONICALLY AVAILABLE.

DATA SCIENCE, INCLUDING MATHEMATICS, STATISTICS, BIG DATA, MACHINE LEARNING, AND DEEP LEARNING, CAN BE CONSIDERED AS THE INTERSECTION OF STATISTICS, MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE. ALTHOUGH THE DEBATE CONTINUES ABOUT THE CORE AREA OF DATA SCIENCE, THE SUBJECT IS A HUGE HIT. UNIVERSITIES HAVE A HIGH DEMAND FOR DATA SCIENCE. THEY ARE TRYING TO LIVE UP TO THIS DEMAND BY OPENING POSTGRADUATE AND DOCTORAL PROGRAMS. SINCE THE SUBJECT IS A NEW FIELD, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS GIVEN BY UNIVERSITIES IN DATA SCIENCE. BESIDES, SINCE THE SUBJECT IS CLOSE TO STATISTICS, MOST OF THE TIME, DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS ARE OPENED IN THE STATISTICS DEPARTMENTS, AND THIS ALSO CAUSES DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS.

THE ADOPTION OF DL IN HYDROLOGY HAS SO FAR BEEN GRADUAL, BUT THE FIELD IS NOW RIPE FOR BREAKTHROUGHS. THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT DLBASED METHODS CAN OPEN UP A COMPLEMENTARY AVENUE TOWARD KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES. IN THE NEW AVENUE, MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHMS PRESENT COMPETING HYPOTHESES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH DATA. INTERROGATIVE METHODS ARE THEN INVOKED TO INTERPRET DL MODELS FOR SCIENTISTS TO FURTHER EVALUATE. HOWEVER, HYDROLOGY PRESENTS MANY CHALLENGES FOR DL METHODS, SUCH AS DATA LIMITATIONS, HETEROGENEITY AND CO-EVOLUTION, AND THE GENERAL INEXPERIENCE OF THE HYDROLOGIC FIELD WITH DL. THE ROADMAP TOWARD DL-POWERED SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES WILL REQUIRE THE COORDINATED EFFORT FROM A LARGE COMMUNITY INVOLVING SCIENTISTS AND CITIZENS. INTEGRATING PROCESS-BASED MODELS WITH DL MODELS WILL HELP ALLEVIATE DATA LIMITATIONS. THE SHARING OF DATA AND BASELINE MODELS WILL IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. OPEN COMPETITIONS COULD SERVE AS THE ORGANIZING EVENTS TO GREATLY PROPEL GROWTH AND NURTURE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IN HYDROLOGY, WHICH DEMANDS A GRASSROOTS COLLABORATION.

TO DATE, THE RESEARCH ON THE IDS COURSE HAS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON PEDAGOGY, PROFESSIONAL LEARNING FOR TEACHERS, AND THE CURRICULUM. THIS MIXED-METHODS CASE STUDY EXPANDS OUR UNDERSTANDING BY ANALYZING THE PERSPECTIVE OF IDS STUDENTS AT A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL. SELFDETERMINATION THEORY PROVIDES A USEFUL FRAME FOR INTERPRETING HOW THESE STUDENTS EXPERIENCE THE IDS COURSE. THE THEORY FOCUSES ON CONDITIONS FOR STUDENTS TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL LEARNING: COMPETENCE (SELF-EFFICACY), AUTONOMY (AGENCY), AND RELATEDNESS (A SENSE OF BELONGING). THE FINDINGS FROM THIS CASE STUDY SUGGEST THE IDS STUDENTS FEEL CONFIDENT, EMPOWERED, AND PART OF A VIBRANT COMMUNITY, UNLIKE PREVIOUS MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS COURSES THEY MAY HAVE COMPLETED; AND USE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THEIR JOY IN PROBLEM-SOLVING AND THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE COURSE. THESE FINDINGS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND REFINEMENT OF ANY HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE COURSE, INCLUDING IDS. © 2022",DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS PATHWAYS; NON-TRADITIONAL HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS; STATISTICS EDUCATION RESEARCH,,,I WISH TO THANK MS.

NEW DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE BEING LAUNCHED AT AN INCREASING RATE, ARE DESIGNED FOR MULTIPLE EDUCATION LEVELS AND POPULATIONS. MACHINE LEARNING (ML) IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF DATA SCIENCE THAT REQUIRES AN EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND IN MATHEMATICS. WHEREAS IT IS POSSIBLE TO TEACH THE PRINCIPLES OF ML ONLY AS A BLACK BOX, NOVICE LEARNERS MIGHT FIND IT DIFFICULT TO IMPROVE AN ALGORITHM’S PERFORMANCE WITHOUT A WHITE BOX UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING ML ALGORITHMS. IN THIS PAPER, WE SUGGEST A PEDAGOGICAL METHOD, BASED ON HANDS-ON PEN-AND-PAPER TASKS, TO SUPPORT WHITE BOX UNDERSTANDING OF ML ALGORITHMS FOR LEARNERS WHO LACK THE LEVEL OF MATHEMATICS KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED FOR THIS PURPOSE. DATA WERE COLLECTED USING A COMPREHENSION QUESTIONNAIRE AND ANALYZED ACCORDING TO THE PROCESS-OBJECT THEORY BORROWED FROM MATHEMATICS EDUCATION RESEARCH. WE PRESENT EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS METHOD BASED ON DATA COLLECTED IN AN INTRODUCTION-LEVEL DATA SCIENCE COURSE FOR GRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS. THIS POPULATION HAD EXTENSIVE PSYCHOLOGY DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE, AS WELL AS AN ESTABLISHED BACKGROUND IN STATISTICS, BUT HAD GAPS IN MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE COMPARED WITH DATA SCIENCE MAJORS. THE RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION IS BOTH PRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL. PRACTICALLY, WE PRESENT A LEARNING MODULE THAT SUPPORTS NON-MAJOR DATA SCIENCE STUDENTS’ WHITE BOX UNDERSTANDING OF ML. THEORETICALLY, WE PROPOSE A DATA ANALYSIS METHOD TO EVALUATE STUDENTS’ CONCEPTIONS OF ML ALGORITHMS. © 2022",DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; MACHINE LEARNING; PROCESS-OBJECT DUALITY THEORY; STATISTICS EDUCATION RESEARCH,,"TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY, ТАУ; TECHNION-ISRAEL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY GENEROUS FUNDING FROM THE TECHNION’S MACHINE LEARNING & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (MLIS) CENTER.

THE TASK WAS CONSTRUCTED USING OUR DESIGN FRAMEWORK AND IMPLEMENTED WITHIN A FACE-TO-FACE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOP INVOLVING SIX HIGH SCHOOL STATISTICS TEACHERS. THE TEACHERS WERE GUIDED THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A PREDICTION MODEL USING: AN INFORMAL APPROACH; VISUAL PREDICTION INTERVALS; DATA ABOUT MOVIE RATINGS FROM AN API; AND R CODE THAT RAN IN THE BROWSER.

THIS EMERGENCE ALSO EXTENDS TO UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION, WHEREBY A GROWING NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS NOW OFFER DEGREE PROGRAMS IN DATA SCIENCE. HOWEVER, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE VARIATION IN WHAT THE FIELD ACTUALLY ENTAILS AND, BY EXTENSION, DIFFERENCES IN HOW UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS PREPARE STUDENTS FOR DATA-INTENSIVE CAREERS. WE USED TWO SEMINAL FRAMEWORKS FOR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION TO EVALUATE UNDERGRADUATE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS AT A SUBSET OF 4-YEAR INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES; DEVELOPING AND APPLYING A RUBRIC, WE ASSESSED HOW WELL EACH PROGRAM MET THE GUIDELINES OF EACH OF THE FRAMEWORKS. MOST PROGRAMS SCORED HIGH IN STATISTICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE AND LOW IN DOMAIN-SPECIFIC EDUCATION, ETHICS, AND AREAS OF COMMUNICATION. MOREOVER, THE ACADEMIC UNIT ADMINISTERING THE DEGREE PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED THE COURSE-LOAD DISTRIBUTION OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND STATISTICS/MATHEMATICS COURSES.
