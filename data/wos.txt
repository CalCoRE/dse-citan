AB The perceived importance of data in society has led to a surge in interest towards data science education. This article seeks to build on existing literature concerned with the sociopolitical, cultural, and ethical dimensions of data science education by considering the salience of two interrelated concepts discussed in Asian and Asian American studies and postcolonial studies: techno-Orientalism and the Filipino mimicry stereotype. These concepts describe the positioning of Asians and Asian Americans, and Filipinos in particular, as performance machines who are adept at copying the ideas of dominant groups but incapable of innovation themselves. This article situates techno-Orientalism and the Filipino mimicry stereotype within broader conversations around postcolonial data politics and then argues for the possibility of including these concepts in data science education curricula. Finally, this article discusses Gaskins's techno-vernacular creativity as one path for resisting techno-Orientalist and mimicry discourses.

AB In the first wave of data science education programs, data engineering topics (systems, scalable algorithms, data management, integration) tended to be de-emphasized in favor of machine learning and statistical modeling. The anecdotal evidence suggests this was a mistake: data scientists report spending most of their time grappling with data far upstream of modeling activities.
   A second wave of data science education is emerging, one with increased emphasis on practical issues in ethics, legal compliance, scientific reproducibility, data quality, and algorithmic bias. The data engineering community has a second chance to influence these programs beyond just providing a set of tools. In this panel, we'll discuss the role of data engineering in data science education programs, and how best to capitalize on emerging opportunities in this space.

AB Using the Conway model of data science education as a guide, this paper introduces a model for undergraduate data science education for information schools. The core idea of the suggested model is that data science programs in information schools are unique due to their particular substantive expertise, which includes data management, information behavior, and ethics. This paper also suggests that, to create a data science program within an information school, it may be useful to expand curriculums by adding programming, statistics, and machine learning requirements.

AB "Data Scientist" has often been considered as the sexiest job of the 21st century. As a consequence, the spectrum of data science education programs has increased significantly in recent years, and there is a high demand for data scientists at many companies. However, what training is required to become a data scientist? What is the role of data scientists in current enterprises? Is the training well-aligned to the practical needs of a job? In this article, we will address these questions by evaluating a survey of people who were trained in a continuing education program in data science in Switzerland. Our study sheds lights on the practical aspects of the data science education and how this newly-gained knowledge can successfully be applied in an enterprise. One of the highlights from the point of view of the database community is the important role of SQL in data science.

AB Undergraduate data science education is receiving increasing interest in many higher education institutions in the U.S., with the proliferation of data and data related work and research. As an emerging interdisciplinary study field, data science curriculum is typically a collection of individual data science related courses from different schools and departments, most of which are teaching data science in a siloed fashion. Therefore, it is necessary to map the landscape of existing curricula and explore how academic libraries can collaborate and contribute to undergraduate data science education. In this study, we analyzed teaching content and topics of over 100 data science related courses at Purdue University to map the landscape and explore roles of academic libraries to support data science education curriculum. Our results indicate most existing courses focused on ?hard-core? scientific analytic principles, such as computer science, statistics, and domain-specific skills. Courses of data-oriented skills, such as data management, data ethics, and data communications were limited across disciplines. In addition, data science courses were more likely targeting STEM students at upper levels (3rd and 4th year students). Academic libraries can enrich data science education efforts, by supporting credit courses, certificate programs, and other co-curricular activities to provide learning opportunities to all students, particularly 1st and 2nd year students and non-STEM majors.

In particular, we investigate how Smart Blockchain Badges can support learners that want to advance their careers in data science, by offering them personalised recommendations based on their learning achievements. This work aims at enhancing data science accreditation by introducing a robust system based on the Blockchain technology. Learners will benefit from a sophisticated, open and transparent accreditation system, as well as from receiving job recommendations that match their skills and can potentially progress their careers. As a result, this work contributes towards closing the data science skills gap by linking data science education to the industry.

AB Over the past two decades, data science or data analytics degree programs have begun to emerge, reflecting the world's demand for data specialists to make sense of the vast amounts of collected data in the sciences, engineering, business, and other domains. As degree creation has occurred mainly due to demand, ACM and other professional bodies have recently stepped in to provide curricular guidance. However, no shared global framework for data science as an academic discipline exists, making growth unfocused and driven by employer demands. More recently, the growth of artificial intelligence has also impacted data science programs.
   This working group builds on prior efforts and participant experiences to develop a global taxonomy of approaches to data science education and expectations for graduates of data science programs to think like data scientists.

AB Data science education is a new area in computer science that has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, currently, data science educators lack good tools and methodologies. In particular, they lack integrated tools through which their students can acquire hands-on software engineering experience. To address these problems, we designed and implemented DataLab, a web-based tool for data science education that integrates code, data and execution management into one system. The goal of DataLab is to provide a hands-on online lab environment to train students to have basic software engineering thinking and habits while maintaining a focus on the core data science contents. In this paper, we present the user-experience design and system-level implementation of DataLab. Further, we evaluate DataLab's performance through an in-classroom use case. Finally, using objective log-based learning behavior analysis and a subjective survey, we demonstrate DataLab's effectiveness.

AB The interest in data science is increasing in recent years. Data science, including mathematics, statistics, big data, machine learning, and deep learning, can be considered as the intersection of statistics, mathematics and computer science. Although the debate continues about the core area of data science, the subject is a huge hit. Universities have a high demand for data science. They are trying to live up to this demand by opening postgraduate and doctoral programs. Since the subject is a new field, there are significant differences between the programs given by universities in data science. Besides, since the subject is close to statistics, most of the time, data science programs are opened in the statistics departments, and this also causes differences between the programs. In this article, we will summarize the data science education developments in the world and in Turkey specifically and how data science education should be at the graduate level.

AB Over the last three decades, data have become ubiquitous and cheap. This transition has accelerated over the last five years and training in statistics, machine learning, and data analysis has struggled to keep up. In April 2014, we launched a program of nine courses, the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization, which has now had more than 4 million enrollments over the past five years. Here, the program is described and compared to standard data science curricula as they were organized in 2014 and 2015. We show that novel pedagogical and administrative decisions introduced in our program are now standard in online data science programs. The impact of the Data Science Specialization on data science education in the U.S. is also discussed. Finally, we conclude with some thoughts about the future of data science education in a data democratized world.

AB The demand for personalized learning experiences that cater to the unique needs of individual learners has increased with the emergence of data science. This paper investigates the potential use of ChatGPT, a generative AI tool, in providing personalized learning experiences for data science education, specifically focusing on Deep Learning. The paper presents a case study that applies the 5Es model to test personalized learning for students using ChatGPT. The study aims to answer the question of how educators can leverage ChatGPT in their pedagogy to enhance student learning, and whether ChatGPT can provide a better learning experience than traditional teaching methods. The paper also discusses the limitations faced during the study and the findings. The results suggest that ChatGPT can be a valuable resource for data science education, providing personalized and instant feedback to learners. However, ethical considerations such as the potential for biased or inaccurate responses and the need for transparency in AI-generated content should be carefully ad-dressed by educators. The study highlights ChatGPT's potential as a research tool for data science educators to investigate the effectiveness of AI in personalized learning experiences. Overall, this paper contributes to the ongoing dialogue on the role of AI in data science education and provides insights into how educators can utilize ChatGPT to enhance student learning and engagement.

AB The era of big data has arrived. Big data bring us the data-driven paradigm and enlighten us to challenge new classes of problems we were not able to solve in the past. We are beginning to see the impacts of big data in every aspect of our lives and society. We need a science that can address these big data problems. Data science is a new emerging discipline that was termed to address challenges that we are facing and going to face in the big data era. Thus, education in data science is the key to success, and we need concrete strategies and approaches to better educate future data scientists. In this paper, we discuss general concepts on big data, data science, and data scientists and show the results of an extensive survey on current data science education in United States. Finally, we propose various approaches that data science education should aim to accomplish.

AB One role of universities is to provide students with the practical knowledge necessary to address broad societal needs. The growing field of data science has the potential to address many of these needs, primarily due to recent efforts to collect large amounts of data related to social, environmental, and political issues. A challenge is that there exists a disconnect between these real-world issues and the course materials taught to university students. This gap is due in part to a lack of engagement between universities and their local communities, leaving students with few opportunities to work with datasets relevant to real-world problems. To address this disconnect, the authors have implemented a novel data science education and outreach program in which students acquire new knowledge and skills while creating positive social impact through community service. In this work, we outline this outreach program, the Michigan Data Science Team, and provide empirical evidence of positive educational and social impact.

AB The emerging field of Data Science has had a large impact on science and society. This has led to over a decade of calls to establish a corresponding field of Data Science Education. There is still a need, however, to more deeply conceptualize what a field of Data Science Education might entail in terms of scope, responsibility, and execution. This special issue explores how one distinguishing feature of Data Science-its focus on data collected from social and environmental contexts within which learners often find themselves deeply embedded-suggests serious implications for learning and education. The learning sciences is uniquely positioned to investigate how such contextual embeddings impact learners' engagement with data including conceptual, experiential, communal, racialized, spatial, and political dimensions. This special issue demonstrates the richly layered relationships learners build with data and reveals them to be not merely utilitarian mechanisms for learning about data, but a critical part of navigating data as social text and understanding Data Science as a discipline. Together, the contributions offer a vision of how the learning sciences can contribute to a more expansive, agentive and socially aware Data Science Education.

AB The significance of ethics in data science research has attracted considerable attention in recent years. While there is widespread agreement on the importance of teaching ethics within computing contexts, there is no clear method for its implementation and assessment. Studies focusing on methods for integrating ethics into data science courses reveal that students tend to neglect ethical concerns in their data analysis. Based on the data we collected from questionnaires distributed to undergraduate science and engineering students, this paper expands the discussion beyond human concerns and ethics in data science education. As we will show, students tend to neglect the context when attempting to solve data science questions. We argue that gaps in understanding the context relating to the data result in gaps in the analysis as well as in the interpretation of the data. Thus, we propose anthropological thinking as a pedagogy to overcome the context neglect. Placing the spotlight on the context promotes a holistic understanding of the phenomenon being analyzed, as it includes important considerations that do not necessarily fit the more commonly used term human concerns.

ID VIEWS; CONCEPTIONS
AB Biomedical data science education faces the challenge of preparing students for conducting rigorous research with increasingly complex and large datasets. At the same time, philosophers of science face the challenge of making their expertise accessible for scientists in such a way that it can improve everyday research practice. Here, we investigate the possibility of approaching these challenges together. In current and proposed approaches to biomedical data science education, we identify a dominant focus on only one aspect of conducting scientific research: understanding and using data, research methods, and statistical methods. We argue that this approach cannot solve biomedical data science's challenge and we propose to shift the focus to four other aspects of conducting research: making and justifying decisions in research design and implementation, explaining their epistemic and non-epistemic effects, balancing varying responsibilities, and reporting scientific research. Attending to these aspects requires learning on different dimensions than solely learning to apply techniques (first dimension). It also requires learning to make choices (second dimension) and to understand the rationale behind choices (third dimension). This could be fostered by integrating philosophical training in biomedical data science education. Furthermore, philosophical training fosters a fourth dimension of learning, namely, understanding the nature of science. In this article, we explain how we identified the five aspects of conducting research and the four dimensions of learning, and why attending to the fourth dimension is essential. We discuss educational approaches to attend to all aspects and dimensions, and present initial design principles to implement these approaches.

AB Due to the recent explosion of big data, our society has been rapidly going through digital transformation and entering a new world with numerous eye-opening developments. These new trends impact the society and future jobs, and thus student careers. At the heart of this digital transformation is data science, the discipline that makes sense of big data. With many rapidly emerging digital challenges ahead of us, this article discusses perspectives on iSchools' opportunities and suggestions in data science education. We argue that iSchools should empower their students with "information computing" disciplines, which we define as the ability to solve problems and create values, information, and knowledge using tools in application domains. As specific approaches to enforcing information computing disciplines in data science education, we suggest the three foci of user-based, tool-based, and application-based. These three foci will serve to differentiate the data science education of iSchools from that of computer science or business schools. We present a layered Data Science Education Framework (DSEF) with building blocks that include the three pillars of data science (people, technology, and data), computational thinking, data-driven paradigms, and data science lifecycles. Data science courses built on the top of this framework should thus be executed with user-based, tool-based, and application-based approaches. This framework will help our students think about data science problems from the big picture perspective and foster appropriate problem-solving skills in conjunction with broad perspectives of data science lifecycles. We hope the DSEF discussed in this article will help fellow iSchools in their design of new data science curricula.

AB The National Academies recommend academic institutions foster a basic understanding of data science in all undergraduates. However, data science education is not currently a graduation requirement at most colleges and universities. As a result, many graduates lack even basic knowledge of data science. To address the shortfall, academic institutions should incorporate introductory data science into general education courses.
   A general education IT course provides a unique opportunity to integrate data science education. Modules covering databases, spreadsheets, and presentation software, already present in many survey IT courses, teach concepts and skills needed for data science. As a result, a survey IT course can provide comprehensive introductory data science education by adding a data science module focused on modeling and evaluation, two key steps in the data science process. The module should use data science software for application, avoiding the complexities of programming and advanced math, while enabling an emphasis on conceptual understanding. We implemented a course built around these ideas and found that the course helps develop data savvy in students.

AB Interest to become a data scientist or related professions in data science domain is rapidly growing. To meet such a demand, we propose a novel educational service that aims to provide tailored learning paths for data science. Our target user is one who aims to be an expert in data science. Our approach is to analyze the background of the practitioner and match the learning units. A critical feature is that we use gamification to reinforce the practitioner engagement. We believe that our work provides a practical guideline for those who want to learn data science.

ID CLASSROOM
AB As the field of K-12 data science education continues to take form, humanistic approaches to teaching and learning about data are needed. Data feminism is an approach that draws on feminist scholarship and action to humanize data and contend with the relationships between data and power. In this review paper, we draw on principles from data feminism to review 42 different educational research and design approaches that engage youth with data, many of which are educational technology intensive and bear on future data-intensive educational technology research and design projects. We describe how the projects engage students with examining power, challenging power, elevating emotion and lived experience, rethinking binaries and hierarchies, embracing pluralism, considering context, and making labour visible. In doing so, we articulate ways that current data education initiatives involve youth in thinking about issues of justice and inclusion. These projects may offer examples of varying complexity for future work to contend with and, ideally, extend in order to further realize data feminism in K-12 data science education. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Data feminism is an emergent framework for changing data practices and discourse in service of equity and justice. Data science education is rapidly growing as a topic of interest in the educational technology research and design communities. Many educational technology and design projects have been launched and shared in publications that preceded the widespread distribution of the data feminism framework. What this paper adds Data feminism is partially re-articulated in terms familiar to educational technology research communities. Prior and recent projects are organized with respect to how they illustrate potential connections to core data feminism principles. This paper identifies specific strategies that recent projects have used that have potential for realizing data feminism principles. Implications for practice and/or policy Educational technologists can use the re-articulated principles of data feminism for education to inform their future design work. Tractable steps to achieve data justice that are attainable within existing educational systems can be pursued. Communities can and should bring together multiple ways of knowing to support new educational practices and futures with data.

AB Data science education can help broaden participation in computer science (CS) because it provides rich, authentic contexts for students to apply their computing knowledge. Data literacy, particularly among underrepresented students, is critical to everyone in this increasingly digital world. However, the integration of data science into K-12 schools is nascent, and the pedagogical training of CS teachers in data science remains limited. Our research-practice partnership modified an existing data science unit to include two pedagogical techniques known to support minoritized students: rich classroom discourse and personally-relevant problem-solving. This paper describes the iterative design process we used to revise and pilot this new data science unit.

AB Random forest (RF) is one of the most popular statistical learning methods in both data science education and applications. Feature selection, enabled by RF, is often among the very first tasks in a data science project, such as the college capstone project, industry consulting projects. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of 12 RF-based feature selection methods for classification problems. The review provides necessary description of each method and the software packages. We show that different methods typically do not provide consistent feature selection results, and the model performance also varies when different RF-based feature selection approaches are employed. This observation suggests that caution must be taken when performing feature selection tasks using RF. Feature selection cannot be blindly done without a sound understanding of the methods adopted, which is not always the case in industry and many senior capstone projects that we have observed. The paper serves as a one-stop reference where students, data science consultants, engineers, and data scientists can access the basic ideas behind these methods, the advantages and limitations of different approaches, as well as the software packages to implement these methods.

TI Reclaiming the right to look: making the case for critical visual
   literacy and data science education
SO CRITICAL STUDIES IN EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Visual cultures; data literacy; visual literacy; data science education;
   aesthetics; right to look
AB As visual cultures scholars have argued, visual expression and aesthetic artifacts largely comprise the modern world. This includes the production of the school as an institution. A critical approach to education therefore must reinscribe students with the ability to see what educational processes attempt to hide and to construct an understanding of the real for themselves. To illustrate this argument, we explore the production of visuality within data science education as one example of how the visual manifests within schools. In response, we propose a visual literacy informed approach to engaging students with data, one that expands beyond contemporary forms of critical data literacy by involving an ontological critique of educational aestheticization. To ground this work, we examine the role of visuality and aesthetics within the implementation of co-designed arts-infused data science projects in four US middle schools. In analyzing interviews with teachers and students, we uncover a series of tensions that reveal the ongoing influence of school visualities alongside the potential for student generated images to amplify their right to look. We therefore argue that critical pedagogies must not only involve reading and critiquing aesthetic artifacts but also engage students in a critique of visuality itself.

AB Arguing and working with data has become commonplace in several study domains. One way to immerse students in hands-on exploration with data is to provide them with problem-solving environments, for example jupyter notebooks, which can scaffold students' reasoning and bring them closer to disciplinary ways of thinking. Although the intrinsic affordances of jupyter notebooks (e.g., interaction with multiple data representations, automation of procedural task aspects) allowstudents to engage in rich learning experiences, students lack crucial social scaffolding that directly targets the process of learning. We are developing an AIED infrastructure EASEx for use in higher education contexts that brings in the affordances of embodied pedagogical agents to significantly advance educational practice by scaffolding students in a personalized manner as they work through problems using jupyter notebooks.

AB Most courses on Data Science offered at universities or online require students to have familiarity with at least one programming language. In this paper, we present, "Milo", a web-based visual programming environment for Data Science Education, designed as a pedagogical tool that can be used by students without prior-programming experience. To that end, Milo uses graphical blocks as abstractions of language specific implementations of Data Science and Machine Learning(ML) concepts along with creation of interactive visualizations. Using block definitions created by a user, Milo generates equivalent source code in JavaScript to run entirely in the browser. Based on a preliminary user study with a focus group of undergraduate computer science students, Milo succeeds as an effective tool for novice learners in the field of Data Science.

AB PurposeWith increased focus on data literacy and data science education in K-12, little is known about what makes a data set preferable for use by classroom teachers. Given that educational designers often privilege authenticity, the purpose of this study is to examine how teachers use features of data sets to determine their suitability for authentic data science learning experiences with their students.Design/methodology/approachInterviews with 12 practicing high school mathematics and statistics teachers were conducted and video-recorded. Teachers were given two different data sets about the same context and asked to explain which one would be better suited for an authentic data science experience. Following knowledge analysis methods, the teachers' responses were coded and iteratively reviewed to find themes that appeared across multiple teachers related to their aesthetic judgments.FindingsThree aspects of authenticity for data sets for this task were identified. These include thinking of authentic data sets as being "messy," as requiring more work for the student or analyst to pore through than other data sets and as involving computation.Originality/valueAnalysis of teachers' aesthetics of data sets is a new direction for work on data literacy and data science education. The findings invite the field to think critically about how to help teachers develop new aesthetics and to provide data sets in curriculum materials that are suited for classroom use.

AB The increasing datafication of African societies has led to a proliferation of data science-related training opportunities. These trainings provide young people with the opportunity to learn the skills to work on Data science, with some focused specifically on women and girls. While this is encouraging and brings new opportunities for women and girls to participate in the knowledge economy, it is important to understand the wider context of data science training in Africa, in particular, how women and girls experience their (data science) education, and how this knowledge can impact their lives, sustain livelihoods and bring empowerment. Through a review of the literature, as well as an examination of different pedagogical approaches and practices used by various formal and informal training programs in Africa, we examined the experience of women and girls. We conducted a mapping of the training and networks that have been set up to provide knowledge and skills and to empower women in data science. We highlight some of the facilitators that have positively contributed to a greater participation of women and girls in data science education, while also revealing some of the barriers and structural impediments to fair access to training for women in data science.

AB This panel brings the workings and results of the ACM Education Council Task Force on Data Science Education. The task force has gathered information on existing programs and has reviewed documents such as the result of the National Academies deliberations on data science. The task force is charged with exploring the role of computer science in data science education, understanding that data science is an inherently interdisciplinary field and not exclusively a computer science field. The panel will present a summary of the task force findings by two members of the task force and perspectives from leaders in data-intensive applications from China. The goal of the panel is to present the findings, but also to obtain perspectives from the attendees in order to enrich the task force's work.

AB The COVID-19 global pandemic has required everyone to make sense of data about community spread, levels of risk, and vaccine efficacy. Yet research shows that students are underprepared in data literacy. Tanya LaMar and Jo Boaler argue that data science education provides an opportunity to address this problem while providing much needed updates to the current mathematics curriculum. The integration of data science can provide a more equitable mathematics pipeline than the calculus-focused pathway that has excluded most students from a future in mathematics. Through data science, students can learn to answer questions that are relevant to their lives and communities, to be critical consumers of the data that surround them every day, and to wield the power of data analysis.

AB In this paper, we will describe an introduction to Data Science for secondary school students. We will report on the design and implementation of an introductory unit on "Data and data detectives with CODAP" in which secondary school students used the online tool CODAP to explore real and meaningful survey data on leisure time activities and media use (so-called JIM-PB data) in a statistical project setting as a starting point for data science. The JIM-PB data set served as a valuable data set that offered meaningful and exciting opportunities for data exploration for secondary school students, and CODAP proved to be a valuable tool for the first explorations of this data.

AB The paper addresses the questions of data science education of current importance. It aims to introduce and justify the framework that allows flexibly evaluate the processes of a data expedition and a digital media created during it. For these purposes, the authors explore features of digital media artefacts which are specific to data expeditions and are essential to accurate evaluation. The rubrics as a power but hardly formalizable evaluation method in application to digital media artefacts are also discussed. Moreover, the paper documents the experience of rubrics creation according to the suggested framework. The rubrics were successfully adopted to two data-driven journalism courses. The authors also formulate recommendations on data expedition evaluation which should take into consideration structural features of a data expedition, distinctive features of digital media, etc.

AB Variability is underemphasized in domains such as engineering. Statistics and data science education research offers a variety of frameworks for understanding variability, but new frameworks for domain applications are necessary. This study investigated the professional practices of working engineers to develop such a framework. The Neglected, Acknowledged, or Targeted (NAT) Taxonomy describes whether one's data analysis choices engage with variability, and whether those choices target the potential consequences of variability, within a given domain. A targeted analysis is the most beneficial rung for engineering applications and is therefore a useful concept for instruction. This study describes the qualitative methods used to develop the NAT Taxonomy and describes how the taxonomy can be used in statistics and data science education, particularly in support of other domain applications.

AB More research is needed involving middle school students' engagement in the statistical problem-solving process, particularly the beginning process steps: formulate a question and make a plan to collect data/consider the data. Further, the increased availability of large-scale electronically accessible data sets is an untapped area of study. This interpretive study examined middle school students' understanding of statistical concepts involved in making a plan to collect data to answer a statistical question within a social issue context using data available on the internet. Student artifacts, researcher notes, and audio and video recordings from nine groups of 20 seventh-grade students in two gifted education pull-out classes at a suburban middle school were used to answer the study research questions. Data were analyzed using a priori codes from previously developed frameworks and by using an inductive approach to find themes.
   Three themes that emerged from data related to confirmation bias. Some middle school students held preconceptions about the social issues they chose to study that biased their statistical questions. This in turn influenced the sources of data students used to answer their questions. Confirmation bias is a serious issue that is exacerbated due to endless sources of data electronically available. We argue that this type of bias should be addressed early in students' educational experiences. Based on the findings from this study, we offer recommendations for future research and implications for statistics and data science education.

AB The paper addresses the questions of data science education of current importance. It aims to introduce and justify the framework that allows flexibly evaluate the processes of a data expedition and a digital media created during it. For these purposes, the authors explore features of digital media artefacts which are specific to data expeditions and are essential to accurate evaluation. The rubrics as a power but hardly formalizable evaluation method in application to digital media artefacts are also discussed. Moreover, the paper documents the experience of rubrics creation according to the suggested framework. The rubrics were successfully adopted to two data-driven journalism courses. The authors also formulate recommendations on data expedition evaluation which should take into consideration structural features of a data expedition, distinctive features of digital media, etc.

AB In this paper, we utilize duoethnography - a research method in which prac-titioners discursively interrogate the relationships between culture, context, and the mechanisms which shape individual autobiographical experiences - to ex-plore what may be beyond ethics in the context of data science. Although ethical frameworks have the ability to reflect cultural priorities, a singular view of ethics, as we explore, often fails to speak to the multiple and diverse priorities held both within and across institutional spaces. To that end, this paper explores multiple perspectives, epistemologies, and worldviews that can collectively push researchers towards considerations of a data science education that is equity -minded both in concept and practice. Through a set of dialogues which examine our positionalities, journeys, ethics, local cultures, and accountabilities, this pa-per explores the contextual realities rooted in the authors' educational settings. These conversations focus on the humanity of our students, the communities from which we come from and serve, as well as the unintentional harms and possibilities associated with the development of data science programs across institutional types. We take a set of five core questions to examine how we made, and continue to make, sense of our diverse cultural perspectives on data science education and equity with/in relation to others' realities. Broadly, this paper seeks to offer reflections on the related but differing functions of ethics and equity in data science education.

AB In April 2017, Shiga University launched an undergraduate program in the new faculty of data science. This faculty emphasizes the study and application of statistics and is the first of its kind in Japan. Shiga University also plans to launch a master's program in data science starting in April 2019. The inauguration of the faculty marks a new era of statistics and data science education in Japanese universities, in view of the fact that there were virtually no statistics faculties in Japanese universities before that of Shiga University. In April 2018, Yokohama City University will follow Shiga University with the opening of a new school of data science. We discuss the background of these developments and the prospects of statistics and data science in Japan.

AB In response to the current trends in dealing with data in academia, various research institutions and commercial entities around the world are building new programmes to fill the gaps in workforce demand in specific disciplines, including data curation, big data, data management, data science and data analytics. Thus, the aim of the present study was to reveal the reality of data science education in the Middle East and to determine the opportunities and challenges for teaching data science in the region. Thirteen countries in the Middle East were offering 48 data science programmes at the time of the study. The results reveal that these data science programmes significantly use the words 'data' and 'analytics' in their names. With regard to the academic affiliations of the data science programmes, the study found that they are offered in a variety of schools, especially computer science, information technology and business. Moreover, the study found that computer science is the dominant trend in the programmes. Data science programmes have a significant overlap with other programmes, especially statistics and computer science, because of the interdisciplinary nature of this field. Data science schools in the Middle East differ in terms of their programme titles, programme descriptions, course catalogues, curriculum structures and course objectives. Broadly, this study may be useful for those who are seeking to establish a data science programme or to strengthen data science curricula at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

AB Objective: To discuss and illustrate the utility of two open collaborative data science platforms, and how they would benefit data science and informatics education.
   Methods and Materials: The features of two online data science platforms are outlined. Both are useful for new data projects and both are integrated with common programming languages used for data analysis. One platform focuses more on data exploration and the other focuses on containerizing, visualization, and sharing code repositories.
   Results: Both data science platforms are open, free, and allow for collaboration. Both are capable of visual, descriptive, and predictive analytics
   Discussion: Data science education benefits by having affordable open and collaborative platforms to conduct a variety of data analyses.
   Conclusion: Open collaborative data science platforms are particularly useful for teaching data science skills to clinical and nonclinical informatics students. Commercial data science platforms exist but are cost-prohibitive and generally limited to specific programming languages.

AB In the Indian Universities, data science courses are offered to computer science undergraduates only in their higher semesters of under-graduation. Keeping in mind, the growing importance of data science, under-graduates need to be introduced to data science courses in their first year of under-graduation itself. Although first year undergraduates are furnished with the required mathematical and statistical concepts during their higher secondary education, a requirement of understanding sophisticated programming concepts hamstrings universities from offering courses in data science to first year undergraduates. As an outcome of our research, we propose a software named MetaData. MetaData abstracts all levels of implementation and helps students better understand the fundamental concepts in data science by observing the applicability of these concepts on real-world datasets. We justify the effectiveness of the tool through a data science classroom scenario, wherein 44 first year undergraduates were encouraged to use the tool and provide constructive feedback.

AB Data science has been growing in prominence across both academia and industry, but there is still little formal consensus about how to teach it. Many people who currently teach data science are practitioners such as computational researchers in academia or data scientists in industry. To understand how these practitioner-instructors pass their knowledge onto novices and how that contrasts with teaching more traditional forms of programming, we interviewed 20 data scientists who teach in settings ranging from small-group workshops to large online courses. We found that: 1) they must empathize with a diverse array of student backgrounds and expectations, 2) they teach technical workflows that integrate authentic practices surrounding code, data, and communication, 3) they face challenges involving authenticity versus abstraction in software setup, finding and curating pedagogically-relevant datasets, and acclimating students to live with uncertainty in data analysis. These findings can point the way toward better tools for data science education and help bring data literacy to more people around the world.

AB Hackathons have been used not only by enterprises for technological innovation and digital transformation, but also in academia for education innovation and programme promotion. This paper presents a hybrid approach for transforming an enterprise's workplace problem into a technology vendor- sponsored hackathon education. A real-life case study of a hackathon for college participants who are prospective students of a university data science programme is demonstrated. The university-industry collaborative approach of the hackathon provides several benefits for its stakeholders, namely promoting the reputation and recognition of the university's data science programme; offering creative and innovative solutions to the enterprise's workplace problems; encouraging the adoption of the technology vendor's platform, and finally, enhancing the teaching and learning experience for the college students and lecturers. This paper provides a structured framework and recommends practical principles and guidelines for designing effective hackathons that can bring about mind-set change and real-world business transformation.

AB This article about Active learning in data science education deals with methods and tools to support active learning of data science, in particular within the Knowledge Discovery subject at the Technical University of Kosice, Slovakia. One of the results of the work presented in this article is an implemented web application to support active learning in data science. The article involves a brief overview of the methods supporting the active learning which may be used also for teaching data science. The final web application which was proposed and tested by the users, was created by RShiny application. The supporting application is helpful mainly for the students as an interactive mean of active learning in data science. The result of the article is available and it was applied in practice. This work contributes to the effective learning of the users (learners) as well as it contributes to better understanding, comprehension and application of the acquired knowledge and experiences of the students in practice by means of active learning.

AB In this paper, we introduce Notice, Wonder, Feel, Act, and Reimagine (NWFAR) to promote social justice in data science (DS) education. NWFAR draws on intersectional feminist DS to scaffold critical perspectives towards systems of power and oppression and attend to students' experiences in designs for learning. NWFAR adds three practices that are typically not emphasized in learning designs for DS: feel- engaging emotions and the physical body; act-challenging, inspiring, or informing others towards change; and reimagine-envisioning how data, data methods, and data technologies could pursue different problems, solutions, and perspectives. We illustrate NWFAR through two design-based research projects from prior empirical work. Through these two examples, we demonstrate what thinking with NWFAR could look like in practice and highlight future possibilities for learning. We conclude with a discussion that focuses on the reimagining dimension, in which we highlight social justice oriented theories.

AB In this article we describe our experiences building a large-scale data science program aimed at supporting diversity in online data science learning. This program was built to support a set of introductory skills-based, higher education courses. We are motivated by work done in project-based learning contexts and culturally responsive pedagogies and are particularly keen to understand how we can scale such kinds of approaches to large and diverse global classrooms. Specifically, we consider the country from which a learner is accessing the course as the key context for our work and discuss two interrelated investigations we have undertaken to understand how this feature interacts with learners' motivation and learning. Our findings provide insights on how learners respond to location-specific problem-based personalizations in data science education and provides an initial exploration as to how this form of personalization differs depending on the geo-political context of the learners.

AB This study proposes and evaluates the OCEL.AI (Open Collaborative Experiential Learning. AI) paradigm that aims at broadening participation in data science education and enhancing un-dergraduate students' data literacy. The core of the paradigm is the "Tell Stories" approach. This approach applies the 5W+1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How) conceptual schema of stories as a transdisciplinary language for data science education for STEM and non-STEM majors. Accordingly, this study reported findings from the OCEL.AI project that implemented and eval-uated the paradigm. A field experiment, in addition to classroom observations, was conducted to compare the learning outcomes of students in data science competence, appreciation, career motivation, life-long willingness to learn, and self-efficacy in data science between the treatment group and the control group. The results showed that the OCEL.AI paradigm improved un-dergraduates' data science competence and career motivation despite majors or gender.

ID TOOLS
AB With increasing demand for training in data science, extracurricular or "ad hoc" education efforts have emerged to help individuals acquire relevant skills and expertise. Although extracurricular efforts already exist for many computationally intensive disciplines, their support of data science education has significantly helped in coping with the speed of innovation in data science practice and formal curricula. While the proliferation of ad hoc efforts is an indication of their popularity, less has been documented about the needs that they are designed to meet, the limitations that they face, and practical suggestions for holding successful efforts. To holistically understand the role of different ad hoc formats for data science, we surveyed organizers of ad hoc data science education efforts to understand how organizers perceived the events to have gone-including areas of strength and areas requiring growth. We also gathered recommendations from these past events for future organizers. Our results suggest that the perceived benefits of ad hoc efforts go beyond developing technical skills and may provide continued benefit in conjunction with formal curricula, which warrants further investigation. As increasing numbers of researchers from computational fields with a history of complex data become involved with ad hoc efforts to share their skills, the lessons learned that we extract from the surveys will provide concrete suggestions for the practitioner-leaders interested in creating, improving, and sustaining future efforts.
   Author summary
   Large datasets are becoming integral to society broadly and to biological sciences in particular. As a result, demand for sophisticated data skills and experience has skyrocketed and left some individuals scrambling to cross-train and acquire more computational skills. While universities are racing to develop formal curricula to meet this demand, diverse informal efforts have emerged to fill the immediate demand for skills and experience. These "ad hoc" efforts have been playing a vital role in data science education, especially for domain scientists. While some studies have shown specific ad hoc formats to have considerable impact, few studies have focused on these efforts holistically. Here, we survey effort organizers from leading data science institutes and collect lessons learned. We find that efforts are commonly reported to successfully provide opportunities in difficult areas where curricula could improve, such as providing approachable introductions to new skills, increasing diversity of backgrounds, and fostering heterogeneous communities. However, efforts also report challenges fulfilling diverse needs and offer suggestions. In total, the lessons that we collect from these efforts are useful to improve future ad hoc efforts and to inform formal programs, which may be looking for inspiration to design innovative educational formats.

AB Data science education has gained momentum in recent years. Along with the development of curricula to teach data science, the number and diversity of tools for introducing data science to learners are also multiplying. The tools used to teach data science play a central role in shaping the learning experience. Therefore, it is important to carefully choose which tools to use to introduce learners to data science. This article presents a systematic analysis of 30 data science tools that are, or designed to be, used in introductory data science education for K-12 students. The identified tools list includes spreadsheets, visual analysis tools, and scripting environments. For each tool, we examine facets of its capabilities, interactions, educational support, and accessibility. For block-based programming tools, we also examine the data science functionalities available in that tool's blocks. This paper advances our understanding of the current state of introductory data science environments and highlights opportunities for creating new tools to better prepare learners to navigate the data-rich world surrounding them.

AB Education on machine learning and data science has drawn a lot of attention in both higher education and vocational training. Although various tools and services such as Jupyter Notebook and Google Cloud's AI have been developed for building and training models, they are not suitable for direct use in educational settings. For example, teachers expect a platform where they can easily distribute and grade programming assignments, and students want to quickly start coding and training models without the burden of setting up an environment. To this end, we develop MLadder, an online training system for machine learning and data science education. Specifically, we seamlessly integrate two open-source software, CodaLab and Jupyter Notebook, which are used for hosting assignments and building models, respectively. Moreover, we devise several methods to make the system lightweight and scalable, so that it can be deployed on-premises even with limited resources. We have used MLadder in the machine learning and data science courses in our school and facilitated both teaching and learning.

AB ChatGPT is one of many generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools that has emerged recently, creating controversy in the education community with concerns about its potential to be used for plagiarism and to undermine students' ability to think independently. Recent publications have criticized the use of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools in the classroom, with little focus on the potential benefits. This article focuses on the potential of ChatGPT as an educational tool for statistics and data science. It encourages readers to consider the history of trepidation surrounding introducing new technology in the classroom, such as the calculator. We explore the possibility of leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities in statistics and data science education, providing examples of how ChatGPT can aid in developing course materials and suggestions for how educators can prompt students to interact with ChatGPT responsibly. As educators, we can guide the use of generative AI tools in statistics and data science classrooms so that students and educators can leverage the benefits of this technology.

AB Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research. Data science is not an exception. In recent years scientists were concerned about a large number of irreproducible studies. Such reproducibility crisis in science could severely undermine public trust in science and science-based public policy. Recent efforts to promote reproducible research mainly focused on matured scientists and much less on student training. In this study, we conducted action research on students in data science to evaluate to what extent students are ready for communicating reproducible data analysis. The results show that although two-thirds of the students claimed they were able to reproduce results in peer reports, only one-third of reports provided all necessary information for replication. The actual replication results also include conflicting claims; some lacked comparisons of original and replication results, indicating that some students did not share a consistent understanding of what reproducibility means and how to report replication results. The findings suggest that more training is needed to help data science students communicating reproducible data analysis.

AB Data has become central to the technologies and services that human-computer interaction (HCI) designers make, and the ethical use of data in and through these technologies should be given critical attention throughout the design process. However, there is little research on ethics education in computer science that explicitly addresses data ethics. We present and analyze Re-Shape, a method to teach students about the ethical implications of data collection and use. Re-Shape, as part of an educational environment, builds upon the idea of cultivating care and allows students to collect, process, and visualize their physical movement data in ways that support critical reflection and coordinated classroom activities about data, data privacy, and human-centered systems for data science. We also use a case study of Re-Shape in an undergraduate computer science course to explore prospects and limitations of instructional designs and educational technology such as Re-Shape that leverage personal data to teach data ethics.

AB ChatGPT is a conversational AI platform that can produce code to solve problems when provided with a natural language prompt. Prior work on similar AI models has shown that they perform well on typical intro-level Computer Science problems. However, little is known about the performance of such tools on Data Science (DS) problems. In this work, we assess the performance of ChatGPT on assignments from three DS courses with varying difficulty levels. First, we apply the raw assignment prompts provided to the students and find that ChatGPT performs well on assignments with dataset(s) descriptions and progressive question prompts, which divide the programming requirements into sub-problems. Then, we perform prompt engineering on the assignments for which ChatGPT had low performance. We find that the following prompt engineering techniques significantly increased ChatGPT's performance: breaking down abstract questions into steps, breaking down steps into multiple prompts, providing descriptions of the dataset(s), including algorithmic details, adding specific instructions to entice specific actions, and removing extraneous information. Finally, we discuss how our findings suggest potential changes to curriculum design of DS courses.

AB During the last several years, we have observed an exponential increase in the demand for Data Scientists in the job market. As a result, a number of trainings, courses, books, and university educational programs (both at undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate levels) have been labeled as "Big data" or "Data Science"; the fil-rouge of each of them is the aim at forming people with the right competencies and skills to satisfy the business sector needs. In this paper, we report on some of the exercises done in analyzing current Data Science education offer and matching with the needs of the job markets to propose a scalable matching service, ie, COmpetencies ClassificatiOn (E-CO-2), based on Data Science techniques. The E-CO-2 service can help to extract relevant information from Data Science-related documents (course descriptions, job Ads, blogs, or papers), which enable the comparison of the demand and offer in the field of Data Science Education and HR management, ultimately helping to establish the profession of Data Scientist.

AB While data science education has gained increased recognition in both academic institutions and industry, there has been a lack of research on automated coding assessment for novice students. Our work presents a first step in this direction, by leveraging the coding metrics from traditional software engineering (Halstead Volume and Cyclomatic Complexity) in combination with those that reflect a data science project's learning objectives (number of library calls and number of common library calls with the solution code). Through these metrics, we examined the code submissions of 97 students across two semesters of an introductory data science course. Our results indicated that the metrics can identify cases where students had overly complicated codes and would benefit from scaffolding feedback. The number of library calls, in particular, was also a significant predictor of changes in submission score and submission runtime, which highlights the distinctive nature of data science programming. We conclude with suggestions for extending our analyses towards more actionable intervention strategies, for example by tracking the fine-grained submission grading outputs throughout a student's submission history, to better model and support them in their data science learning process.

AB Like medicine, psychology, or education, data science is fundamentally an applied discipline, with most students who receive advanced degrees in the field going on to work on practical problems. Unlike these disciplines, however, data science education remains heavily focused on theory and methods, and practical coursework typically revolves around cleaned or simplified data sets that have little analog in professional applications. We believe that the environment in which new data scientists are trained should more accurately reflect that in which they will eventually practice, and we propose here a data science master's degree program that takes inspiration from the residency model used in medicine. Students in the suggested program would spend their time working on a practical problem with an industry, government, or nonprofit partner, supplemented with coursework in data science methods and theory. We also discuss how this program can also be implemented in shorter formats to augment existing professional master's programs in different disciplines. This approach to learning by doing is designed to fill gaps in our current approach to data science education and ensure that students develop the skills they need to practice data science in a professional context and under the many constraints imposed by that context.

AB Data visualization technologies are powerful tools for telling evidence-based narratives about oneself and the world. This paper contributes to the literature on data science education by examining the sociotechnical practices of data wrangling-strategies for selecting and managing large, aggregated datasets to produce a model and story. We examined the learning opportunities related to data wrangling practices by investigating youth's talk-in-interaction while assembling models and stories about family migration using interactive data visualization tools and large socioeconomic datasets. We first identified ten sociotechnical practices that characterize youth's interaction with tools and collaboration in data wrangling. We then suggest four categories of activities to describe patterns of learning related to the practices, including addressing missing data, understanding data aggregation, exploring social or historical events that constitute the formation of data patterns, and varying data visual encoding for storytelling. These practices and activities are important to understand for supporting future data science education opportunities that facilitate learning and discussion about scientific and socioeconomic issues. This study also sheds light on how the family migration modeling context positions the youth as having agency and authority over the data and contributes to the design of CSCL environments that tackle the challenges of data wrangling.

AB Data Science is a recent area that integrates data engineering and computing intelligence to support decision making. It is also a recent professional field which requires experts with knowledge in Statistics, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and specific Business Models. Organizations that pursue data intelligence consider Data Science professionals immensely relevant. However, universities and higher education institutions are starting to offer undergraduate programs and courses for Data Science education. In this sense, EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) is presented as a relevant framework to further the education of Data Science Professionals. Thus, this article addresses the integration of EDSF with ADDIE Model, an instructional design model, capable of enabling the construction of an Instructional System (IS). Based on the Learning Outcomes (LO) of the EDSF Model Curriculum Data Science (MC-DS), the article proposes an integrated approach of these LOs along with the phases of ADDIE Model supporting the construction of a Data Science Instructional System (DSIS). This integrated approach assists the understanding of the development of a DSIS and its learning objects, with its technological needs, such as: hardware environment, programming environments (IDEs, scripts, etc.), database models (SQL and NoSQL), massive data storage and processing tools, visualization tools, among others.

AB Students often have a lack of understanding and awareness of where, how, and why personal data about them is collected and processed. Especially, when interacting with data-driven digital artifacts, an appropriate perception of the data collection and processing is necessary for self-determination. This dissertation deals with the development and evaluation of a concept called data awareness which aims to foster students' self-determination interacting with data-driven digital artifacts.

AB Large-scale medical data sets are vital for hands-on education in health data science but are often inaccessible due to privacy concerns. Addressing this gap, we developed the Health Gym project, a free and open-source platform designed to generate synthetic health data sets applicable to various areas of data science education, including machine learning, data visualization, and traditional statistical models. Initially, we generated 3 synthetic data sets for sepsis, acute hypotension, and antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection. This paper discusses the educational applications of Health Gym's synthetic data sets. We illustrate this through their use in postgraduate health data science courses delivered by the University of New South Wales, Australia, and a Datathon event, involving academics, students, clinicians, and local health district professionals. We also include adaptable worked examples using our synthetic data sets, designed to enrich hands-on tutorial and workshop experiences. Although we highlight the potential of these data sets in advancing data science education and health care artificial intelligence, we also emphasize the need for continued research into the inherent limitations of synthetic data.

AB Importance of Data Science education and training is growing with the emergence of data driven technologies and organisational culture that intend to derive actionable value for improving research process or enterprise business using variety of enterprise data and widely available open and social media data. Modern data driven research and industry require new types of specialists that are capable to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. The education and training of Data Scientists requires multi-disciplinary approach combining wide view of the Data Science and Analytics foundation with deep practical knowledge in domain specific areas. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple form, also providing sufficient data labs facilities for practical training. This paper discusses approach to building customizable Data Science curriculum for different types of learners based on using the ontology of the EDISON Data Science Framework ( EDSF) developed in the EU funded Project EDISON and widely used by universities and professional training organisations.

AB The interdisciplinary field of data science, which applies techniques from computer science and statistics to address questions across domains, has enjoyed recent considerable growth and interest. This emergence also extends to undergraduate education, whereby a growing number of institutions now offer degree programs in data science. However, there is considerable variation in what the field actually entails and, by extension, differences in how undergraduate programs prepare students for data-intensive careers. We used two seminal frameworks for data science education to evaluate undergraduate data science programs at a subset of 4-year institutions in the United States; developing and applying a rubric, we assessed how well each program met the guidelines of each of the frameworks. Most programs scored high in statistics and computer science and low in domain-specific education, ethics, and areas of communication. Moreover, the academic unit administering the degree program significantly influenced the course-load distribution of computer science and statistics/mathematics courses. We conclude that current data science undergraduate programs provide solid grounding in computational and statistical approaches, yet may not deliver sufficient context in terms of domain knowledge and ethical considerations necessary for appropriate data science applications. Additional refinement of the expectations for undergraduate data science education is warranted.

AB The Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education (JSDSE) has a history of initiatives to expand its readership and impact. In this article, we reflect on JSDSE's relevance to K-12 education and how it might increase its influence in this area. We characterize JSDSE's K-12 impact partially in terms of its ability to foster statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT). We also introduce a new construct, statistical knowledge for the transformation of teaching (SKT2), to more fully capture the K-12 contributions JSDSE can make. Our analysis draws upon the perspectives of an experienced high school teacher (the first author) and a statistics education researcher (the second author). The first author of the article surveyed recent JSDSE issues to identify and reflect upon articles with implications for his teaching practice. The second author framed the first author's article reflections in terms of their connections to SKT and SKT2. Drawing upon our collaborative analysis, we propose strategies to help JSDSE more fully realize its potential to contribute to SKT and SKT2. We explain how acting on the proposed strategies may help JSDSE readers, authors, and editors bridge the persistent historical gap between formal scholarship and practice in K-12 education.

AB It is recommended that teacher-scholars of data science adopt reproducible workflows in their research as scholars and teach reproducible workflows to their students. In this article, we propose a third dimension to reproducibility practices and recommend that regardless of whether they teach reproducibility in their courses or not, data science instructors adopt reproducible workflows for their own teaching. We consider computational reproducibility, documentation, and openness as three pillars of reproducible teaching framework. We share tools, examples, and recommendations for the three pillars.

AB In the last decade, the signal processing (SP) community has witnessed a paradigm shift from model-based to data-driven methods. Machine learning (ML)-more specifically, deep learning-methodologies are nowadays widely used in all SP fields, e.g., audio, speech, image, video, multimedia, and multimodal/multisensor processing, to name a few. Many data-driven methods also incorporate domain knowledge to improve problem modeling, especially when computational burden, training data scarceness, and memory size are important constraints.

AB The popularity of data science, influenced by the trends from the United States around 2010, has significantly impacted the education of various statistics departments at domestic universities. However, it is challenging to find research papers in domestic academic journals that address the efficient teaching of data science topics in relation to computing environment. This article will discuss and propose the establishment of a suitable computing infrastructure for the education and research in statistics and data science departments in domestic universities.

AB It often takes years of hands-on practice to build operational problem solving skills for a data scientist to be sufficiently competent to tackle real world problems. In this research, we explore a new scalable technology-enhanced learning (TEL) platform that enables accelerated apprenticeship process via a repository of caselets - small but focused case studies with scaffolding questions and feedback. In this paper, we report rationales of the design, caselet authoring process, and the planned experiment with cohorts of students who will use caselets while taking graduate level data science courses.

AB In the next wave of educating future data scientists, we need to think of all undergraduate students, regardless of background or major, as future data scientists. We should train them in supportive, interdisciplinary environments. Starting from their first day at college, they should be given the opportunity to apply powerful tools to large data sets, using real-world problems. Partnerships with research computing, academic departments, research centers, companies, government, and nonprofits will all be necessary to fully prepare these students for the breadth of the data science workforce.

DT Article
AB The Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education special issue on "Computing in the Statistics and Data Science Curriculum" features a set of papers that provide a mosaic of curricular innovations and approaches that embrace computing. As we reviewed the papers we felt that this collection would benefit from the perspective of the authors of the landmark "Computing in the Statistics Curricula" (TAS 2010) paper. We asked Deb and Duncan to take this opportunity to reflect on the landscape when they wrote the paper, to comment on the current situation, and to speculate on the future.

AB Gender imbalance in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) studies and occupations is a well-known phenomenon with a large body of research that tries to explain it and offer remedial interventions.
   Data science is a new and interdisciplinary STEM-oriented domain, integrating knowledge and skills from computer science, mathematics, and statistics with an application domain, from which the data draw their context and meaning. Data science applications are relevant for various domains, and therefore, a variety of populations are increasingly attracted to learning it.
   Addressing the theme of the conference, i.e., "Women in Engineering", in this paper we describe a data science workshop for social sciences and digital humanities researchers. A significant majority (83%) of the participants of this workshop self-identified as women. This gender proportion, the opposite of that prevailing in STEM studies, led us to examine the workshop from a gender perspective.
   Our results indicate that the women participating in the data science workshop perceived it as an opportunity to acquire research tools rather than programming tools. We suggest that framing the workshop as a research tool workshop and not as a programming workshop reduced prevalent gender barriers in STEM, encouraging a majority of women researchers to participate. In this paper, we elaborate on the participants' perceptions about data science and programming and analyze them based on three theoretical perspectives: expectancy value theory, the interdisciplinary perspective, and the epistemological perspective. Keywords-data science, data science education, gender balance, interdisciplinary of data science.

AB The growth of the data culture has led to calls for improving data literacy among primary and secondary students and their teachers. One approach to improving data literacy is to teach a course devoted to data science but, given the lack of consensus over the term "data science," just what should an introductory data science course include? The author argues that at the secondary level, an introductory data science course should strive to teach data-scientific thinking, which has statistical thinking at its core, blended with some computational thinking, and with a dash of mathematics.

AB The rise of the "big data" era has created a pressing demand for educating many data scientists and engineers quickly at low cost. It is essential they learn by working on assignments that involve real world data sets to develop the skills needed to be successful in the workplace. However, enabling instructors to flexibly deliver all kinds of data science assignments using real world data sets to large numbers of learners (both on-campus and off-campus) at low cost is a significant open challenge. To address this emerging challenge generally, we develop and deploy a novel Cloud-based Lab for Data Science (CLaDS) to enable many learners around the world to work on real-world data science problems without having to move or otherwise distribute prohibitively large data sets. Leveraging version control and continuous integration, CLaDS provides a general infrastructure to enable any instructor to conveniently deliver any hands-on data science assignment that uses large real world data sets to as many learners as our cloud-computing infrastructure allows at very low cost. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CLaDS and discuss our experience with using CLaDS to deploy seven major text data assignments for students in both an on-campus course and an online course to work on for learning about text data retrieval and mining techniques; this shows that CLaDS is a very promising novel general infrastructure for efficiently delivering a wide range of hands-on data science assignments to a large number of learners at very low cost.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a study exploring the emerging field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective. Design/methodology/approach Content analysis of research publications on data science was made of papers published in the Web of Science database to identify the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective. Findings A content analysis of 80 publications is presented. The articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. The category of tools, techniques and applications of data science was most addressed by the authors, followed by data science from the perspective of health sciences, data science education and training and knowledge and skills of the data professional. However, several publications fell into several categories because these topics were closely related. Research limitations/implications Only publication recorded in the Web of Science database and with the term "data science" in the topic area were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that either were related to other keywords such as "e-science", "e-research", "data service", "data curation", "research data management" or "scientific data management" or were not present in the Web of Science database. Originality/value The paper provides the first exploration by content analysis of the field of data science from the perspective of the LIS.

AB In this paper, we discuss the evolution of assignments in a data warehousing course to address the burgeoning interest and enrollment of students in data science programs. We focus on our experience incorporating the Teradata University Network (TUN) Data Challenge competition project as a class assignment. Students worked in small teams to answer questions posed by a non-profit organization, Hire Heroes USA, using their data about activities to help veterans and their spouses find employment. Students had free access to cutting edge industry visualization and analytics tools via TUN and its partner organizations. Course learning objectives were met successfully and students were enthusiastic about using real-world data to help a humanitarian organization better serve its clientele.

AB A phenomenon of citizen science, its features and prospects are the topic of high actuality nowadays. And it seems to be natural, that citizen science and crowdsourcing techniques penetrate to such popular area as data science. This paper considers the questions about teaching data science and the areas, which borrow the techniques from data science. The review of learning outcomes, which may be gained from projects of citizen science, allows to propose educational data expeditions to be adopted into educational courses. Moreover, the paper represents the principles of citizen science as a mean of making a fully open educational project and to validate it as a learning tool.

AB This paper presents findings from an interview study of research data managers in academic data archives. Our study examined policies and professional autonomy with a focus on dilemmas encountered in everyday work by data managers. We found that dilemmas arose at every stage of the research data lifecycle, and legacy data presents particularly vexing challenges. The iFields' emphasis on knowledge organization and representation provides insight into how data, used by scientists, are used to create knowledge. The iFields' disciplinary emphasis also encompasses the sociotechnical complexity of dilemmas that we found arise in research data management. Therefore, we posit that iSchools are positioned to contribute to data science education by teaching about ethics and infrastructure used to collect, organize, and disseminate data through problem-based learning.

AB Data science is a bridge discipline connecting fundamental science, applied disciplines, and the arts. The demand for novel data science methods is well established. However, there is much less agreement on the core aspects of representation, modeling, and analytics that involve huge and heterogeneous datasets. The scientific community needs to build consensus about data science education and training curricula, including the necessary entry matriculation prerequisites and the expected learning competency outcomes needed to tackle complex Big Data challenges. To meet the rapidly increasing demand for effective evidence-based practice and data analytic methods, research teams, funding agencies, academic institutions, politicians, and industry leaders should embrace innovation, promote high-risk projects, join forces to expand the technological capacity, and enhance the workforce skills.

AB In this experience report, we describe the Investigating Air Quality curriculum unit that integrates computational data practices with science learning in middle school science classrooms. The unit is part of the Coding Science Internship instructional model, designed to broaden access to computer science (CS) learning through scalable integration in core science courses, and through confronting barriers to equitable participation in STEM. In this report, we describe the core features of the unit and share preliminary findings and insights from student experiences in 13 science classrooms. We discuss affordances and challenges for student learning of computational data practices in formal science classrooms, and conclude with emerging recommendations for instructional designers.

AB Data science, and the related field of analytics, is an emerging discipline that integrates concepts across a range of domains, including computer science, information systems, software engineering and statistics. While the number of data science / analytics programs continues to increase, there has been little discussion on how we should define this emerging educational field. This panel will foster a debate with respect to what are the key learning objectives within these programs and should there be different types of data science related programs (such as an applied data science program or a business analytics program in addition to data science programs). Via a debate, this panel, along with the audience, will explore the field of data science and these emerging questions regarding data science and analytics education.

AB The design and analysis of experiments (DOE) has historically been an important part of an education in statistics, and with the increasing complexity of modern production processes and the advent of large-scale online experiments, it continues to be highly relevant. In this article, we provide an extensive review of the literature on DOE pedagogy, and provide five perspectives on the subject: one from each of the authors as well as a composite profile derived from a survey of DOE instructors. Our work provides a snapshot of current DOE pedagogy that showcases both the similarities and variety in how the subject is taught, as well as a look ahead at how its instruction may evolve. for this article are available online.

AB We developed an interactive online textbook that interleaves R programming activities with text as a way to facilitate students' understanding of statistical ideas while minimizing the cognitive and emotional burden of learning programming. In this exploratory study, we characterize the attitudes and experiences of 672 undergraduate students as they used our online textbook as part of a 10-week introductory course in statistics. Students expressed negative attitudes and concerns related to R at the beginning of the course, but most developed more positive attitudes after engaging with course materials, regardless of demographic characteristics or prior programming experience. Analysis of a subgroup of students revealed that change in attitudes toward R may be linked to students' patterns of engagement over time and students' perceptions of the learning environment.

AB Aim/Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the extant research on data science education (DSE) to identify the existing gaps, opportunities, and challenges, and make rec-ommendations for current and future DSE. Background There has been an increase in the number of data science programs especially because of the increased appreciation of data as a multidisciplinary strategic re-source. This has resulted in a greater need for skills in data science to extract meaningful insights from data. However, the data science programs are not enough to meet the demand for data science skills. While there is growth in data science programs, they appear more as a rebranding of existing engineering, computer science, mathematics, and statistics programs. Methodology A scoping review was adopted for the period 2010-2021 using six scholarly multidisciplinary databases: Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Li-brary, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and the AIS Basket of eight journals. The study was narrowed down to 91 research articles and adopted a classification coding framework and correlation analysis for analysis. Contribution We theoretically contribute to the growing body of knowledge about the need to scale up data science through multidisciplinary pedagogies and disciplines as the demand grows. This paves the way for future research to understand which programs can provide current and future data scientists the skills and compe-tencies relevant to societal needs. Findings The key results revealed the limited emphasis on DSE, especially in non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines. In addition, the results identified the need to find a suitable pedagogy or a set of pedagogies because of the multidisciplinary nature of DSE. Further, there is currently no existing framework to guide the design and development of DSE at various ed-ucation levels, leading to sometimes inadequate programs. The study also noted the importance of various stakeholders who can contribute towards DSE and thus create opportunities in the DSE ecosystem. Most of the research studies reviewed were case studies that presented more STEM programs as compared to non-STEM. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers We recommend CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP -DM) as a framework to adopt collaborative pedagogies to teach data science. This research implies that it is important for academia, policymakers, and data science content developers to work closely with organizations to understand their needs. We recommend future research into programs that can provide current and fu-ture data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs and how interdisciplinarity within these programs can be integrated. Impact on Society Data science expertise is essential for tackling societal issues and generating beneficial effects. The main problem is that data is diverse and always changing, necessitating ongoing (up)skilling. Academic institutions must therefore stay current with new advances, changing data, and organizational requirements. In-dustry experts might share views based on their practical knowledge. The DSE ecosystem can be shaped by collaborating with numerous stakeholders and be-ing aware of each stakeholder's function in order to advance data science inter-nationally.
   Future Research The study found that there are a number of research opportunities that can be explored to improve the implementation of DSE, for instance, how can CRISP -DM be integrated into collaborative pedagogies to provide a fully comprehen-sive data science curriculum?

AB We live in a data-rich world with rapidly growing databases with zettabytes of data. Innovation, computation, and technological advances have now tremendously accelerated the pace of discovery, providing driverless cars, robotic devices, expert healthcare systems, precision medicine, and automated discovery to mention a few. Even though the definition of the term data science continues to evolve, the sweeping impact it has already produced on society is undeniable. We are at a point when new discoveries through data science have enormous potential to advance progress but also to be used maliciously, with harmful ethical and social consequences. Perhaps nowhere is this more clearly exemplified than in the biological and medical sciences. The confluence of (1) machine learning, (2) mathematical modeling, (3) computation/simulation, and (4) big data have moved us from the sequencing of genomes to gene editing and individualized medicine; yet, unsettled policies regarding data privacy and ethical norms could potentially open doors for serious negative repercussions. The data science revolution has amplified the urgent need for a paradigm shift in undergraduate biology education. It has reaffirmed that data science education interacts and enhances mathematical education in advancing quantitative conceptual and skill development for the new generation of biologists. These connections encourage us to strive to cultivate a broadly skilled workforce of technologically savvy problem-solvers, skilled at handling the unique challenges pertaining to biological data, and capable of collaborating across various disciplines in the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. To accomplish this, we suggest development of open curricula that extend beyond the job certification rhetoric and combine data acumen with modeling, experimental, and computational methods through engaging projects, while also providing awareness and deep exploration of their societal implications. This process would benefit from embracing the pedagogy of experiential learning and involve students in open-ended explorations derived from authentic inquiries and ongoing research. On this foundation, we encourage development of flexible data science initiatives for the education of life science undergraduates within and across existing models.

DE Algorithmic thinking; Data acumen; Education; Statistical analysis;
   Statistical computing; Workflow
AB Nolan and Temple Lang argued for the fundamental role of computing in the statistics curriculum. In the intervening decade, the statistics education community has acknowledged that computational skills are as important to statistics and data science practice as mathematics. There remains a notable gap, however, between our intentions and our actions. In this special issue of the Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, we have assembled a collection of articles that (1) suggest creative structures to integrate computing, (2) describe novel data science skills and habits, and (3) propose ways to teach computational thinking. We believe that it is critical for the community to redouble our efforts to embrace sophisticated computing in the statistics and data science curriculum. We hope that these articles provide useful guidance for the community to move these efforts forward.

AB This article reports on a multi-method study of a high school course in data science, finding that students who take data science take more mathematics courses than those who do not, there are more under-represented students in data science than is typical for other advanced mathematics courses; that the students who take data science are more positive about a future in STEM and they tend to be older. Analysis of writing from the students shows that students are very positive about the course, appreciating the relevance of the content, the opportunity to investigate ideas, the chance to learn challenging, applied content, and the opportunity to think creatively. In an assessment of data and functions given to students in data science and Algebra 2 courses, the students in data science scored at significantly higher levels.

AB Data science is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and subject matter expertise with the purpose to gain insights from relatively large sets of data. With elementary school age children as the target audience, we developed an educational collaborative game, Habitat Explorer for the MultiTaction display to introduce users to the core data science cycle components of data collection, exploration, and visualization. Users capture "sea creatures" in a collection jar, sort their collection into a data table, and then are able to create a bar chart visualization using their data. These components are interspersed with questions assessing user comprehension of the simple biological and data science concepts introduced during the game. The main goal of this research is to understand the potential of multi-touch displays to facilitate data science education with future aims to develop more complicated data exploration applications.

   equitable assessment
AB The COVID-19 pandemic caused the flaws of traditional grading systems to become even more apparent. In response, a growing number of educators are transitioning their classrooms to focus on alternative methods of assessment. These subversive methods promote more equitable assessments, as they provide a more accurate picture of what a student has learned, cultivate students' intrinsic motivation, and do not privilege students from certain backgrounds. This article details how alternative grading, specifically "ungrading," was integrated into an introductory data science course. I detail how the course components align with the principles of alternative grading, students' responses to the course structure, and the lessons I learned along the way. Finally, I close with a discussion of how infusing alternative methods of assessment into the classroom stands to cultivate the diversity continually lacking in computer science and data science.

AB Building on momentum in the computing community for more undergraduate experiential and interdisciplinary learning opportunities, our report details a novel approach to teaching data science in an archaeological field school study abroad context. Our structure included group and individual learning, and the flexible course design facilitated students' pursuit of their own interests via projects developed in partnership with domain experts. We provide reflections on the effectiveness of carrying out this flexible course design in the context of an interdisciplinary, domain-centered, data science course. This report also provides our reflections on the effectiveness of centering archaeological problems and using computational tools to teach responsible data practices emphasizing data collection, classification, analysis, visualization, translation, and storytelling. Finally, we explore some of the learning outcomes students demonstrated in their projects and their course reflections.

AB Smart Education is the influence of diverse technologies (Combinatorial Optimization, Machine Learning, Big Data, data visualisation, Internet of Education Things, Learning analytics, and others) to enhance the quality of education. In other words, Smart Education is the process of optimally managing human, economic and technological resources from educational institutions and research centres. Smart Education is part of the Smart Society (a component of a Smart City). The Smart Education components are the Internet of Education Things (Wireless Sensor Networks, RFID Technology), management of the education physical, infrastructure, smart classroom, smart campus, smart learning, Learning analytics, Smart Analysis, data science, Education Impact, and Educational Policy. This paper is a guide for understanding Smart Education components by presenting a survey of the characteristics, taxonomy (Education-Hard problems and Education-Soft problems), smart education indicators, history and future trends.

AB Data Science is becoming a field connecting multi-year development in areas such as Big Data and Data Analytics, and also applied domains like Bioengineering. Data Science education programs are rapidly being created on all levels. Usually it happens through reuse or renaming and can result in curricula that lack proper balance of competences, which balance is necessary for future data scientists. Our quantitative analysis of over 300 programs worldwide shows that at least one of the three core data science competence groups is under-represented in the majority of programs. Moreover, general business courses are often suggested to students to cover the domain competence group, which in most cases results in superficial treatment of this competence group. Our further qualitative analysis demonstrates that learning outcomes for most of the courses are usually not defined or defined improperly.

AB The advent of the big data era has elevated the importance of understanding, analyzing, and mining data, necessitating data science education with cognitive tools aiding data inquiry. However, limited appraisals exist, especially regarding diverse tools' impact on data inquiry cognitive aspects. This study addresses this void by examining cognitive tool impact on data inquiry. The study collected discourse and questionnaire data generated during online collaborative tasks. Epistemic network analysis and difference testing unveiled cognitive pattern disparities, learning motivation, cognitive load, and self-efficacy variations between groups. Block-based group displayed robust cognitive connections in data understanding and preparation. Text-based group focused on modeling and optimization iterations. Motivation and load didn't differ significantly, yet block-based group showed higher self-efficacy. Study concludes by acknowledging limitations and suggesting future research directions.

AB This paper reports on progress in the development of a teaching module on machine learning with decision trees for secondary-school students, in which students use survey data about media use to predict who plays online games frequently. This context is familiar to students and provides a link between school and everyday experience. In this module, they use CODAP's "Arbor" plug-in to manually build decision trees and understand how to systematically build trees based on data. Further on, the students use a menu-based environment in a Jupyter Notebook to apply an algorithm that automatically generates decision trees and to evaluate and optimize the performance of these. Students acquire technical and conceptual skills but also reflect on personal and social aspects of the uses of algorithms from machine learning.

AB We describe the design of Story Builder, a tool to support adolescents in building interactive multimedia stories that integrate data analysis and visualization with text, images, and other multimodal resources. Story Builder is a plug in for the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP), a free, online, open-source drag-anddrop interactive data analysis system. Based on early prototyping conducted with several 7th grade classrooms, we sought to design a tool that would allow students to (a) integrate their data investigations with relevant personal and contextual information; (b) record the step-by-step process and rationale of their data analysis; and (c) reflect on and share these contextual and process-oriented elements of data analysis work with others. A major goal of Story Builder is to encourage students to consider and incorporate personal, social, and scientific considerations during data analysis.

AB As data become more available and integrated into daily life, there has been growing interest in developing data science curricula for youth in conjunction with scientific practices and classroom technologies. However, the what and how of data science in pre-collegiate education have not yet reached consensus. This paper analyzes two prominent self-identified data science curricula, Introduction to Data Science (Gould et al. 2018) and Bootstrap: Data Science (Krishnamurthi et al. 2020), in order to ascertain what is thus far being presented to schools as data science. We highlight overlapping content and practices by the curricula while noting some key differences between the curricula and with professional practice. Moreover, we examine how lessons are structured and what kinds of data sets are used as well as introduce a measure of data set proximity. We conclude with some recommended areas for further coverage or elaboration in future iterations and future curricular efforts.

AB In 2010, Nolan and Temple Lang proposed "integration of computing concepts into statistics curricula at all levels." The unprecedented growth in data and emphasis on data science has provided an impetus to finally realizing full implementations of this in new statistics and data science programs and courses. We discuss a proposal for the stealth development of computational skills in students' exposure to introductory data science through careful, scaffolded exposure to computation and its power. Our intent is to support students, regardless of interest and self-efficacy in coding, in becoming data-driven learners, who are capable of asking complex questions about the world around them, and then answering those questions through the use of data-driven inquiry. Reference is made to the computer science and statistics consensus curriculum frameworks the International Data Science in Schools Project (IDSSP) recently published for secondary school data science or introductory tertiary programs, designed to optimize data-science accessibility.

AB Informed by critical data literacy efforts to promote social justice, this paper uses qualitative methods and data collected during two years of workplace ethnography to characterize the notion of critical novice data work. Specifically, we analyze everyday language used by novice data workers at DataWorks, an organization that trains and employs historically excluded populations to work with community data sets. We also characterize challenges faced by these workers in both cleaning and being critical of data during a project focused on police-community relations. Finally, we highlight novel approaches to visualizing data the workers developed during this project, derived from data cleaning and everyday experience. Findings and discussion highlight the generative power of everyday language and visualization for critical novice data work, as well as challenges and opportunities to foster critical data literacy with novice data workers in the workplace.

AB The growth of data science education at both graduate and undergraduate levels has increase dramatically. Need for computing platforms that are well-equip with the appropriate tools for students and instructors, and that are readily accessible and flexibly configurable has subsequently become more conspicuous. Using lots of sandboxes that would consume tremendous resources is not an effective solution. This paper propose a solution that design and implement Hadoop as a private online service that could effectively meet the design characteristics of an academic data science computing platform. The propose design emphasise a quick deployment solution based on available resources and technologies. The case study that follow demonstrate and cultivate our approach as a proof of concept for any academic institutions to implement their own services. This paper contains many aspects of service implementation from managing resources to choosing the right Hadoop platform components and solution to accounting for user authentication and authorisation as well as security and network design.

AB Teaching Data Science to traditional CS majors presents many challenges to students, faculty and the supporting infrastructure. When the student population changes from Computer Science students to those in an Information Technology program where many of the core CS courses are not required, additional challenges arise. Couple these challenges with teaching non-traditional students who are also involved with their families and careers; the difficulty in teaching this material rises exponentially. For our experiment, we chose to teach the Hadoop Distributed File System, the Map/Reduce paradigm, and basic Hadoop programming to expose these students to Data Science technologies. We will discuss our recent experience teaching Data Science to Information Technology students and the challenges we had to overcome, including missing distributed systems knowledge, a lack of basic Unix and operating systems understanding and a complete unfamiliarity with a Distributed File System.

AB There is growing interest in how to better prepare K-12 students to work with data. In this article, we assert that these discussions of teaching and learning must attend to the human dimensions of data work. Specifically, we draw from several established lines of research to argue that practices involving the creation and manipulation of data are shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural tools and practices, and political concerns. We demonstrate through two examples how our proposed humanistic stance highlights ways that efforts to make data personally relevant for youth also necessarily implicate cultural and sociopolitical dimensions that affect the design and learning opportunities in data-rich learning environments. We offer an interdisciplinary framework based on literature from multiple bodies of educational research to inform design, teaching and research for more effective, responsible, and inclusive student learning experiences with and about data.

AB Statistical modeling continues to gain prominence in the secondary curriculum, and recent recommendations to emphasize data science and computational thinking may soon position algorithmic models into the school curriculum. Many teachers' preparation for and experiences teaching statistical modeling have focused on probabilistic models. Subsequently, much of the research literature related to the teachers' understanding has focused on probabilistic models. This study explores the extent to which secondary statistics teachers appear to understand ideas of statistical modeling, specifically the processes of model building and evaluation, when introduced using classification trees, a type of algorithmic model. Results of this study suggest that while teachers were able to read and build classification tree models, they experienced more difficulty when evaluating models. Further research could continue to explore possible learning trajectories, technology tools, and pedagogical approaches for using classification trees to introduce ideas of statistical modeling.

DE Data Science Education; PDF Tables; Information Extraction
AB Data Science has been one of the most popular fields in higher education and research activities. It takes tons of time to read the experimental section of thousands of papers and figure out the performance of the data science techniques. In this work, we build an experimental evidence extraction system to automate the integration of tables (in the paper PDFs) into a database of experimental results. First, it crops the tables and recognizes the templates. Second, it classifies the column names and row names into "method", "dataset", or "evaluation metric", and then unified all the table cells into (method, dataset, metric, score)-quadruples. We propose hybrid features including structural and semantic table features as well as an ensemble learning approach for column/row name classification and table unification. SQL statements can be used to answer questions such as whether a method is the state-of-the-art or whether the reported numbers are conflicting.

AB When collecting data, science education researchers frequently have multiple respondents evaluate multiple artifacts using multiple criteria. Herein, the authors introduce Multifaceted Rasch Measurement (MFRM) analysis and explain why MFRM must be used when judges' data are collected. The authors use data from elementary science methods students enrolled in a senior-level, semester-length course. Acting as judges, students used the 23-item Elementary Science Teaching Analysis Matrix (ESTAM) instrument to evaluate five separate science lessons taught by five different teachers. Our MFRM analysis documents that multiple judges need not act as identical robots. Rather, differences in judges' severity can be computed and corrections made in an analysis to take into consideration differing judge severity. This paper extends the current literature in Science Education regarding the application of Rasch measurement. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Data is currently being produced at an incredible rate globally, fuelled by the increasing ubiquity of the Web, and stoked by social media, sensors, and mobile devices. However, as the amount of available data continues to increase, so does the demand for professionals who have the necessary skills to manage and manipulate this data. This paper presents the European Data Science Academy (EDSA), an initiative for bridging the data science skills gap across Europe and training a new generation of world-leading data scientists. The EDSA project has established a rigorous process and a set of best practices for the production and delivery of curricula for data science. Additionally, the project's efforts are dedicated to linking the demand for data science skills with the supply of learning resources that offer these skills. In order to achieve this, EDSA is offering interactive tools for finding learning resources and building personalised learning pathways towards acquiring the skills that are currently in demand.

AB The main focus of the technical application of this research relies on a web and mobile-based solution identified as Data Science Notebook named as DS Lab Notebook. Specifically, the main focus will be on tackling already present challenges in data science education and a solution presented around DS Lab, an interactive computational notebook. The core ideas are represented by the concept of extending the traditional computing notebooks, especially from the Jupyter family, with live visualizations, debugging, widgets, and interactivity during the educational process across all the major platforms: web, Android, and IOS. The features are outlined in several use cases that can be useful in the data-science teaching process, with a primary focus in matrix manipulations, scatter plots, and image filters. Python 3 was used as the main programming runtime and the back-end for providing access to variable values and type information is being described in the form of a runtime-independent pipeline relying on code parsing and injection.

AB Data scientists are information professionals who contribute to the collection, cleaning, transformation, analysis, visualization, and curation of large, heterogeneous data sets. Although some conceptions of data science focus primarily on analytical methods, data scientists must also have a deep understanding of how project data were collected, preprocessed and transformed. These processes strongly influence the analytical methods that can be applied, and more importantly how the results of those methods should be interpreted. In the present chapter we provide background information on educational challenges for data scientists and report on the results of a workshop where experts from the information field brainstormed on the educational dimensions of data science. Results of the workshop showed that data scientists must possess a breadth of expertise across three areas - curation, analytics, and cyber-infrastructure with deep knowledge in at least one of these areas. Workshop participants also underscored the importance of domain knowledge to the success of the data science role. Additionally, the workshop highlighted a factor that differentiates data science from other professional specialties: the emphasis on serving the data needs of information users and decision makers.

AB As data science is an evolving field, existing definitions reflect this uncertainty with overloaded terms and inconsistency. As a result of the field's fluidity, there is often a mismatch between what data-related programs teach, what employers expect, and the actual tasks data scientists are performing. In addition, the tools available to data scientists are not necessarily the tools being taught; textbooks do not seem to meet curricular needs; and empirical evidence does not seem to support existing program design. Currently, the field appears to be bifurcating into data science (DS) and data engineering (DE), with specific but overlapping roles in the combined data science and engineering (DSE) lifecycle. However, curriculum design has not yet caught up to this evolution. This working group report shows an empirical and data-driven view of the data-related education landscape, and includes several recommendations for both academia and industry that are based on this analysis.

AB As Data Science has recently become a trend of the innovation of building new academic programs in the U.S. higher education, a holistic review and analysis of the curriculum development in a close field called Informatics or Bioinformatics, occurred more than a decade ago, seems to be beneficial and necessary in helping and supporting the healthy growth of Data Science programs. In this paper, a thorough comparative study between Informatics and Data Science was presented through comparing and investigating the similarities and differences of their curriculum structures, bodies of domain knowledge, technical skill sets, research areas, faculty preparation, student background, as well as the lessons learnt from the development of Informatics programs and challenges in developing Data Science programs. It is believed that the recommendations drawn from this study will assist educators to build their Data Science programs with the confidence and determination but without hesitation and fear of misstepping along the way in promoting and building their new programs.

AB The information schools, also referred to as iField schools, are leaders in data science education. This study aims to develop a data science graduate curriculum model from an information science perspective to support iField schools in developing data science graduate education. In June 2020, information about 96 data science graduate programs from iField schools worldwide was collected and analyzed using a mixed research method based on inductive content analysis. A wide range of data science competencies and skills development and 12 knowledge topics covered by the curriculum were obtained. The humanistic model is further taken as the theoretical and methodological basis for course model construction, and 12 course knowledge topics are reconstructed into 4 course modules, including (a) data-driven methods and techniques; (b) domain knowledge; (c) legal, moral, and ethical aspects of data; and (d) shaping and developing personal traits, and human-centered data science graduate curriculum model is formed. At the end of the study, the wide application prospect of this model is discussed.

AB Despite the elevated importance of Data Science in Statistics, there exists limited research investigating how students learn the computing concepts and skills necessary for carrying out data science tasks. Computer Science educators have investigated how students debug their own code and how students reason through foreign code. While these studies illuminate different aspects of students' programming behavior or conceptual understanding, a method has yet to be employed that can shed light on students' learning processes. This type of inquiry necessitates qualitative methods, which allow for a holistic description of the skills a student uses throughout the computing code they produce, the organization of these descriptions into themes, and a comparison of the emergent themes across students or across time. In this article we share how to conceptualize and carry out the qualitative coding process with students' computing code. Drawing on the Block Model to frame our analysis, we explore two types of research questions which could be posed about students' learning. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

TI Hack weeks as a model for data science education and collaboration

DE data science; education; interdisciplinary collaboration;

AB Across many scientific disciplines, methods for recording, storing, and analyzing data are rapidly increasing in complexity. Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers. Based on our results, we conclude that hack weeks present an effective, easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to positively impact data analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster collaboration, and cultivate best practices.

AB In this article, we consider how to make data more meaningful to students through the choice of data and the activities we use them in drawing upon students lived experiences more in the teaching of statistics and data science courses. In translating scholarship around culturally relevant pedagogy from the fields of education and mathematics education we develop the idea of culturally relevant data. We see this development as a key ingredient to implementing culturally relevant pedagogy in teaching data-intensive courses leveraging the centrality of context through data in both statistics and data science to engage students particularly from historically marginalized groups in STEM. We provide suggestions as to ways of finding or creating culturally relevant data and using them in implementing culturally relevant pedagogy to support the learning and flourishing of students in statistics and data science courses. We also present findings from pilot work we have done in implementing these data in statistics courses. Finally, we discuss lingering questions and possible next steps for research in this area. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

TI EVALUATION EDISON'S DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCY FRAMEWORK THROUGH A
   COMPARATIVE LITERATURE ANALYSIS
SO FOUNDATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Data Science; Data Science Education; Curricular Recommendations; Data
   Science Body of Knowledge; EDISON
AB During the emergence of Data Science as a distinct discipline, discussions of what exactly constitutes Data Science have been a source of contention, with no clear resolution. These disagreements have been exacerbated by the lack of a clear single disciplinary 'parent.' Many early efforts at defining curricula and courses exist, with the EDISON Project's Data Science Frame-work (EDISON-DSF) from the European Union being the most complete. The EDISON-DSF includes both a Data Science Body of Knowledge (DS-BoK) and Competency Framework (CF-DS). This paper takes a critical look at how EDISON's CF-DS compares to recent work and other published curricular or course materials. We identify areas of strong agreement and disagreement with the framework. Results from the literature analysis provide strong insights into what topics the broader community see as belonging in (or not in) Data Science, both at curricular and course levels. This analysis can provide important guidance for groups working to formalize the discipline and any college or university looking to build their own undergraduate Data Science degree or programs.

AB Data is increasingly shaping the way people interact with each other and the world more broadly. For youth growing up in an increasingly data-driven society, it is critical they have foundational data literacy skills. A central component of data literacy is the ability to collect, analyze, visualize, and make meaning from data. All of these activities are mediated and shaped by the tools that youth use to carry out these data practices. Given the essential role tools play in enabling and supporting youth in engaging with and interpreting data, understanding what tools are used and how they are used in educational contexts will help us understand how youth are being prepared to be data-literate citizens. In this paper, we present the analysis of the data collection and analysis tools used in 4 widely adopted high school data science curricula. The analysis attends to both what tools are used as well as what datasets they are used to analyze. This work contributes to our understanding of the way youth are being introduced to concepts and practices from the field of data science and the role the tools play in shaping those experiences.

AB Although Productive Failure has shown to be effective (Kapur, 2016; Loibl, Roll, & Rummel, 2017), it is not clear if failure in problem-solving is necessary. Initial work in a quasi-experimental setting suggests that explicitly designing for experiences of failure leads to better learning outcomes than designing for success. We build on this to report on a controlled experimental study where students are exposed to failure-driven, success-driven, or no explicit scaffolding in problem-solving prior to instruction. For assessments of non-isomorphic conceptual understanding, our results align with those from prior work. Despite the similarity in posttest scores, students exposed to failure-driven scaffolding demonstrate higher quality of constructive reasoning than those receiving success-driven scaffolding. Additionally, our study reveals learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding (for both posttest scores and reasoning quality) on assessments of transfer. Several cognitive, affective and meta-cognitive mechanisms are investigated to explain robust learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding in preparatory problem-solving.

AB Abstract-Nolan and Temple Lang's Computing in the Statistics Curricula (2010) advocated for a shift in statistical education to broadly include computing. In the time since, individuals with training in both computing and statistics have become increasingly employable in the burgeoning data science field. In response, universities have developed new courses and programs to meet the growing demand for data science education. To address this demand, we created Data Science in Practice, a large-enrollment undergraduate course. Here, we present our goals for teaching this course, including: (1) conceptualizing data science as creative problem solving, with a focus on project-based learning, (2) prioritizing practical application, teaching and using standardized tools and best practices, and (3) scaling education through coursework that enables hands-on and classroom learning in a large-enrollment course. Throughout this course we also emphasize social context and data ethics to best prepare students for the interdisciplinary and impactful nature of their work. We highlight creative problem solving and strategies for teaching automation-resilient skills, while providing students the opportunity to create a unique data science project that demonstrates their technical and creative capacities.

   Relationships in Informal Open-Ended Data Exploration
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES

DT Article
AB Engaging learners with complex unfamiliar datasets is a known challenge in Data Science education. One promising phenomenon investigated in related work is perspective-taking. A first-person "actor" perspective can help facilitate group and individual sensemaking by mediating observations and actions taken by learners. Here we investigate how museum visitors made use of an actor perspective when exploring an open-ended, interactive data map museum exhibit. We use a mix of qualitative and quantitative empirical methods to explore how actor perspective-taking (APT) may mediate joint sensemaking around data visualizations. By applying interpretive coding to 54 conversations wherein APT naturalistically emerged, we identify 3 distinct self-to-data relationships constructed via APT: role-play, projection, and orientation. A further analysis explores how APT was embedded in joint sensemaking of the visualized data. Twelve APT-mediated sensemaking processes are identified; two (extrapolating and noticing absence) were used in conjunction with multiple APT self-to-data relationships, while the remaining ten (e.g., enacting, spatially characterizing, generalizing) were exclusively used with specific self-to-data APT relationships. We use these empirical findings to generate hypotheses about how APT and associated sensemaking processes may support Data Science learning goals.

DT Article
AB Open large-scale datasets (LSDS) and data visualization technologies are new cultural tools that have potential to inform public dialogue and learning about important socioeconomic and scientific matters, particularly if the data is used to consider both personal and shared experiences. This paper reports on a design study in which diverse middle and high school youth in a free summer workshop at an urban public library were asked to model their family geobiographies, or their personal family migration stories, with socioeconomic LSDS. Youth represented family decision-making and social conditions that might have motivated family movements with online, dynamic data modeling and mapping tools (Gapminder.org; SocialExplorer.com). The qualitative video analysis examined participants' experiences and learning in storytelling and modeling the family geobiography, focusing on multimodal talk-in-interaction to understand how the study design engaged learners' capacities, histories, and imagined futures in relation to the LSDS and supported learning about oneself and society. Grounded examples from two family cases are used to illustrate how participants placed their families and selves into data ontologies and the role of family members in composing storylines.

AB In today's information age, developing data science competencies has become vital to fostering responsible citizenry. However, the actual techniques learners need to become proficient in are still somewhat "in-construction", as the relatively new field of data science is constantly expanding to meet new data-related demands. Data science education needs to develop innovative means to keep up with this expansion that focus less on proficiency in specific techniques, but rather introduce novices to authentic data practices, and the authentic purposes directing the authentic practices. This paper focuses on a specific practice, the use of simulations to generate and examine data, in the context of authentic scientific Citizen Science research. We provide a case study of one pair of middle school students' engagement in an extended learning sequence including simulation activities inspired by authentic data practices, adapted to also be authentic for young students. While the simulation activity was inspired by the scientists' purposes, our findings illustrate four different actual purposes the students attributed to it. We also show that as the students deepened their engagement with the simulation, they gradually appropriated its intended purpose, alongside articulating more mature views of data-related concepts. The conclusions summarize the four different purposes the students expressed and identify aspects of design that contributed to the gradual re-shaping process of their actual purposes. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Introducing students to data science and statistics has become essential nowadays. Students need to be introduced to authentic data practices, but also to the authentic purposes motivating these practices. Utilizing computerized simulations is a common authentic practice in science and statistics. The pedagogical, intended, use of computerized simulations can be inspired by the authentic purposes but should also be adapted to be authentic for the students. Students may have actual purposes that differ from the authentic and intended purposes. What this paper adds A case study of a pair of middle school students' engagement with a computerized simulation tool, as part of their participation in a Citizen Science project. The students expressed four actual purposes for the simulation. The students' initial purposes differed from the intended purposes, limiting their participation. Key aspects of the overall activity design ultimately supported the students to appropriate the intended purpose of the simulation and more deeply engage with the intended statistical notions. Implications for practice and/or policy It is important to consider that students may attribute purposes that differ from those of the teacher or the activity designer, to any learning activity they engage in. Making the intended purposes more explicit may be helpful, but potentially not enough for students to appropriate them. Researchers' prompts, students' freedom to reshape their use of the simulation tool and productive discussion norms can be beneficial aspects.

AB Many universities are offering data science (DS) courses to fulfill the growing demands for skilled DS practitioners. Assignments and projects are essential parts of the DS curriculum as they enable students to gain hands-on experience in real-world DS tasks. However, most current assignments and projects are lacking in at least one of two ways: 1) they do not comprehensively teach all the steps involved in the complete workflow of DS projects; 2) students work on separate problems individually or in small teams, limiting the scale and impact of their solutions. To overcome these limitations, we envision novel synergistic modular assignments where a large number of students work collectively on all the tasks required to develop a large-scale DS product. The resulting product can be continuously improved with students' contributions every semester.
   We report our experience with developing and deploying such an assignment in an Information Retrieval course. Through the assignment, students collectively developed a search engine for finding expert faculty specializing in a given field. This shows the utility of such assignments both for teaching useful DS skills and driving innovation and research. We share useful lessons for other instructors to adopt similar assignments for their DS courses.

AB Data science is inherently collaborative as individuals across fields and sectors use quantitative data to answer relevant questions. As a result, there is a growing body of research regarding how to teach interdisciplinary collaboration skills. However, much of the work evaluating methods of teaching statistics and data science collaboration relies primarily on self-reflection data. Additionally, prior research lacks detailed methods for assessing the quality of collaboration skills. In this case study, we present a method for teaching statistics and data science collaboration, a framework for identifying elements of effective collaboration, and a comparative case study to evaluate the collaboration skills of both a team of students and an experienced collaborator on two components of effective data science collaboration: structuring a collaboration meeting and communicating with a domain expert. Results show that the students could facilitate meetings and communicate comparably well to the experienced collaborator, but that the experienced collaborator was better able to facilitate meetings and communicate to develop strong relationships, an important element for high-quality and long-term collaboration. Further work is needed to generalize these findings to a larger population, but these results begin to inform the field regarding effective ways to teach specific data science collaboration skills.

AB Student attrition is a challenge experienced by higher education institutions. One of the key reasons for student attrition is the inability of students to develop an identity and a sense of belonging. This study aims to understand the role of a data science learning community in helping students to develop identity and a sense of belonging. The study used a mixed-methods approach to collect and analyze the data. The study used a pre-post survey to understand students' perceptions regarding identity formation and sense of belonging. The results of the survey study indicated that the perception of identity formation and sense of belonging increased as students progressed through the semester. To further investigate the reasons for the increase in the perception of identity formation and sense of belonging, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted. The results of the interview revealed that living in the data science learning community, participating in various events and interacting with faculty, staff and working with peers of similar interest helped students to develop a data science identity and leader identity, as well as experience sense of belonging.

   experience; Two-year community college
AB Two-year colleges provide the opportunity for students of all ages to try new subjects, change careers, upskill, or begin exploring higher education, at affordable rates. Many might begin their exploration by taking a course at a local two-year college. Currently, not many of these institutions in the U.S. offer data science courses. This article introduces the perspective lens of students who have gone through the Montgomery College Data Science Certificate Program. We found that, contrary to many other educational fields at the College, data science students tend to come from diverse backgrounds and career paths. A common theme emerged that all students learned valuable skills and applications such as coding in various programming languages and approaches to machine learning. Other meaningful themes included an appreciation of course accessibility, especially catered toward busy professionals who might only be able to take evening courses. Students appreciated learning that data science and ethics are intertwined. Finally, it was evident that going through the data science program positively impacted the lives and careers of these students. The implications of the themes of these student experiences are discussed as they relate to data science education. for this article are available online.

AB Much guidance on statistical training in STEM fields has been focused largely on the undergraduate cohort, with graduate education often being absent from the equation. Training in quantitative methods and reasoning is critical for graduate students in biomedical and science programs to foster reproducible and responsible research practices. We argue that graduate student education should more center around fundamental reasoning and integration skills rather than mainly on listing 1 statistical test method after the other without conveying the bigger context picture or critical argumentation skills that will enable student to improve research integrity through rigorous practice. Herein, we describe the approach we take in a quantitative reasoning course in the R3 program at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with an error-focused lens, based on visualization and communication competencies. Specifically, we take this perspective stemming from the discussed causes of irreproducibility and apply it specifically to the many aspects of good statistical practice in science, ranging from experimental design to data collection and analysis, and conclusions drawn from the data. We also provide tips and guidelines for the implementation and adaptation of our course material to various graduate biomedical and STEM science programs.

AB Data science is collaborative and its students should learn teamwork and collaboration. Yet it can be a challenge to fit the teaching of such skills into the data science curriculum. Team-Based Learning (TBL) is a pedagogical strategy that can help educators teach data science better by flipping the classroom to employ small-group collaborative learning to actively engage students in doing data science. A consequence of this teaching method is helping students achieve the workforce-relevant data science learning goals of effective communication, teamwork, and collaboration. We describe the essential elements of TBL: accountability structures and feedback mechanisms to support students collaborating within permanent teams on well-designed application exercises to do data science. The results of our case study of using TBL to teach a modern, introductory data science course indicate that the course effectively taught reproducible data science workflows, beginning R programming, and communication and collaboration. Students also reported much room for improvement in their learning of statistical thinking and advanced R concepts. To help the data science education community adopt this appealing pedagogical strategy, we outline steps for deciding on using TBL, preparing and planning for it, and overcoming potential pitfalls when using TBL to teach data science.

AB With the rising demand for data science skills, the ability to wrangle data programmatically becomes a crucial barrier. In this paper, we discuss the centrality of API (application programming interface) lookup to data wrangling, and how an ontology-structured command menu could facilitate it. We design thumbnail graphics as visual alternatives to explaining data wrangling operations and use a survey to validate their quality. We furthermore predict that thumbnail graphics make the menu more navigable, improving lookup efficiency and performance. Our predictions are tested using SLICE N DICE, an online data wrangling tutorial platform that collects learner activity. It includes both non-programmatic and programmatic data wrangling exercises. Participants from a multi-institutional sample (n=200) were randomly assigned the tutorial either with or without thumbnail graphics. Our results show that thumbnail graphics reduce the need for clarifications, thereby assisting API lookup for novices learning data wrangling. We further present some negative results regarding performance gain and follow up with a discussion on why the differences are subtle and how they can be improved. Last but not least, we complement our statistical results with a qualitative study where we receive positive feedback from our participants on the design and helpfulness of the thumbnail graphics.

AB Support vector classifiers are one of the most popular linear classification techniques for binary classification. Different from some commonly seen model fitting criteria in statistics, such as the ordinary least squares criterion and the maximum likelihood method, its algorithm depends on an optimization problem under constraints, which is unconventional to many students in a second or third course in statistics or data science. As a result, this topic is often not as intuitive to students as some of the more traditional statistical modeling tools. In order to facilitate students' mastery of the topic and promote active learning, we developed some in-class activities and their accompanying Shiny applications for teaching support vector classifiers. The designed course materials aim at engaging students through group work and solidifying students' understanding of the algorithm via hands-on explorations. The Shiny applications offer interactive demonstration of the changes of the components of a support vector classifier when altering its determining parameters. With the goal of benefiting the broader statistics and data science education community, we have made the developed Shiny applications publicly available. In addition, a detailed in-class activity worksheet and a real data example are also provided in the online .

AB The availability of massive datasets in genetics, neuroimaging, mobile health, and other subfields of biology and medicine promises new insights but also poses significant challenges. To realize the potential of big data in biomedicine, the National Institutes of Health launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative, funding several centers of excellence in biomedical data analysis and a Training Coordinating Center (TCC) tasked with facilitating online and in-person training of biomedical researchers in data science. A major initiative of the BD2K TCC is to automatically identify, describe, and organize data science training resources available on the Web and provide personalized training paths for users. In this paper, we describe the construction of ERuDIte, the Educational Resource Discovery Index for Data Science, and its release as linked data. ERuDIte contains over 11,000 training resources including courses, video tutorials, conference talks, and other materials. The metadata for these resources is described uniformly using Schema.org. We use machine learning techniques to tag each resource with concepts from the Data Science Education Ontology, which we developed to further describe resource content. Finally, we map references to people and organizations in learning resources to entities in DBpedia, DBLP, and ORCID, embedding our collection in the web of linked data. We hope that ERuDIte will provide a framework to foster open linked educational resources on the Web.

AB Demand for data science education is surging and traditional courses offered by statistics departments are not meeting the needs of those seeking training. This has led to a number of opinion pieces advocating for an update to the Statistics curriculum. The unifying recommendation is that computing should play a more prominent role. We strongly agree with this recommendation, but advocate the main priority is to bring applications to the forefront as proposed by Nolan and Speed in 1999. We also argue that the individuals tasked with developing data science courses should not only have statistical training, but also have experience analyzing data with the main objective of solving real-world problems. Here, we share a set of general principles and offer a detailed guide derived from our successful experience developing and teaching a graduate-level, introductory data science course centered entirely on case studies. We argue for the importance of statistical thinking, as defined by Wild and Pfannkuch in 1999 and describe how our approach teaches students three key skills needed to succeed in data science, which we refer to as creating, connecting, and computing. This guide can also be used for statisticians wanting to gain more practical knowledge about data science before embarking on teaching an introductory course.

AB We live in an increasingly data-driven world, where high-throughput sequencing and mass spectrometry platforms are transforming biology into an information science. This has shifted major challenges in biological research from data generation and processing to interpretation and knowledge translation. However, postsecondary training in bioinformatics, or more generally data science for life scientists, lags behind current demand. In particular, development of accessible, undergraduate data science curricula has the potential to improve research and learning outcomes as well as better prepare students in the life sciences to thrive in public and private sector careers. Here, we describe the Experiential Data science for Undergraduate Cross-Disciplinary Education (EDUCE) initiative, which aims to progressively build data science competency across several years of integrated practice. Through EDUCE, students complete data science modules integrated into required and elective courses augmented with coordinated cocurricular activities. The EDUCE initiative draws on a community of practice consisting of teaching assistants (TAs), postdocs, instructors, and research faculty from multiple disciplines to overcome several reported barriers to data science for life scientists, including instructor capacity, student prior knowledge, and relevance to discipline-specific problems. Preliminary survey results indicate that even a single module improves student self-reported interest and/or experience in bioinformatics and computer science. Thus, EDUCE provides a flexible and extensible active learning framework for integration of data science curriculum into undergraduate courses and programs across the life sciences.

AB Data Visualization addresses the use of graphics with the purpose to obtain or transmit the knowledge in a easier and faster way, this is it main, and in many cases unique purpose. Since their invention Data graphics has evolved and many techniques has been developed, and in the last decades, with the definition and evolution of the Data Science, Data Visualization has become to be used profusely, in that manner that, by one side, the Data Science Body of Knowledge, DS-BoK, define five knowledge area groups that should be taught when learning Data Science, in all of them Data Visualization is taken a main role for different reasons applying each knowledge area; and by other side all the Data Science development environments, open source or proprietary, include tools for performing Data Visualizations. This paper presents the results of a research carried out with the main objective of improving the teaching of data visualization using two ways: propose a new system to classify the large amount of different graphical techniques for presenting data that can be found in the literature; and analyze using different attributes quite all the most important different tools, open source and private, that are available to develop data graphics mainly form a data visualization teaching point of view.

AB Classification, a fundamental data analytics task, has widespread applications across various academic disciplines, such as marketing, finance, sociology, psychology, education, and public health. Its versatility enables researchers to explore diverse research questions and extract valuable insights from data. Therefore, it is crucial to extend familiarity with classification methods to non-STEM students, who will encounter such problems in their professional careers. To address this need, this article presents a data science course for non-STEM students on classification methods. The course's difficulty level is influenced by factors such as students' backgrounds and the prerequisites and requirements set by the offering department. The suggested course framework begins with data preparation and provides students with a comprehensive toolbox comprising methodical techniques and software tools for classification. This course guides students toward discovering new knowledge and insights about classification and interpretation. The teaching approach emphasizes the dynamic process involved in classification, encompassing grasping the analytical task, understanding terms and concepts, visualizing the classification, analyzing data, interpreting results, and drawing conclusions. This course also combines project-based learning, open discussions, and even competitions among class participants. Incorporating practical projects that involve interaction and decision-making within a quantitative course can be highly beneficial. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB Recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a revolutionary and versatile tool transforming industry applications and generating new and improved capabilities for scientific discovery and model building. The adoption of DL in hydrology has so far been gradual, but the field is now ripe for breakthroughs. This paper suggests that DLbased methods can open up a complementary avenue toward knowledge discovery in hydrologic sciences. In the new avenue, machine-learning algorithms present competing hypotheses that are consistent with data. Interrogative methods are then invoked to interpret DL models for scientists to further evaluate. However, hydrology presents many challenges for DL methods, such as data limitations, heterogeneity and co-evolution, and the general inexperience of the hydrologic field with DL. The roadmap toward DL-powered scientific advances will require the coordinated effort from a large community involving scientists and citizens. Integrating process-based models with DL models will help alleviate data limitations. The sharing of data and baseline models will improve the efficiency of the community as a whole. Open competitions could serve as the organizing events to greatly propel growth and nurture data science education in hydrology, which demands a grassroots collaboration. The area of hydrologic DL presents numerous research opportunities that could, in turn, stimulate advances in machine learning as well.

DE Gender and Racial Equity; Machine Learning; Data Science; Education
AB Data Science has recently experienced a significant surge in producing undergraduate degree/certificate and course enrollments. This growth has resulted in straining program resources at many institutions and causing concern about how to most effectively respond to the rapidly growing demand and provide equal opportunities for all students to pursue their degree. The primary goal of this work is to provide an intelligent solution to automatically identify biases related to race and gender in the content of Data Science related courses such as Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Mining, Data Analytics, and Knowledge Discovery just to name a few. While machine learning allows to build powerful predicting tools, it hasn't been used sufficiently to detect biases rooted in gender and race in educational material. Hence, using effective machine learning techniques we aim to enhance the success rate of undergraduate students in Data Science education and programs while promoting engagement through identifying and mitigating potential gender and racial biases. To this end, we propose a novel bias detection approach which uses a combination of gender identification and sentiment classification for characterization of gender and race in educational contents. Our proposed framework can help educators and course developers to mitigate race and gender biases in their course materials and create an equitable learning experience for students of minority and under-represented groups.

DE Data Science Education; Computer Science Education; Curriculum Design
AB As a fast-growing field with widespread impact on economy and its promising hiring potential, Data Science has been enthusiastically sought-out by many disciplines in the academia, including Mathematics, Statistics, Library Science, Management Information Systems, as well as Computer Science, as an attracting area for recruiting students, soliciting grants, and expanding their existing programs. Although some standalone programs in Data Science have been established around the country, many institutions encounter the challenges in balancing the curricula among different disciplines, allocating new resources, and cooperating with the existing majors regarding enrollment management, student advising, and faculty preparation. In this paper, a strategy-based framework is proposed for those who have limited resources of all kinds to introduce Data Science through their existing Computer Science programs at a baccalaureate level with a minimum curriculum disruption. Instead of a standalone program, to embed Data Science into Computer Science education is demonstrated to be a practical, effective, cost-saving approach based on an extensive study of the synergy between Data Science and Computer Science education. While the proposed framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach, it provides a doable route for blending Data Science into Computer Science education in systematic ways. It has become the consensus that an adequate exposure to Data Science will better prepare computer science students for taking the challenges in this ever-changing, data embraced world.

AB The Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ) published a curriculum standard for university-level education majoring in data science (DS) (An English translation of the IPSJ Data Science Curriculum Standard is available at: https://www.ipthree.org/wp-content/uploads/IPSJ-DS-Cuniculum_202104_en.pdf). In this paper, we shall report strategy and development of the DS curriculum standards. Data science education and the development of data scientists are recognised to be quite important in both social and business contexts. The IPSJ DS curriculum standard is developed by integrating various related initiatives and has the following unique features. (1) The DS curriculum standard covers a wide range of related fields to ensure international compatibility through mapping to the ACM Data Science curriculum and the European EDISON Data Science Framework. (2) It collaborates with the IPSJ Data Scientist certification (under development) by referring to the Data Scientist skill checklist (assistant level) developed by the Data Scientist Society of Japan. (3) It clarifies the knowledge and skills required of students majoring in data science. (4) It assigns a time to each educational content so that the curriculum size becomes approximately 675 class hours (60 credits in the Japanese credit system). (5) It collaborates with the Model Curriculum for Mathematics, Data Science and AI Education (literacy level) developed by the Japan Inter-University Consortium for Mathematics and Data Science, supported by the Japanese government.

AB Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have been shown to be highly effective at promoting learning as compared to other computer-based instructional approaches. However, many ITS rely heavily on expert design and hand-crafted rules. This makes them difficult to build and transfer across domains and limits their potential efficacy. In this paper, we investigate how feedback in a large-scale ITS can be automatically generated in a data-driven way, and more specifically how personalization of feedback can lead to improvements in student performance outcomes. First, in this paper we propose a machine learning approach to generate personalized feedback in an automated way, which takes individual needs of students into account, while alleviating the need of expert intervention and design of hand-crafted rules. We leverage state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to provide students with personalized feedback using hints and Wikipedia-based explanations. Second, we demonstrate that personalized feedback leads to improved success rates at solving exercises in practice: our personalized feedback model is used in Korbit, a large-scale dialogue-based ITS with around 20,000 students launched in 2019. We present the results of experiments with students and show that the automated, data-driven, personalized feedback leads to a significant overall improvement of 22.95% in student performance outcomes and substantial improvements in the subjective evaluation of the feedback.

AB The prevalence of data across all disciplines and the large workforce demand from industry has led to the rise in interest of data science courses. Educators are increasingly recognizing the value of building communities of practice, adapting and translating courses and programs that have been shown to be successful, and sharing lessons learned in increasing diversity in data science education. We describe and analyze our experiences translating a lower-division data science curriculum from one university, University of California, Berkeley, to another setting with very different student populations and institutional context, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). We present our findings from student interviews across two semesters of the course offering at UMBC, specifically focusing on the challenges and positive experiences that the students had in the UMBC course. We highlight lessons learned to reflect on the existing large scale program at UC Berkeley, its adaptation and opportunities for increasing diversity in new settings. Our findings emphasize the importance of adapting courses and programs to existing curricula, student populations, cyberinfrastructure, and faculty and staff resources. Smaller class sizes open up the possibility of more individualized assignments, tailored to the majors, career interests, and social change motivations of diverse students. While students across institutional contexts may need varying degrees of support, we found that often students from diverse backgrounds, if engaged deeply, show significant enthusiasm for data science and its applications.

AB Educating young learners to reason with data is increasingly important given our data saturated society; yet teachers need support in recognizing and facilitating apt epistemic performance (which involves the beliefs and practices necessary to successfully establish, critique, and use data and knowledge within a domain) regarding data literacy with elementary students. In this exploratory study, we aimed to understand (a) what apt epistemic processes within data literacy look like in practice with children, and (b) to what extent a curriculum built on a simulation-based data analysis intervention (where students engage in experimentation and data analyses through the use of simulations) promotes the epistemic processes of data literacy. We used the Apt-AIR framework, which expounds on the components needed for successful epistemic education, as a tool to identify students' apt epistemic processes. The results illustrate that elementary students were able to activate cognitive, emotional, and-to a lesser extent-metacognitive and collaborative epistemic processes related to data literacy skills in this context. Additionally, the design features embedded in the experimentation lesson were more successful in engaging students in apt epistemic processes; yet the data analysis lesson, while engaging students in fewer processes overall, was successful in promoting students' ability to make accurate inferences using an aggregate view of data. We discuss the trends in the apt epistemic processes related to data literacy that emerged and their implications for instruction and learning.

AB Although existing data science educational programmes develop talent and produce graduates, business-focused data science curricula comprising essential skills oriented to business and managerial data with associated analysis, remain underserved. Current pedagogy has focused either on data science or on purely analytic technical aspects. There is therefore, an opportunity to rethink how institutions can develop innovative data-focussed education programmes, addressing both modern industry and community demands. As both academia and industry strive to integrate applied learning, transferable and enterprise skills into business and sciences, this paper proposes a design based research approach (DBR) for designing such a new interdisciplinary data science teaching curriculum as a foundation to deliver business undergraduate degrees in Business Data Science. Adopting a design science method our proposed DBR illustrates effective utilities for conceptualising and evaluating a fully functional new degree programme - Bachelor of Business Data Science. Ten senior business information systems academics and five analytics industry practitioners in Victoria, Australia were interviewed in three iterative prototyping phases followed by a final focus group session with business information systems students that evaluated the proposed structure. The findings suggest that proposed DBR ensures the design of an innovative data science degree that may meet growing industry and interdisciplinary demands. The paper concludes by discussing overall feasibility of the proposal in the Australian higher education sector, particularly for the case context of an Australian University.

AB Data visualizations have proliferated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to communicate information about the crisis and influence policy development and individual decision-making. In invoking exponential growth, mathematical modelling, statistical analysis, and the like, these data visualizations invite opportunities for mathematics teaching and learning. Yet data visualizations are social texts, authored from specific points of view, that narrate particular, and often consequential, stories. Their fundamental reliance on quantification and mathematics cements their social positioning as supposedly objective, reliable, and neutral. The reading of any data visualization demands unpacking the role of mathematics, including how data and variables have been formatted and how relationships are framed to narrate stories from particular points of view. We present an approach to a critical reading of data visualizations for the context of mathematics education that draws on three interrelated concepts: mathematical formatting (what gets quantified, measured, and how), framing (how variables are related and through what kind of data visualization), and narrating (which stories the data visualization tells, its potential impacts and limits). This approach to reading data visualisations includes a process of reimagining through reformatting, reframing and renarrating. We illustrate this approach and these three concepts using data visualizations published in the New York Times in 2020 about COVID-19. We offer a set of possible questions to guide a critical reading of data visualizations, beyond this set of examples.

AB Several studies indicate that there are no enough people in the market with data science skills and even those graduates in ICT from universities do not possess skills required by employers. Thus, researchers have suggested the urgency for universities to review their curricular as the world is heading towards data era. The aim of this research was to analyze the current skill-gaps needs from stakeholders and opportunities to establish data science postgraduate programme that reflects the current technological trends and market demands at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM). A questionnaire was administered to 85 identified organizations to solicit information on the needs for data scientists and existing skill gaps. A total of 61 filled questionnaires response were received out of the 85 that were administered to selected organizations indicating a turn out rate of over 70%. Overall the analyzed data articulated a compelling evidence for the local industry growing need for data scientist. The survey that was conducted was followed up by conduct of various workshops and meetings to solicit inputs from different experts and stakeholders on different versions of the developed curriculum. Finally, a new programme in MSc in data Science was approved and established from April 2018 at UDSM. Despite its late approval and without formal advertisement on the public media, the programme attracted a large number of applicants for 2018/19 academic year, compared to other several postgraduate programmes in ICT offered at UDSM.

AB Today, corporates are moving toward the adoption of Design-Thinking techniques to develop products and services, putting their consumer as the heart of the development process. Tim Brown, president, and CEO of IDEO, defines design thinking as "A human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success". The application of design thinking has been witnessed to be the road to develop innovative applications, interactive systems, scientific software, healthcare application, and even to utilize Design Thinking to re-think business operation as the case of Airbnb. Recently, there has been a movement to apply design thinking to machine learning and artificial intelligence to ensure creating the "waw" affect to consumers. ACM Taskforce on Data Science program states that "Data Scientists should be able to implement and understand algorithms for data collection and analysis. They should understand the time and space considerations of algorithms. They should follow good design principles developing software, understanding the importance of those principles for testability and maintainability" However, this definition hides the user behind the machine who works on data preparation, algorithm selection and model interpretation. Thus, Data Science program to include design thinking to ensure meeting the user demands, generating more usable machine learning tools, and developing new ways of framing computational thinking In this poster, we describe the motivation behind injecting DT in Data Science programs, an example course, its learning objective and teaching modules.

AB PurposeThis study is part of a participatory design research project and aims to develop and study pedagogical frameworks and tools for integrating computational thinking (CT) concepts and data science practices into elementary school classrooms.Design/methodology/approachThis paper describes a pedagogical approach that uses a data science framework the research team developed to assist teachers in providing data science instruction to elementary-aged students. Using phenomenological case study methodology, the authors use classroom observations, student focus groups, video recordings and artifacts to detail ways learners engage in data science practices and understand how they perceive their engagement during activities and learning.FindingsFindings suggest student engagement in data science is enhanced when data problems are contextualized and connected to students' lived experiences; data analysis and data-based decision-making is practiced in multiple ways; and students are given choices to communicate patterns, interpret graphs and tell data stories. The authors note challenges students experienced with data practices including conflict between inconsistencies in data patterns and lived experiences and focusing on data visualization appearances versus relationships between variables.Originality/valueData science instruction in elementary schools is an understudied, emerging and important area of data science education. Most elementary schools offer limited data science instruction; few elementary schools offer data science curriculum with embedded CT practices integrated across disciplines. This research assists elementary educators in fostering children's data science engagement and agency while developing their ability to reason, visualize and make decisions with data.

AB Interdisciplinary perspective on real-life problems is an important skill for 21st century engineers and should be a part of their education. Project-based learning (PBL) is a well-known pedagogical tool for interdisciplinary education. In order to successfully accomplish interdisciplinary learning, students must have sufficient knowledge in each of the separate disciplines. Use of cross-disciplinary teams, for example, is one way to make sure a project team includes specialists in all required disciplines.
   This, however, is not always the case. In many cases, there are significant knowledge gaps within the project team in one or more of the project domains. Specifically, in our case, fourth-year electrical engineering students are working in pairs on biomedical signal processing projects, which are evidently interdisciplinary in nature. The teams, however, are homogeneous and the students lack the essential medical expertise required to achieve solutions applicable by physicians. Furthermore, students tend to acknowledge this gap only in the advanced phases of the project, and so critical phases, such as goal setting and planning, are performed without the required knowledge.
   In this article, we present (a) data that supports the existence of this knowledge gap and its effect on students; (b) an intervention program that exposes students to both the required domain knowledge and its importance to their work; and (c) initial data that supports the success of this intervention program in bridging these gaps.

AB The development of data science curricula has gained attention in academia and industry. Yet, less is known about the pedagogical practices and tools employed in data science education. Through a systematic literature review, we summarize prior pedagogical practices and tools used in data science initiatives at the higher education level. Following the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, we aim to characterize the technological and pedagogical knowledge quality of reviewed studies, as we find the content presented to be diverse and incomparable. TPACK is a universally established method for teaching considering information and communication technology. Yet it is seldom used for the analysis of data science pedagogy. To make this framework more structured, we list the tools employed in each reviewed study to summarize technological knowledge quality. We further examine whether each study follows the needs of the Cognitive Apprenticeship theory to summarize the pedagogical knowledge quality in each reviewed study. Of the 23 reviewed studies, 14 met the needs of Cognitive Apprenticeship theory and include hands-on experiences, promote students' active learning, seeking guidance from the instructor as a coach, introduce students to the real-world industry demands of data and data scientists, and provide meaningful learning resources and feedback across various stages of their data science initiatives. While each study presents at least one tool to teach data science, we found the assessment of the technological knowledge of data science initiatives to be difficult. This is because the studies fall short of explaining how students come to learn the operation of tools and become proficient in using them throughout a course or program. Our review aims to highlight implications for practices and tools used in data science pedagogy for future research.

AB Given growing interest in K-12 data and data science education, new approaches are needed to help students develop robust understandings of and familiarity with data. The model of the quantified self-in which data about one's own activities are collected and made into objects of study-provides inspiration for one such approach. By drawing on what one already knows about their self and their prior experiences, it may be possible to bootstrap students' abilities to interpret and make sense of data. Taking that possibility seriously, this article describes some of the gains observed in students' statistical reasoning following a quantified self, wearables-based elementary statistics unit and provides a theoretical framework drawing from cognitive psychology, embodiment, and situative perspectives to characterize how prior experience is used as a resource in data sense-making when the data are about students' own physical experiences. This framework centralizes and interrogates the work of "remembering" prior experiences and articulates how remembering is involved in interpreting quantified self data. Specifically, the framework emphasizes that remembering in service of data interpretation is a reconstructive act that draws from both general and specific embodied resources and that the work of reconstructive remembering in the classroom is both individual and multi-participant work. To demonstrate measured learning gains and illustrate the framework, written assessment results and descriptive cases of student and teacher discussions about quantified self data from two sixth-grade classes participating in a classroom design experiment are provided. Both a discussion of and recommendations for ethical considerations related to quantified self data in education are also provided.

AB PurposeArts-integration is a promising approach to building students' abilities to create and critique arguments with data, also known as informal inferential reasoning (IIR). However, differences in disciplinary practices and routines, as well as school organization and culture, can pose barriers to subject integration. The purpose of this study is to describe synergies and tensions between data science and the arts, and how these can create or constrain opportunities for learners to engage in IIR.Design/methodology/approachThe authors co-designed and implemented four arts-integrated data literacy units with 10 teachers of arts and mathematics in middle school classrooms from four different schools in the USA. The data include student-generated artwork and their written rationales, and interviews with teachers and students. Through maximum variation sampling, the authors identified examples from the data to illustrate disciplinary synergies and tensions that appeared to support different IIR processes among students.FindingsAspects of artistic representation, including embodiment, narrative and visual image; and aspects of the culture of arts, including an emphasis on personal experience, the acknowledgement of subjectivity and considerations for the audience's perspective, created synergies and tensions that both offered and hindered opportunities for IIR (i.e. going beyond data, using data as evidence and expressing uncertainty).Originality/valueThis study answers calls for humanistic approaches to data literacy education. It contributes an interdisciplinary perspective on data literacy that complements other context-oriented perspectives on data science. This study also offers recommendations for how designers and educators can capitalize on synergies and mitigate tensions between domains to promote successful IIR in arts-integrated data literacy education.

AB The development of data science curricula has gained attention in academia and industry. Yet, less is known about the pedagogical practices and tools employed in data science education. Through a systematic literature review, we summarize prior pedagogical practices and tools used in data science initiatives at the higher education level. Following the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, we aim to characterize the technological and pedagogical knowledge quality of reviewed studies, as we find the content presented to be diverse and incomparable. TPACK is a universally established method for teaching considering information and communication technology. Yet it is seldom used for the analysis of data science pedagogy. To make this framework more structured, we list the tools employed in each reviewed study to summarize technological knowledge quality. We further examine whether each study follows the needs of the Cognitive Apprenticeship theory to summarize the pedagogical knowledge quality in each reviewed study. Of the 23 reviewed studies, 14 met the needs of Cognitive Apprenticeship theory and include hands-on experiences, promote students' active learning, seeking guidance from the instructor as a coach, introduce students to the real-world industry demands of data and data scientists, and provide meaningful learning resources and feedback across various stages of their data science initiatives. While each study presents at least one tool to teach data science, we found the assessment of the technological knowledge of data science initiatives to be difficult. This is because the studies fall short of explaining how students come to learn the operation of tools and become proficient in using them throughout a course or program. Our review aims to highlight implications for practices and tools used in data science pedagogy for future research.

AB Background: Despite the growing interest in health data science education, it is not embedded in undergraduate medical curricula and little is known about best teaching practices. This paper presents a highly innovative course in a UK university that introduces undergraduate medical students to data science. It also discusses a study on student perspectives on the learning and teaching of health data science.Methods: The pedagogical design elements of the Data Science in Medicine course are discussed, along with its syllabus, assessment methodology and flipped classroom delivery. The course has been offered to approximately 630 students over three years. Student perspectives were investigated through three focus groups with the participation of 19 students across different study years in medicine. An experiment was conducted regarding instructor-led vs. video-based modalities of online programming labs, with the participation of 8 students.Results: The course has led to improved data competency among medical students and to a positive change in their opinions about data science. Motivating the course and showing relevance to clinical practice was one of the biggest challenges. Statistics was perceived by focus group participants as an essential data skill. Including data science in the medical curriculum was perceived as important by Year 1 students, while opinions varied between Year 4/5 participants. Video-based online labs were preferred over instructor-led online labs, and they were found to be more useful and enjoyable, without leading to any significant difference in academic performance. Conclusions: Teaching data science to undergraduate medicine students is highly desirable and feasible. We recommend including statistics in the curriculum and practical skill development through simple and clinicallyrelevant data science tasks, supported through video-based online labs. Further reporting on similar courses is needed, as well as larger-scale studies on student perspectives.

AB The increasing importance of data science has created a pressing need for more trained professionals. Hence, it is necessary to design efficient education techniques to rapidly train the next generation of students. We describe a holistic approach that integrates multiple objectives within a single semester course taught at the first year level. The objectives include basic data processing techniques, statistical analysis, teamwork, and project management. We conducted a project that combined different public datasets related to the cost and quality of education in the US. Students demonstrated a high degree of involvement in this exercise as they were curious to explore data that related to their own college selection process. It is well known that it is difficult to perform a cost-quality analysis in the field of college education.
   We used college ranking data created by the Wall Street Journal, and combined it with data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System database (https://nces.ed.goviipeds/) that provided college costs and graduation data. Students worked in teams to download sections of the data from multiple sources, performed cleaning and verification, and merged the data for analysis. This taught them the values of teamwork, goal-setting, and process measurement for timely project completion.
   We determined that the Pearson correlation between the rank of a college and in-state tuition was -0.65 (p<0.005) for private colleges, and -0.34 (p<0.005) for public colleges. This indicates that higher ranked colleges tend to charge higher tuition. The Pearson correlation between the rank of all colleges and their graduation rates is -0.75 (p<0.005), and between rank and retention rates is -0.71 (p<0.005). Private college tuition is typically $40,000 annually, whereas public colleges cost $20,000. These figures suggest that public colleges provide good value. This has policy implications for government funding of education.

AB Emerging data driven economy including industry, research and business, requires new types of specialists that are capable to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. Data Science is becoming a new recognised field of science that leverages the Data Analytics methods with the power of the Big Data technologies and Cloud Computing that both provide a basis for effective use of the data driven research and economy models. Data Science research and education require a multi-disciplinary approach and data driven/centric paradigm shift. Besides core professional competences and knowledge in Data Science, increasing digitalisation of Science and Industry also requires new type of workplace and professional skills that rise the importance of critical thinking, problem solving and creativity required to work in highly automated and dynamic environment. The education and training of the data related professions must reflect all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science and handling practitioners in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple forms, also providing sufficient lab facilities for practical training. This paper discusses aspects of building customizable and interoperable Data Science curricula for different types of learners and target application domains. The proposed approach is based on using the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) initially developed in the EU funded Project EDISON and currently being maintained by the EDISON Community Initiative.

AB Data Science is an emerging field of science, which requires a multi-disciplinary approach and is based on the Big Data and data intensive technologies that both provide a basis for effective use of the data driven research and economy models. Modern data driven research and industry require new types of specialists that are capable to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. The education and training of Data Scientists currently lacks a commonly accepted, harmonized instructional model that reflects all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science practitioners in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. The educational model and approach should also solve different aspects of the future professionals that includes both theoretical knowledge and practical skills that must be supported by corresponding education infrastructure and educational labs environment. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple form, also providing sufficient data labs facilities for practical training. This paper discussed both aspects: building customizable Data Science curriculum for different types of learners and proposing a hybrid model for virtual labs that can combine local university facility and use cloud based Big Data and Data analytics facilities and services on demand. The proposed approach is based on using the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) developed in the EU funded Project EDISON and CYCLONE cloud automation systems being developed in another EU funded project CYCLONE.

AB Background Health Data Science (HDS) is a novel interdisciplinary field that integrates biological, clinical, and computational sciences with the aim of analysing clinical and biological data through the utilisation of computational methods. Training healthcare specialists who are knowledgeable in both health and data sciences is highly required, important, and challenging. Therefore, it is essential to analyse students' learning experiences through artificial intelligence techniques in order to provide both teachers and learners with insights about effective learning strategies and to improve existing HDS course designs.Methods We applied artificial intelligence methods to uncover learning tactics and strategies employed by students in an HDS massive open online course with over 3,000 students enrolled. We also used statistical tests to explore students' engagement with different resources (such as reading materials and lecture videos) and their level of engagement with various HDS topics.Results We found that students in HDS employed four learning tactics, such as actively connecting new information to their prior knowledge, taking assessments and practising programming to evaluate their understanding, collaborating with their classmates, and repeating information to memorise. Based on the employed tactics, we also found three types of learning strategies, including low engagement (Surface learners), moderate engagement (Strategic learners), and high engagement (Deep learners), which are in line with well-known educational theories. The results indicate that successful students allocate more time to practical topics, such as projects and discussions, make connections among concepts, and employ peer learning.Conclusions We applied artificial intelligence techniques to provide new insights into HDS education. Based on the findings, we provide pedagogical suggestions not only for course designers but also for teachers and learners that have the potential to improve the learning experience of HDS students.

AB Purpose Data science is a relatively new field which has gained considerable attention in recent years. This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective. Design/methodology/approach Analysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective? Findings The highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. Originality/value The field of data science has not been explored using bibliographic analysis of publications from the perspective of the LIS. This paper helps to better understand the field of data science and the perspectives for information professionals.
