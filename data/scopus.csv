At its core is a solid understanding of statistics, which is necessary for conducting a thorough analysis of data and deriving valuable insights. Unfortunately, conventional statistics learning often lacks practice in real-world applications using computer programs, causing a separation between conceptual knowledge of statistics equations and their hands-on skills. Integrating statistics learning into Python programming can convey an effective solution for this problem, where it has become essential in data science implementations, with extensive and versatile libraries. In this paper, we present a self-learning method for fundamental statistics through Python programming for data science studies. Unlike conventional approaches, our method integrates three types of interactive problems—element fill-in-blank problem (EFP), grammar-concept understanding problem (GUP), and value trace problem (VTP)—in the Programming Learning Assistant System (PLAS). This combination allows students to write code, understand concepts, and trace the output value while obtaining instant feedback so that they can improve retention, knowledge, and practical skills in learning statistics using Python programming. For evaluations, we generated 22 instances using source codes for fundamental statistics topics, and assigned them to 40 first-year undergraduate students at UPN Veteran Jawa Timur, Indonesia. Statistics analytical methods were utilized to analyze the student learning performances. The results show that a significant correlation ((Formula presented.)) exists between the students who solved our proposal and those who did not. The results confirm that it can effectively assist students in learning fundamental statistics self-learning using Python programming for data science implementations.","Data Science; Fundamental Statistics; Python Programming; Self-learning Method; Application Programs; Codes (symbols); Computer Systems Programming; Education Computing; Engineering Education; Learning Systems; Python; Statistics; Students; Analysis Of Data; Data Driven Decision; Decisions Makings; Fundamental Statistic; Learning Methods; Python Programming; Science Education; Self-learning; Self-learning Method; Statistics Learning; Data Science","Application programs; Codes (symbols); Computer systems programming; Education computing; Engineering education; Learning systems; Python; Statistics; Students; Analysis of data; Data driven decision; Decisions makings; Fundamental statistic; Learning methods; Python programming; Science education; Self-learning; Self-learning method; Statistics learning; Data Science","","Weihs, Claus, Data Science: the impact of statistics, International Journal of Data Science and Analytics, 6, 3, pp. 189-194, (2018); Int J Comput Appl, (2020); J Oper Syst Dev Trends, (2023); Int J Sci Eng Res, (2019); Yadav, Nikhil, Recommended Practices for Python Pedagogy in Graduate Data Science Courses, Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE, 2019-October, (2019); Acad J Sci Technol Eng Math Educ, (2024); South Asian Research Journal of Engineering and Technology, (2023); Yavuz Temel, Güler, Using Jupyter Notebooks as digital assessment tools: An empirical examination of student teachers’ attitudes and skills towards digital assessment, Education and Information Technologies, (2025); Avila, Cecilia, Curriculum, Pedagogy, and Teaching/Learning Strategies in Data Science Education, Education Sciences, 15, 2, (2025); Tufino, Eugenio, Integrating Python data analysis in an existing introductory laboratory course, European Journal of Physics, 45, 4, (2024)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20782489","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011616203"

Promoting CDL requires collaborative approaches to enhance learners’ skills in data science, going beyond mere quantitative reasoning to encompass a comprehensive understanding of data workflows and tools. Despite the growing literature on CDL, there is still a need to explore how students use data science practices for supporting the learning of CDL throughout a summer-long data science program. Drawing on situative perspectives of learning, we utilize a descriptive case study to address our research question: How do data science practices taught in a classroom setting differ from those enacted in real-world social justice projects? Key findings reveal that while the course focused on abstract principles and basic technical skills, the Food Justice Project provided students with a more applied understanding of data tools, ethics, and exploration. Through the project, students demonstrated a deeper engagement with CDL, addressing real-world issues through detailed data analysis and ethical considerations. This manuscript adds to the literature within data science education and has the potential to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, preparing students to address real-world data science challenges through their coursework.","Critical Data Literacy; Data Science Education; Data Science Practices; Food Justice; Higher Education; Situated Learning; Teaching Data Science; Teaching Statistics; Undergraduate","","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (Award Number SBE 2150505).

However, researchers report struggling to find data science education that meets their needs, despite the fact that many training programs and online resources exist. There is a lack of evidence on the strengths and weaknesses of various training options, making selecting an educational path daunting. We created a new data science training program focused on rigorous, reproducible methods for biomedical research, making use of tightly scoped modular content that can be flexibly arranged to provide a curriculum tailored to a researcher’s specific needs and skill level. Moreover, we ran a study testing the program’s effectiveness, providing not only another option for data science training but also a model for collecting and sharing relevant data on data science education programs. We ran two waves of research participants, adjusting our materials in between to improve both the training program and our research design. For both waves, we pre-registered hypotheses that learners’ self-reported data science ability and level of agreement with important tenets of open science would increase over the course of the program. Indeed, learners showed significant improvement in data science ability (Wave 1: t(47) = 10.18, p<.001, Wave 2: t(238) = 17.12, p<.001) and greater agreement with open science values (Wave 1: t(47) = 3.56, p<.001, Wave 2: t(238) = 7.95, p<.001). Follow up analyses underscore the robustness of improvement in data science ability. The improvement in open science values was more moderate and was significant only in some of our pre-registered hypothesis tests, likely due to a ceiling effect as most learners reported high agreement with open science values at pretest.","Python; R; Big Data; Bioinformatics; Curricula; Data Accuracy; Data Analytics; Data Science; Personnel Training; Statistical Tests; Biomedical Research; Computational Technique; Human Health; Modulars; Online Resources; Open Science; Research Trainings; Science Education; Skill Levels; Training Program; Software Testing; Adoption; Article; Biomedical Learner; Curriculum; Data And Analytics For Research Training; Data Science; Data Science Education; Human; Knowledge; Learning; Machine Learning; Medical Research; Medical Student; Questionnaire; Training; Workshop","Big data; Bioinformatics; Curricula; Data accuracy; Data Analytics; Data Science; Personnel training; Statistical tests; Biomedical research; Computational technique; Human health; Modulars; Online resources; Open science; Research trainings; Science education; Skill levels; Training program; Software testing; adoption; Article; biomedical learner; curriculum; data and analytics for research training; data science; data science education; human; knowledge; learning; machine learning; medical research; medical student; questionnaire; training; workshop","JP received funding for this work from the National Institutes of Health (https:// www.nih.gov/), grant NIH 5R25GM141501.

Specifically, the number and duration of exams (and thereby the amount of content on each) and setting in which the students took the exams in changed among the three years examined. The analysis involved comparing student grades, sentiment analysis of written feedback, and keyword analysis between the Spring semesters of 2021, 2022, and 2023. The results demonstrate significant improvements in overall grades and mean exam grades in 2022 and 2023 compared to 2021, indicating that the shift in offering more frequent and shorter in-class exams covering less material positively impacted student performance. This indication is also supported by the keyword analysis, which revealed a shift in student feedback discussing challenges with formal assessments. Furthermore, sentiment analysis shows less polarization and a significant decrease in negative comments after compared to before the intervention, suggesting improved student perception and experience in the course. By considering both quantitative and qualitative measures, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of how student performance and experiences changed with different exam modalities, guiding future curriculum design and instructional improvements for data science courses for engineers.","Curricular Development; Data Science Education; Exam Modality; Formal Assessments; Python Programming; Student Assessment; Student Feedback; Curricula; Engineering Education; Students; Curricular Development; Data Science Education; Exam Modality; Formal Assessment; Keywords Analysis; Python Programming; Science Education; Sentiment Analysis; Student Assessment; Student Feedback; Data Science","Curricula; Engineering education; Students; Curricular development; Data science education; Exam modality; Formal assessment; Keywords analysis; Python programming; Science education; Sentiment analysis; Student assessment; Student feedback; Data Science","The authors of this paper acknowledge their students for participating in additional surveys throughout the course.

It supports figure organization, AI-assisted insight extraction, and structured narrative generation using seven storytelling patterns. Unlike automated tools, Story Studio emphasizes active learning, helping students craft and refine their own data narratives.

However, the only research to attend carefully to youth’s data-based, artistic storytelling practices has been limited in scope to specific storytelling mechanisms, like youth’s metaphor usage. Engaging in design-based research, we sought to understand the art and design decisions that youth make and the data-based arguments and stories that youth tell through their arts-based data visualizations. We drew upon embodied theory to acknowledge the holistic, synergistic, and situated nature of student learning and making. Corresponding with emerging accounts of youth arts-based data visualization practices, we saw regular evidence of art, storytelling, and personal subjectivities intertwining. Contributing to this literature, we found that these intersections surfaced in a number of domains, including youth’s pictorial symbolism, visual encoding strategies, and data decisions like manifold pictorial symbols arranged to support complex, multilayered, ambiguous narratives; qualitative data melding community and personal lived experience; and singular statements making persuasive appeals. This integration of art, story, agency, and embodiment often manifested in ways that seemed to jostle against traditional notions of and norms surrounding data science.","Art Education; Data Science Education; Data Visualization; Design-based Research; Informal Learning; Mathematics Education","","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2215004.

Justice-centered STEM education engages all students in multiple STEM subjects, including data science and computer science, to explain and design solutions to societal challenges disproportionately impacting minoritized groups. We articulate the affordances of justice-centered STEM education for one minoritized student group that has been traditionally denied meaningful STEM learning: multilingual learners (MLs). Justice-centered STEM education with MLs leverages the assets they bring to STEM learning, including their transnational experiences and knowledge as well as their rich repertoire of meaning-making resources. In this position paper, we propose our conceptual framework to chart a new research agenda on justice-centered STEM education to address societal challenges with all students, especially MLs. Our conceptual framework incorporates four interrelated components by leveraging the convergence of multiple STEM disciplines to promote justice-centered STEM education with MLs: (a) societal challenges in science education, (b) justice-centered data science education, (c) justice-centered computer science education, and (d) justice-centered engineering education. The article illustrates our conceptual framework using the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has presented an unprecedented societal challenge but also an unprecedented opportunity to cultivate MLs' assets toward promoting justice in STEM education. Finally, we describe how our conceptual framework establishes the foundation for a new research agenda that addresses increasingly complex, prevalent, and intractable societal challenges disproportionately impacting minoritized groups. We also consider broader issues pertinent to our conceptual framework, including the social and emotional impacts of societal challenges; the growth of science denial and misinformation; and factors associated with politics, ideology, and religion. Justice-centered STEM education contributes to solving societal challenges that K-12 students currently face while preparing them to shape a more just society.","Covid-19; Justice-centered Stem Education; Multilingual Learners; Societal Challenges; Engineering Education; Affordances; Conceptual Frameworks; Design Solutions; Justice-centered Stem Education; Multilingual Learner; Research Agenda; Science Education; Societal Challenge; Stem Education; Student Groups; Students","Engineering education; Affordances; Conceptual frameworks; Design solutions; Justice-centered STEM education; Multilingual learner; Research agenda; Science education; Societal challenge; STEM education; Student groups; Students","","Allchin, Douglas, Ten competencies for the science misinformation crisis, Science Education, 107, 2, pp. 261-274, (2023); Arnold, Elizabeth G., Using physical simulations to motivate the use of differential equations in models of disease spread, International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology, 55, 2, pp. 326-339, (2024); Bang, Megan, Cultural processes in science education: Supporting the navigation of multiple epistemologies, Science Education, 94, 6, pp. 1008-1026, (2010); Bang, Megan, Participatory Design Research and Educational Justice: Studying Learning and Relations Within Social Change Making, Cognition and Instruction, 34, 3, pp. 173-193, (2016); Bang, Megan, Desettling expectations in science education, Human Development, 55, 5-6, pp. 302-318, (2012); Bang, Megan, Community-Based Design Research: Learning Across Generations and Strategic Transformations of Institutional Relations Toward Axiological Innovations, Mind, Culture, and Activity, 23, 1, pp. 28-41, (2016); Multicultural Education Issues and Perspectives, (1993); Basu, Satabdi, Identifying middle school students’ challenges in computational thinking-based science learning, Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning, 11, 1, (2016); Basu, Satabdi, Learner modeling for adaptive scaffolding in a Computational Thinking-based science learning environment, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 27, 1, pp. 5-53, (2017); Bell, Lee Anne, Theoretical foundations for social justice education, pp. 3-26, (2016)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","00224308; 10982736","","JRSTA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003017489"

As a result, the need to incorporate core data-intensive skills into nearly every discipline has recently gained increased attention. This paper details our experiences developing a framework where CS and non-CS faculties collaborate on developing contextual data science modules tailored to the needs of multiple disciplines, academic levels, and student and instructor preparedness and integrate them into existing undergraduate courses. A quantitative and qualitative analysis approach is used to explore the following research question: To what extent a common framework be utilized to integrate data science-based learning objectives into multiple science, social, and health science courses to generate more data science-informed graduates? A significant number of underrepresented and minority (URM) students were exposed to data science knowledge and skills throughout this intervention during the last three years. The student performance and survey results show that most students understood the concepts and could use related tools to organize and use data to support their claims and conclusions to a certain extent. Further analysis of instructor perspectives identified commonalities, such as the benefits of incorporating data science concepts into disciplinary contexts through hands-on exercises using real-world data, as well as differences, such as student activity types based on instructor and student preparedness and usage and rigor of data science tools.","Broadening Participation; Course Module; Curricula; Data Science; Msi; Urm; Data Mining; Data Science; Engineering Education; Information Retrieval; Information Use; Students; Teaching; Academic Level; Broadening Participation; Course Modules; Data Intensive; Experience Report; Msi; Multiple Disciplines; Science Education; Science Modules; Underrepresented And Minority; Curricula","Data mining; Data Science; Engineering education; Information retrieval; Information use; Students; Teaching; Academic level; Broadening participation; Course modules; Data intensive; Experience report; MSI; Multiple disciplines; Science education; Science modules; Underrepresented and minority; Curricula","We would like to acknowledge NSF award # 2245959 and UNC ROI Award 2020-2023.","Envisioning the Data Science Discipline the Undergraduate Perspective Interim Report, (2018); Data Science for Undergraduates Opportunities and Options, (2018); Keeping Data Science Broad Negotiating the Digital and Data Divide Among Higher Education Institutions; Study of Data Science Lags in Gender and Racial Representation; Inclusion Across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science; NSF Transdisciplinary Research in Principles of Data Science Tripods; Harnessing the Data Revolution Hdr at NSF; undefined; undefined; Riegle-Crumb, Catherine, Does STEM Stand Out?

We operationalize computational thinking as the ways of thinking that individuals employ when using computational tools to solve problems. Focusing on computational thinking in the context of data, we conceptualize three classes of data engagement (exploration, analysis, and communication) and review existing problem-solving phases and actions in the literature. In task-based interviews, we study statistics and data science undergraduate students, graduate students, and a professional data scientist using the R programming language to address a data exploration and analysis task. Using a grounded theory approach, we engaged in constant comparison to characterize segments from our interviews, with models from the literature building our theoretical sensitivity. Our results follow our participants’ data exploration and analysis across the problem-solving phases of orienting, planning, executing, and checking. In addressing our research question, we note the differences in how participants loaded the data, explored the data, and planned for the task at hand as well as the similarities in how participants constructed a derived object. We then propose an initial framework containing problem-solving actions, resources, and methods and heuristics, highlighting the interplay between data exploration and analysis (based on orienting to the data and orienting to the task, respectively) as well as the actions of recasting data and creating derived objects.","Coding; Computational Thinking; Data; Data Science Education; Statistics Education","","","Aho, Alfred V., Computation and computational thinking, Computer Journal, 55, 7, pp. 833-835, (2012); American Statistical Association Undergraduate Guidelines Workgroup, (2014); Carlson, Marilyn P., The cyclic nature of problem solving: An emergent multidimensional problem-solving framework, Educational Studies in Mathematics, 58, 1, pp. 45-75, (2005); Basics of Qualitative Research Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory, (2008); Garfield, Joan B., Developing students’ reasoning about samples and sampling variability as a path to expert statistical thinking, Educational Studies in Mathematics, 88, 3, pp. 327-342, (2015); Handbook of Research Design in Mathematics and Science Education, (2000); Hunting, Robert Paul, Clinical interview methods in mathematics education research and practice, Journal of Mathematical Behavior, 16, 2, pp. 145-165, (1997); Proceedings of the 38th Annual Meeting of the North American Chapter of the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education, (2016); Six Psychological Studies, (1967); How to Solve It, (1957)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","18639704; 18639690","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008064083"

It may be beneficial to introduce machine learning, such as decision trees (DTs), at an early stage of education. The data-based construction of DTs is an example of a machine learning process, which can be addressed in mathematics or statistics teaching because of relatively low prior knowledge requirements. This paper focuses on investigating how sixth-grade students create and evaluate data-based DTs. The basis is a teaching unit that aims to lay the foundation for machine learning and enhance students’ understanding of the process. We investigate students’ processes in detail while they build DTs with data cards about food items to predict whether a new item is recommendable. After the teaching unit, an interview study examines students’ strategies for creating decision trees. The findings contribute to understanding students’ learning processes and the challenges when working with decision trees.","Data Science Education; Decision Trees; Machine Learning; Statistics Education; Unplugged","","The research leading to these results received funding from the Deutsche Telekom Stiftung.

This special issue draws together new research in statistics education through a lens of data and ‘data-ing’. In much the same way as other statistical noun–verb pairings (such as sample–sampling and model–modelling), the terms data and data-ing exemplify both the forms and practices of engaging with contemporary data. Data have taken on unprecedented forms; the majority of which are unstructured, messy, massive, and rapidly or continuously collected. Data are in forms not previously even conceptualised, such as social media posts, satellite imagery, and tele-marketing recordings. To engage with these data requires making sense of, summarising, representing, and drawing conclusions from data, often without clear analytical approaches already developed. Hence, expanded skills for data literacy are needed for those who are not statistically trained to modify, combine, and invent techniques and ways of thinking to work with and make sense of data. There are important implications for education systems to rise to meet the challenges of educating learners to be competent, data literate citizens. This special issue contributes new knowledge from research of how students, teachers and citizens are learning to engage in new forms and practices with contemporary data. In this survey paper, we discuss research that uses these contemporary data and/or the subsequent tasks and pedagogies that have emerged to address these challenges, while questioning what this means for statistics education.","Big Data; Data; Data Literacy; Data Science Education; Data-ing; Multivariate Data; Non-standard Data; Statistics Education","","Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.","Aridor-Berger, Keren, Living the DReaM: The interrelations between statistical, scientific and nature of science uncertainty articulations through citizen science, Instructional Science, 51, 5, pp. 729-762, (2023); T.k, Balaji K., Machine learning algorithms for social media analysis: A survey, Computer Science Review, 40, (2021); Barbosa, Jonei Cerqueira, Mathematical modelling in classroom: A socio-critical and discursive perspective, ZDM - International Journal on Mathematics Education, 38, 3, pp. 293-301, (2006); Pre K 12 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education II Gaise II, (2020); Barwell, Richard, Ambiguity in the mathematics classroom, Language and Education, 19, 2, pp. 117-125, (2005); Beccuti, Francesco, TEACHING MATHEMATICS IN TODAY’S SOCIETY: DIDACTIC PARADIGMS, NARRATIVES AND CITIZENSHIP, For the Learning of Mathematics, 42, 2, pp. 29-34, (2022); Ben-Zvi, Dani, Students’ emergent articulations of uncertainty while making informal statistical inferences, ZDM - International Journal on Mathematics Education, 44, 7, pp. 913-925, (2012); Ben-Zvi, Dani, Learning to reason from samples, Educational Studies in Mathematics, 88, 3, pp. 291-303, (2015); Esm, (2015); Statistics Education Research Journal, (2004)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","18639704; 18639690","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003866681"

This paper presents insights and findings from 15 years of teaching Data Mining and Business Intelligence in a Computer Science Master’s program, where a key component of the course is a semester-long assignment involving publicly available, messy, and often incomplete datasets. These datasets include examples such as publicly accessible datasets on accidents or fines from data.gov.uk, data from data contest platforms like Kaggle, and house rental data from platforms like Airbnb. Through these assignments, students are tasked with not only applying algorithmic tools but also addressing challenges like missing information, noisy inputs, and inconsistencies. They also learn the importance of finding and integrating supplementary open data sources to enhance the value and depth of their analyses. The primary objective of this approach is to enhance students’ problem-solving abilities by engaging them in complex, real-world data scenarios where they must navigate and resolve issues related to data quality and completeness. This approach cultivates critical skills such as data wrangling, preprocessing, and the extraction of meaningful insights, along with the ability to understand and articulate the business value of the data. Working hypotheses, such as the impact of data quality on analysis outcomes, are explored, and the paper demonstrates how addressing these challenges improves students’ decision-making processes in data-driven tasks. By engaging with real-world datasets, students develop resilience, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities, which are essential for navigating the complexities of data science in professional settings. This paper highlights the educational benefits of using messy data to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application while also demonstrating how this method explicitly improves students’ problem-solving and critical thinking skills in the context of data science.","Data Preprocessing; Data Science Education; Data Wrangling; Problem-solving Skills; Real-world Datasets","","","Allen, Genevera I., Experiential Learning in Data Science: Developing an Interdisciplinary, Client-Sponsored Capstone Program, pp. 516-522, (2021); Baumer, Benjamin S., A Data Science Course for Undergraduates: Thinking With Data, American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 334-342, (2015); Clare, John D.J., Making inference with messy (citizen science) data: when are data accurate enough and how can they be improved?, Ecological Applications, 29, 2, (2019); Donoghue, Thomas, Teaching Creative and Practical Data Science at Scale, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 29, S1, pp. S27-S39, (2021); Hicks, Stephanie C., A Guide to Teaching Data Science, American Statistician, 72, 4, pp. 382-391, (2018); Hohman, Fred, Understanding and Visualizing Data Iteration in Machine Learning, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, (2020); Jarrahi, Mohammad Hossein, The Principles of Data-Centric AI, Communications of the ACM, 66, 8, pp. 84-92, (2023); Kjelvik, Melissa K., Getting messy with authentic data: Exploring the potential of using data from scientific research to support student data literacy, CBE Life Sciences Education, 18, 2, (2019); Experiential Learning Experience as the Source of Learning and Development, (2014); Lau, Samuel, How Computer Science and Statistics Instructors Approach Data Science Pedagogy Differently: Three Case Studies, 1, pp. 29-35, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","22277102","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003671390"

Within this landscape, new block-based programming (BBP) environments have been developed to integrate data visualization functionalities. However, the construction of visualizations entails distinct goals and forms of interaction from those typically used in conventional programming, which should be considered in designing those environments. Drawing inspiration from taxonomies within the field of Information Visualization, we derived a framework for the analysis of educational tools in this domain comprising four categories: supported goals, expressiveness, abstraction, and transparency. We situate six existing BBP environments within the design space of the framework and illustrate its application by describing the design of PlayData, a BBP environment developed to address a gap in data visualization tools for young audiences. Our goal is to contribute to a more theoretically grounded discussion on the topic by connecting well-established research on professional tools for data visualization and the design of related educational environments targeted at middle and high school students.","Block-based Programming Environments; Coding; Constructionism; Data Science Education; Information Visualization; User Interfaces; Visualization Construction Tools","","","Constructionism in Practice Designing Thinking and Learning in A Digital World, (1996); Piaget S Constructivism Papert S Constructionism What S the Difference, (2001); Aivaloglou, Efthimia, How kids code and how we know: An exploratory study on the scratch repository, pp. 53-61, (2016); Proceedings of the 17th International Conference of the Learning Sciences Icls 2023, (2023); Data Driven Storytelling, (2018); Börner, Katy, Data visualization literacy: Definitions, conceptual frameworks, exercises, and assessments, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 116, 6, pp. 1857-1864, (2019); Börner, Katy, Investigating aspects of data visualization literacy using 20 information visualizations and 273 science museum visitors, Information Visualization, 15, 3, pp. 198-213, (2016); Challenges and Opportunities in Data Visualization Education A Call to Action, (2023); Bart, Austin Cory, Design and Evaluation of a Block-based Environment with a Data Science Context, IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, 8, 1, pp. 182-192, (2020); Beans, Carolyn, Musicians join scientists to explore data through sound, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 114, 18, pp. 4563-4565, (2017)","","Elsevier B.V.","22128689","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212663722"

However, some studies show that this has not enhanced interest or curiosity in data science. Therefore, gamification appears to be an efficient method for encouraging high school students’ interest in data science, with research indicating that video games are effective in education. Given this, we developed a battle-type game “Data Monsters” to improve junior high school and university students’ interest in data science. The effectiveness of Data Monsters was evaluated using a questionnaire, and data analysis and utilization tests were assessed before and after playing this game. A total of 20 participants, comprising junior high school to university students, who were unfamiliar with data science, joined the experiment. The results of each test demonstrated that the developed game was useful in improving students’ understanding of mathematical terms and their interest in data science. The average score of their interest increased by 1.37 points. In addition, the average score of students’ data analysis and utilization skills improved by 0.96 and 0.71 points, respectively. We believe that creating content that encompasses fields other than data analysis will enable a comprehensive learning of data science.","Battle-type Game; Data Analysis Capability; Data Science; Higher Education; Students; Data Consistency; Analysis Capabilities; Battle-type Game; Data Analyze Capability; Games For Learning; High Educations; High School Students; Junior High Schools; Science Education; Students' Interests; University Students; Data Science","Data consistency; Analysis capabilities; Battle-type game; Data analyze capability; Games for learning; High educations; High school students; Junior high schools; Science education; Students' interests; University students; Data Science","","International Perspectives on Supporting and Engaging Online Learners Innovations in Higher Education Teaching and Learning, (2021); Aoyama, Kazuhiro, Graph interpretation aspects of statistical literacy: A Japanese perspective, Mathematics Education Research Journal, 15, 3, pp. 207-225, (2003); Asahi Shimbun Think Campus, (2023); Curricular Development in Statistics Education, (2005); Introducing the State of Data Literacy Report 2023, (2023); Dehghanzadeh, Hojjat, Using gamification to support learning in K-12 education: A systematic literature review, British Journal of Educational Technology, 55, 1, pp. 34-70, (2024); Can New Data Science Faculties Solve Japans Digital Talent Shortage, (2023); Cortex A Gamified Approach to Data Science Learning, (2019); Eys, Mark Adrian, Item wording and internal consistency of a measure of cohesion: The group environment questionnaire, Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology, 29, 3, pp. 395-402, (2007); Management and Organizational Studies, (2018)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","22111670; 22111662","","ICMLF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001077627"

To support these learners, program visualization tools automatically generate diagrams to show how code transforms data, in contrast to tools based on large language models (LLMs) that primarily focus on textual explanations. Although program visualization tools are popular among instructors, do novices find these tools usable and useful for data science programs that often manipulate datasets with many rows? To address this, we evaluate a popular, publicly available tool that generates diagrams for Python pandas code through a randomized, in-lab usability study with 17 data science novices. Despite minimal instruction on how to use the tool, novices found that program visualizations increased their confidence in comprehending and debugging code. In addition, even though the tool sometimes produced diagrams with many visual elements, participant performance on the study tasks was not negatively impacted. These findings suggest design guidelines for program visualization tools to help manage cognitive load for data science novices. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that investigates how novices use program visualization tools to understand code that manipulates data tables, and suggests a future where novices can use automatically generated diagrams as a complement to LLM tools for effectively understanding unfamiliar programs in data science.","Data Science Education; Novice Programmers; Program Visualization Tools; Data Science; Program Debugging; Codes Transform; Data Science Education; Data Tables; Language Model; Novice Programmer; Program Visualization; Program Visualization Tools; Science Education; Science Projects; Usability Studies; Codes (symbols)","Data Science; Program debugging; Codes transform; Data science education; Data tables; Language model; Novice programmer; Program visualization; Program visualization tools; Science education; Science projects; Usability studies; Codes (symbols)","","Harvard Data Science Review, (2021); Ahoniemi, Tuukka, Visualizations in Preparing for Programming Exercise Sessions, Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, 178, pp. 137-144, (2007); Digestable Condensed Views of Tabular Data, (2022); Bruce-Lockhart, Michael P., Lifting the hood of the computer: program animation with the teaching machine, Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2, pp. 831-835, (2000); Bruce-Lockhart, Michael P., Developing mental models of computer programming interactively via the Web, Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE, pp. S3-H8, (2007); Bruce-Lockhart, Michael P., Program and Algorithm Visualization in Engineering and Physics, Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, 178, pp. 111-119, (2007); Proceedings of the 17th Annual Workshop of the Psychology of Programming Interest Group Ppig 2005, (2005); Basics of Qualitative Research Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory, (1990); Furmanová, Katarína, Taggle: Combining overview and details in tabular data visualizations, Information Visualization, 19, 2, pp. 114-136, (2020); Transforming Source Code Examples into Programming Tutorials, (2011)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","9798400705311; 9798400705328","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000262927"

To understand expert practices, we conducted a think-aloud study where 4 novice and 5 expert data scientists reasoned about an unfamiliar data analysis script with realistic complexity that used the Python pandas library. Surprisingly, familiarity of the pandas package had relatively minor importance for experts. Instead, experts consistently performed three practices that novices did not: experts examined the data in detail rather than fixating on surface-level code features; experts consistently verified their assumptions about how the data was transformed; and experts navigated lengthy program outputs in a goal-directed way.

Along with the development of curricula to teach data science, the number and diversity of tools for introducing data science to learners are also multiplying. The tools used to teach data science play a central role in shaping the learning experience. Therefore, it is important to carefully choose which tools to use to introduce learners to data science. This article presents a systematic analysis of 30 data science tools that are, or designed to be, used in introductory data science education for K-12 students. The identified tools list includes spreadsheets, visual analysis tools, and scripting environments. For each tool, we examine facets of its capabilities, interactions, educational support, and accessibility. For block-based programming tools, we also examine the data science functionalities available in that tool’s blocks. This paper advances our understanding of the current state of introductory data science environments and highlights opportunities for creating new tools to better prepare learners to navigate the data-rich world surrounding them.","Block-based Programming; Data Science; K-12 Education; Students; Analysis Tools; Block Based; Block-based Programming; K-12 Education; Learning Experiences; Science Education; Science Tools; Scripting Environment; Systematic Analysis; Visual Analysis; Data Science; Article; Controlled Study; Data Science; Education; Nonhuman; Pharmacology; Student","Students; Analysis tools; Block based; Block-based programming; K-12 education; Learning experiences; Science education; Science tools; Scripting environment; Systematic analysis; Visual analysis; Data Science; article; controlled study; data science; education; nonhuman; pharmacology; student","This research is supported by the National Science Foundation (award #2141655).

Decision science, grounded in data collection and idea generation, entails utilizing computer-supported technology for scientific decision-making. Various methods, such as brainstorming, have been explored extensively to foster creative thinking for decision-making. Brainstorming, a common ideation technique, typically involves groups of around 10 individuals. However, limitations in computer capacity and network speed often restrict the participation to only two to three people in system-supported ideation methods. Furthermore, there has been a lack of familiarity with screen sharing. Recently, with the widespread use of platforms like Zoom, screen sharing has become more familiar to the general public, enabling even larger groups of up to 10 people to hold virtual meetings regularly. In this study, the KJ method, a form of brainstorming, was applied to multiple groups of individuals (with 10 participants per group located remotely) using information and communication technology combined with GUNGEN-Web II, a distributed and collaborative support system for the KJ method, and Zoom. The study analyzed several metrics, including the number of idea labels, number of results from group organization, number of graphical symbols indicating relationships between results from group organization, number of characters in the sentences, and evaluation of sentences based on synthetic satisfaction using the analytical hierarchy process. The results indicated that sentences resulting from the ideation method received higher ratings when 10 people were involved. This increase in rating can be attributed to the enhanced fluency (i.e., the number of ideas generated) and flexibility (i.e., diverse viewpoints) resulting from the larger group size, leading to more thoughtful evaluations. Additionally, it is hypothesized that as the number of graphical symbols increases, the overall structure and comprehensibility of the diagram improve, allowing for a more holistic understanding of the content. This, in turn, may result in higher synthetic satisfaction levels as the diagram becomes more structured, facilitating the addition of new ideas in concluding sentences.","Distributed And Cooperative Kj Method; Fluency And Flexibility; Graphical Symbol; Ideation Method; Synthetic Satisfaction","","","Decision Science Decision Making Scientifically; Kj Method, (1986); Applied Imagination, (1957); Stefik, Mark J., Beyond the chalkboard: Computer support for collaboration and problem solving in meetings, Communications of the ACM, 30, 1, pp. 32-47, (1987); Scupin, Raymond U., The KJ method: A technique for analyzing data derived from Japanese ethnology, Human Organization, 56, 2, pp. 233-237, (1997); Munemori, Jun, GUNGEN: Groupware for a new idea generation support system, Information and Software Technology, 38, 3 SPEC.

Orchestrating such discussions can be difficult, as this requires teachers to balance a variety of learning goals and student perspectives. This paper examines how teachers interact with data visualization discussion tasks—specifically, those that engage visualizations’ social complexities—as they consider using them in their own classrooms. Drawing from semi-structured clinical interviews with six U.S.-based teachers as they reviewed discussion tasks called Data Story Bytes, we explore: How did these teachers envision using these data visualization discussions in their classrooms? And, What mathematical, contextual, and/or social aspects of visualizations did teachers emphasize when engaging with the discussion task materials? We found that all teachers envisioned using data visualization discussions as lesson openers or routine activities, but they differed in their overall emphasis on the visualizations’ mathematical, contextual, or social aspects. Despite these differences, certain types of discussion prompts were associated with particular response patterns across all teachers, suggesting these task structures can help guide teachers to address a shared set of intended baseline goals for all three of these dimensions. Our findings represent a first step in understanding whether and how socially-oriented data discussion materials may be enacted in classrooms, and what additional design features and supports may be needed to help teachers do so productively.","Data Discussions; Data Literacy; Data Science Education; Data Talks; Data Visualization","","This work is funded by the U.

To equip students for this challenge, data literacy must be strengthened throughout their K-12 education. This scoping review, conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, aims to provide an overview of methods and approaches for enhancing specific sub-skills of data literacy and to identify research gaps. Analysis of 30 relevant papers reveals that, although various definitions and models of data literacy exist, most emphasize data analysis skills. This area is extensively covered in practical approaches, three times more than methods for planning and conducting independent data collection. This disparity highlights an imbalance in data literacy development and underscores the need to address under-represented sub-skills, in particular the actual data collection process. The review suggests a focus on project-based learning with real-world data and current issues as an effective method to balance out this disparity.

Simultaneously, there has been clear guidance written on curriculum development for both data science (De Veaux et al.) and statistics (Carver et al.) programs. While this was occurring, ABET (now simply an acronym, but previously standing for the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology), in coordination with organizations such as the American Statistical Association, developed accreditation criteria for Data Science programs. In this article, we discuss our journey through ABET accreditation and discuss how adopting ABET processes for continuous improvement strengthens a program’s assessment process. We share best practices for working across multiple departments to collect data not only on individual courses, but also on the program as a whole. While the framework presented was initially established to support ABET accreditation, we argue that a properly executed program assessment should occur regardless of whether or not an institution is seeking ABET accreditation for their data science program. Throughout this article, we also discuss the extent to which ABET requirements naturally fit within our program’s existing goals, including an assessment of how ABET requirements align with major ideas in the field of data science education.","Accreditation; Curriculum; Program Evaluation","","This research was supported in part by the US National Science Foundation under grant IUSE: EDU 21-2142705.

Its versatility enables researchers to explore diverse research questions and extract valuable insights from data. Therefore, it is crucial to extend familiarity with classification methods to non-STEM students, who will encounter such problems in their professional careers. To address this need, this article presents a data science course for non-STEM students on classification methods. The course’s difficulty level is influenced by factors such as students’ backgrounds and the prerequisites and requirements set by the offering department. The suggested course framework begins with data preparation and provides students with a comprehensive toolbox comprising methodical techniques and software tools for classification. This course guides students toward discovering new knowledge and insights about classification and interpretation. The teaching approach emphasizes the dynamic process involved in classification, encompassing grasping the analytical task, understanding terms and concepts, visualizing the classification, analyzing data, interpreting results, and drawing conclusions. This course also combines project-based learning, open discussions, and even competitions among class participants. Incorporating practical projects that involve interaction and decision-making within a quantitative course can be highly beneficial.

Prior research has explored innovative ways to introduce data science to young learners, emphasizing not only the development of data skills but also the connection of data science to students’ authentic inquiries and critical actions. Building on this foundation, this study aims to achieve two complementary goals: integrating Knowledge Building, a well-established pedagogical approach, into K-12 data science education, and enhancing students’ epistemic agency through data practices in knowledge building. To achieve these goals, we engaged a class of 6th-grade students in building knowledge about global issues, supporting their exploration of public datasets related to these topics. Following the Knowledge Building framework, students collaborated to construct explanatory theories, analyzing public datasets to inform and refine their theoretical understandings. Findings revealed that, with appropriate pedagogical and technological supports, 6th-grade students were able to engage in a range of data practices when working with public datasets, derive meaningful interpretations of data visualizations, and contribute to theory-building discussions informed by their data investigations. This study highlights the potential of situating data science within students’ interdisciplinary engagement with authentic problems and demonstrates how supporting data practices can enhance their knowledge-building processes.","Codap; Critical Data Literacy; Data Literacy; Data Science Education; Elementary School; Knowledge Building; Knowledge-forum","","","Adisa, Ibrahim Oluwajoba, Engaging elementary students in data science practices, Information and Learning Science, 125, 7-8, pp. 513-544, (2024); Akyea, Thelma G., Anti-Black Racism & Mathematics: Designs for Intentionally Fostering Courageous Conversations in a Knowledge Building Community, Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Conference, CSCL, pp. 329-336, (2023); Angra, Aakanksha, Development of a framework for graph choice and construction, Advances in Physiology Education, 40, 1, pp. 123-128, (2016); Arastoopour Irgens, Golnaz, Data literacies and social justice: Exploring critical data literacies through sociocultural perspectives, Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Conference, CSCL, 1, pp. 406-413, (2020); Aridor-Berger, Keren, Living the DReaM: The interrelations between statistical, scientific and nature of science uncertainty articulations through citizen science, Instructional Science, 51, 5, pp. 729-762, (2023); Atenas, Javiera, Critical literacies for a datafied society: Academic development and curriculum design in higher education, Research in Learning Technology, 28, pp. 1-14, (2020); Peters, Michael A., Encyclopedia of Educational Philosophy and Theory, pp. 1-2412, (2017); International Handbook of Research in Statistics Education, (2018); Braham, Hana Manor, Students' emergent articulations of statistical models and modeling in making informal statistical inferences1, Statistics Education Research Journal, 16, 2, pp. 116-143, (2017); Chan, Carol Kwai Kuen, Knowledge building: Theory, design, and analysis, pp. 295-307, (2018)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","26939169","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010421417"

AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Jupyter AI coding assistant, enable students to tackle advanced tasks and real-world applications. However, they also risk overreliance, which can diminish cognitive and skill development, and complicate assessment design. To address these challenges, the Fundamental, Applied, Conceptual, critical Thinking (FACT) assessment was implemented in an Environmental Data Science course for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students from civil and environmental engineering, and Earth sciences. By balancing traditional and AI-based assessments, the FACT assessment includes: (1) Fundamental skills assessment (F) through assignments without AI assistance to build a strong coding foundation, (2) applied project assessment (A) through AI-assisted assignments and term projects to engage students in authentic tasks, (3) conceptual-understanding assessment (C) through a traditional paper-based exam to independently evaluate comprehension, and (4) critical-thinking assessment (T) through complex multi-step case study using AI, to assess critical problem-solving skills. Analysis of student performance shows that both AI tools and AI guidance improved student performance and allowed them to tackle complex tasks and real-world applications versus AI tools alone without guidance. Survey results show that many students found AI tools beneficial for problem solving, yet some students expressed concerns about overreliance. By integrating assessments with and without AI tools, FACT assessment promotes AI-assisted learning while maintaining rigorous academic assessment to prepare students for their future careers in the AI era.","Artificial Intelligence In Higher Education; Assessment Design; Critical Thinking; Environmental Data Science Education; Generative Ai In Education; Holistic Assessment; Human-ai Co-creation; Traditional Assessment","","The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Specifically, we argue for (1) renewed interest and investment in Tribal data science education; (2) proactive data practices, laws, and policies that support long-term health and well-being; and (3) the federal government honoring its trust responsibility to support Tribal data resources.","American Indian; Data Anonymization; Data Governance; Data Science; Data Sharing; Data Sovereignty; Deidentification; Ethics; Indigenous Peoples; Information Dissemination; Privacy; Public Health Ethics; Public Health Surveillance; Tribal Data; Tribal Public Health; Adolescent; Aged; American Indian; Anonymization; Controlled Study; Data Stewardship; Government; Health Data; Human; Indigenous People; Information Dissemination; Investment; Law; Legal Duty; Privacy; Public Health; Public Health Surveillance; Responsibility; Review; Science Education; Trust; Wellbeing; Ethics; United States; Humans; Indians, North American; Information Dissemination","adolescent; aged; American Indian; anonymization; controlled study; data stewardship; government; health data; human; indigenous people; information dissemination; investment; law; legal duty; privacy; public health; public health surveillance; responsibility; review; science education; trust; wellbeing; ethics; United States; Humans; Indians, North American; Information Dissemination","","Schmit, Cason D., Dying in Darkness: Deviations From Data Sharing Ethics in the US Public Health System and the Data Genocide of American Indian and Alaska Native Communities, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 27, (2025); Carroll, Stephanie Russo, Operationalizing the CARE and FAIR Principles for Indigenous data futures, Scientific Data, 8, 1, (2021); Whalen, D.

In previous research, we introduced the rDSA system (R Data Science Assignments) to support data science students during formative assessments by providing exercises and feedback. As known, formative assessment has evolved from an “interim” evaluation method into a continuous process that enhances student understanding and informs educators to adjust their teaching strategies. It is closely linked to scaffolding, i.e., the method aiming to guide students from their current knowledge to the skills they can develop next. The research reported in this paper builds on previous findings that showed improved learning outcomes and good student engagement. We explored how to enhance student feedback by incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) with traditional AI into the rDSA system. The results show that students extensively used the system, submitting numerous solutions and attempting various exercises, with activity peaking before exams. The system exceeded expectations in providing useful insights and feedback. However, students faced challenges related to focused attention, probably due to the verbosity of feedback. Learning outcomes, on average, improved, with students who solved more exercises using the tool, performing better than the others.","Automated Feedback; Data Science; Generative Ai; Large Language Models; Llms; Artificial Intelligence; Education Computing; Engineering Education; Feedback; Automated Feedback; Formative Assessment; Generative Ai; Language Model; Large Language Model; Learning Outcome; Science Education; Student Feedback; Students","Artificial intelligence; Education computing; Engineering education; Feedback; Automated feedback; Formative assessment; Generative AI; Language model; Large language model; Learning outcome; Science education; Student feedback; Students","","Angelone, Anna Maria, A Report on the Application of Adaptive Testing in a First Year University Course, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1011, pp. 439-449, (2019); Methodologies and Intelligent Systems for Technology Enhanced Learning 11th International Conference Mis4tel, (2021); Azevedo, Roger, Does adaptive scaffolding facilitate students' ability to regulate their learning with hypermedia?, Contemporary Educational Psychology, 29, 3, pp. 344-370, (2004); Bennett, Randy Elliot, Formative assessment: A critical review, Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy and Practice, 18, 1, pp. 5-25, (2011); Bernardi, Angelo, On the design and development of an assessment system with adaptive capabilities, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 804, pp. 190-199, (2019); Black, Paul J., Inside the black box: Raising standards through classroom assessment, Phi Delta Kappan, 92, 1, pp. 81-90, (2010); Brooks, Christopher A., Towards Culturally Relevant Personalization at Scale: Experiments with Data Science Learners, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 31, 3, pp. 516-537, (2021); Buckingham Shum, Simon J., Educational data scientists: A scarce breed, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 278-281, (2013); Burrows, Steven, The eras and trends of automatic short answer grading, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 25, 1, pp. 60-117, (2015); Chang, Daniel H., Educational Design Principles of Using AI Chatbot That Supports Self-Regulated Learning in Education: Goal Setting, Feedback, and Personalization, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 17, (2023)","","Springer","15604306; 15604292","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008245459"

However, a standardized competency framework for data scientists has not yet been established. Moreover, data scientists have shifted from a generalist approach to focusing on specialised roles within the data ecosystem. As a result, data science curricula have become more specialised, often including a comprehensive introductory phase followed by in-depth studies in specific areas. However, many students struggle to combine the diverse competencies and knowledge elements a data science degree teaches. To address this challenge, this research project focuses on developing a data science framework that identifies interdependencies between competencies and knowledge elements, enabling students to choose personalized learning paths based on their individual goals and prior knowledge. This paper introduces a competency network to create personalized learning paths for an introductory data science course. It will be based on professionally logical interdependencies, which will be evaluated and optimised through the analysis of expert interviews. The goal is to positively impact students' self-efficacy, motivation, and learning outcomes by providing a structured and adaptable learning experience.","Competency Framework; Curriculum Development; Data Science Education; Education; Educational Courses; Learning Pathways; Data Science; Education Computing; Employment; Engineering Education; Students; Teaching; Competency Framework; Curriculum Development; Data Science Education; Educational Course; Learning Paths; Learning Pathway; Personalized Learning; Science Course; Science Curriculum; Science Education; Curricula","Data Science; Education computing; Employment; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; Competency framework; Curriculum development; Data science education; Educational course; Learning paths; Learning pathway; Personalized learning; Science course; Science curriculum; Science education; Curricula","","Cognizant, (2017); Demchenko, Yuri S., EDISON data science framework: A foundation for building data science profession for research and industry, Proceedings of the International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science, CloudCom, 0, pp. 620-626, (2016); De Veaux, Richard D., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 15-30, (2017); Data Science Auf Basis Eines Bachelors in Wirtschafts Informatik Oder Mathematik, (2021); Anderson, Paul E., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, pp. 145-150, (2014); Boahin, Peter, Perceived effects of competency-based training on the acquisition of professional skills, International Journal of Educational Development, 36, pp. 81-89, (2014); Statistical Methods for Experimental Research in Education and Psychology, (2019); Seo, Eunjung, Building key competencies into an environmental education curriculum using a modified Delphi approach in South Korea, Environmental Education Research, 26, 6, pp. 890-914, (2020); Leppink, Jimmie, Assessment programs and their components: A network approach, Scientia Medica, 30, 1, (2020); Jonnaert, Philippe, From competence in the curriculum to competence in action, Prospects, 37, 2, pp. 187-203, (2007)","","IEEE Computer Society","21659559; 21659567","9781467386333; 9781479931910; 9781538629574; 9781479919086; 9781467361101; 9798350394023; 9781728184784; 9781509054671; 9781538695067; 9781728109305","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008175323"

Companies in engineering domains are placing a growing emphasis on hiring engineers who can extract insights and create value from the large amounts of data generated, rather than having distinct roles for designers and data scientists working separately. However, the question of who is responsible for teaching these emerging skills remains an outstanding one: Should they be taught in-house by engineering faculty? Should students take generalized courses outside their program, such as those housed in computer science departments? Or should students be responsible for self-teaching outside their formal training? In this commentary, we argue that undergraduate engineering curricula should include contextualized training in programming and data science concepts. We describe our recent efforts to build a “Data Science Corps” in collaboration with dozens of other institutions throughout the United States and provide specific examples of our recent approach to contextualized data science education in two engineering disciplines, materials engineering and architectural engineering. As engineering programs strive to incorporate new curricula, contextualization becomes vital in bridging the gap between abstract data science concepts and their application in specific engineering disciplines. The collaboration between academia and industry will be crucial for developing effective educational programs that equip future engineers with the necessary skills to thrive in a fast-moving, data-driven world. By embracing this collaboration and integrating data science education within engineering disciplines, we can pave the way for a future where engineers are proficient in both domain-specific knowledge and data science competencies, leading to transformative advancements in the field.","Contextualized Learning; Data Science; Engineering Curriculum; Application Programs; Curricula; Data Mining; Data Science; Personnel Training; Registration Of Engineers; Students; Teaching; Contextualized Learning; Data Driven; Engineering Applications; Engineering Curriculum; Engineering Disciplines; Engineering Domains; Engineering Faculty; Large Amounts Of Data; Machine-learning; Science Education; Engineering Education","Application programs; Curricula; Data mining; Data Science; Personnel training; Registration of engineers; Students; Teaching; Contextualized learning; Data driven; Engineering applications; Engineering curriculum; Engineering disciplines; Engineering domains; Engineering faculty; Large amounts of data; Machine-learning; Science education; Engineering education","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant IIS-2123343.

One such form of authentic assessment is a portfolio of learning evidence, and another is the oral interview or oral assessment. However, the portfolio and interview are not only methods of assessment, but also primary drivers of learning and creative thinking. In statistics and data science education, the portfolio of learning evidence and interview assessment have not been implemented widely, although some authors have explored the implications of assessments. This mixed-methods study examines the interplay between the use of portfolios and interview assessments in a mathematical statistics course and Fink’s framework for significant learning.

In data science education, the specter of students’ turning to LLMs raises multiple issues, as writing is a means not just of conveying information but of developing their statistical reasoning. In our study, we engage with questions surrounding LLMs and their pedagogical impact by: (a) quantitatively and qualitatively describing how select LLMs write report introductions and complete data analysis reports; and (b) comparing patterns in texts authored by LLMs to those authored by students and by published researchers. Our results show distinct differences between machine-generated and human-generated writing, as well as between novice and expert writing. Those differences are evident in how writers manage information, modulate confidence, signal importance, and report statistics. The findings can help inform classroom instruction, whether that instruction is aimed at dissuading the use of LLMs or at guiding their use as a productivity tool. It also has implications for students’ development as statistical thinkers and writers.

We conducted a systematic literature review to (a) portray current evidence and knowledge gaps in self-proclaimed undergraduate data science education research and (b) inform policymakers and the data science education community about what educators may encounter when searching for literature using the general keyword “data science education.” While open-access publications that target a broader audience of data science educators and include multiple examples of data science programs and courses are a strength, substantial knowledge gaps remain. The undergraduate data science literature that we identified often lacks empirical data, research questions, and reproducibility. Certain disciplines are less visible. We recommend that we should (a) cherish data science as an interdisciplinary field; (b) adopt a consistent set of keywords/terminology to ensure data science education literature is easily identifiable; (c) prioritize investments in empirical studies.","Data Science Courses; Data Science Curriculum; Data Science Programs; Educational Technology; Open Access","","","Criteria for Accrediting Applied and Natural Science Programs 20242025, (2024); Harvard Data Science Review, (2021); Journal of Humanistic Mathematics, (2022); Allen, Genevera I., Experiential Learning in Data Science: Developing an Interdisciplinary, Client-Sponsored Capstone Program, pp. 516-522, (2021); 2014 Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Statistical Science, (2014); Anslow, Craig, Datathons: An experience report of data hackathons for data science education, pp. 615-620, (2016); Banadaki, Yaser Mohammadi, Enabling Data Science Education in STEM Disciplines through Supervised Undergraduate Research Experiences, ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings, (2022); Baumer, Benjamin S., A Data Science Course for Undergraduates: Thinking With Data, American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 334-342, (2015); Baumer, Benjamin S., Integrating Data Science Ethics Into an Undergraduate Major: A Case Study, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 30, 1, pp. 15-28, (2022); Publishing Issues and their Impact on Reproducibility, (2021)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","26939169","","","","English","Article","aip","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007294073"

University curricula often lack adequate data analysis and programming education, hence the need to develop an accessible training platform. Methods: A free, accelerated R programming course was developed for healthcare trainees with no prior programming experience. The first module was composed of seven video capsules over 10 days to teach foundational R programming for clinical research. A pretest and posttest study assessed participants’ skills pretraining, immediately posttraining, and three months later. Participants (students, researchers, professors) were recruited from Montreal's academic healthcare community. A Real-Time Delphi method guided test development and mixed-effects models compared scores. Results: Of 102 enrolled participants, 100 were analyzed, which were mostly aged 20–30 (72%) and medical students (92%, 69.6%). Of them, 84% successfully completed the course within 10 days (95% CI [77%—91%]). Mean test scores increased from 4.5/10 pretest (95% CI [4.1–4.8]) to 8.4/10 posttraining (95% CI [8.1–8.7]) (p <.001; Cohen's d = 2.5), with scores at three months (6.8/10, 95% CI [6.4–7.2]) remaining significantly higher than baseline (p <.001), despite a slight expected decline. Conclusion: This accelerated R programming course effectively improves data science skills in healthcare trainees with no prior knowledge. It addresses key gaps in formal data science education with the potential to enhance independent research and analysis skills in complement to university curricula.","Data Science; Health Science; Medical Education; Programming; R; Training Program; University Students","","We would like to thank Simon LaRue, Dre Janie Coulombe, Guillaume Dub\u00E9, and Dre Masoumeh Sajedi for their help in developing the content of the capsules and presenting them.

Objective: We describe 2 trainee-led, multi-institutional datathons as an effective means of teaching key data science and machine learning skills to medical trainees. We offer key insights on the practical implementation of such datathons and analyze experiences gained and lessons learned for future datathon initiatives. Methods: We detail 2 recent datathons organized by MDplus, a national trainee-led nonprofit organization. To assess the efficacy of the datathon as an educational experience, an opt-in postdatathon survey was sent to all registered participants. Survey responses were deidentified and anonymized before downstream analysis to assess the quality of datathon experiences and areas for future work. Results: Our digital datathons between 2023 and 2024 were attended by approximately 200 medical trainees across the United States. A diverse array of medical specialty interests was represented among participants, with 43% (21/49) of survey participants expressing an interest in internal medicine, 35% (17/49) in surgery, and 22% (11/49) in radiology. Participant skills in leveraging Python for analyzing medical datasets improved after the datathon, and survey respondents enjoyed participating in the datathon. Conclusions: The datathon proved to be an effective and cost-effective means of providing medical trainees the opportunity to collaborate on data-driven projects in health care. Participants agreed that datathons improved their ability to generate clinically meaningful insights from data. Our results suggest that datathons can serve as valuable and effective educational experiences for medical trainees to become better skilled in leveraging data science and artificial intelligence for patient care.","Artificial Intelligence; Data Science Education; Datathon; Machine Learning; Undergraduate Medical Education","","The authors thank the teams at Hugging Face, Doximity, Merck, Conduce Health, and AvoMD for their generous support and sponsorship of the 2023 and 2024 MDplus datathon events, and the datathon judges (listed in no particular order) Reza Alavi, MD, MHS, MBA; Caroline Berchuck, MD, MPH; Amit Phull, MD; Sid Salvi; Kathryn Teng, MD, MBA, FACP; Andrea Green; David Dupee, MD; Marc Triola, MD; and Jannes Jegminat, PhD for lending their time and expertise in helping run a successful datathon event.

However, there is a lack of instructional models to guide the design of data science programs in K-12 due to its complex and interdisciplinary nature as well as the involvement of diverse communities in its research targeting various audiences. To address this research gap, we proposed an authentic collaborative inquiry model (SPIRE, Stimulate, Practice, Improve and Reflect) that integrates science inquiry procedures (emphasizing students’ hands-on engagement in data science workflow) and the Knowledge Building approach (highlighting students’ continuous and collaborative work on real-world problems and questions). Following the mode, we developed and engaged 67 secondary school students in an out-of-school Data Science program through two cycles. We examined how students’ data science skills, perceived learning and attitudes changed during and after the program. The findings show that the groups of participants could engage in complete data science processes, demonstrating strong skills in identifying variables, aligning data with investigative questions, and interpreting results in their final artifacts. However, they performed relatively poorly in explaining the rationale of the investigation, comprehensive data analysis and considering other factors beyond those included in the investigative questions. Participants perceived learning significantly increased over the inquiry phases, and their perceived data science skills significantly increased after the program. Overall, the results were positive and uncovered skills requiring more support and scaffolding. Future research and practice can further examine how to apply the SPIRE model in K-12 data science education in schools in subjects such as data science, science, and mathematics and study how to enhance the data science skills that students do not perform well.","Collaborative Science Inquiry; Data Science; K-12; Knowledge Building; Out-of-school Program","","This study was supported by the National Institute of Education Start-up grant (# NIE-SUG 4-22 ZGX).","Altman, Douglas G., Statistics notes: The Normal distribution, BMJ, 310, 6975, (1995); Azeroual, Otmane, Data wrangling in database systems: Purging of dirty data, Data, 5, 2, pp. 1-9, (2020); Bell, Thorsten, Collaborative inquiry learning: Models, tools, and challenges, International Journal of Science Education, 32, 3, pp. 349-377, (2010); Choi, Eunhee, Longitudinal relationships between productive activities and functional health in later years: A multivariate latent growth curve modeling approach, International Journal of Aging and Human Development, 83, 4, pp. 418-440, (2016); Dichev, Christo, Towards Data Science Literacy, Procedia Computer Science, 108, pp. 2151-2160, (2017); Previewing the National Landscape of K 12 Data Science Implementation, (2022); Enders, Craig K., Missing Not at Random Models for Latent Growth Curve Analyses, Psychological Methods, 16, 1, pp. 1-16, (2011); Probabilistic Thinking Presenting Plural Perspectives, (2014); English, Lyn D., Modelling with authentic data in sixth grade, ZDM - International Journal on Mathematics Education, 50, 1-2, pp. 103-115, (2017); Technology Innovations in Statistics Education, (2013)","","Springer","13602357","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003188715"

Due to the interdisciplinary nature and broad scope of the field, further research is essential to unravel how K-12 students can effectively interact with data through productive learning experiences. This is particularly true in data visualization activities, in which students must employ a variety of skills to effectively extract and communicate data insights. In this study, we describe key actions involved in creating data visualizations using a block-based programming environment (PlayData). Based on qualitative video analysis, we identified six core data visualization programming moves: program creation, selection of parameters, output inspection, data inspection, program rearrangement, and visual design. Then, using learning analytics techniques and Epistemic Network Analysis, we developed a method for automatically categorizing and characterizing those moves based on fine-grained log data collected from the environment, which allowed the identification of patterns in students’ trajectories. We found that students’ work is distributed across several micro-tasks, each involving distinct types of interaction with the environment and holding a unique value in the process of engaging in programming, data analysis, and visual design. As students progress, there is a transition among these moves, suggesting the need for activities that ensure comprehensive exposure to all of them. Our study presents two main contributions: a novel approach to automatically categorize and describe learning trajectories in open-ended programming tasks and insights into how K-12 students engage with those tasks in a data-related context, laying a foundation for better supporting learning and research in this emergent area.","Clustering; Computational Thinking; Data Science Education; Data Visualization; Epistemic Network Analysis; K-12; Learning Analytics","","This work was partially funded by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) under the grant 441066/2019\u20134.","Ahmed, Mohiuddin, The k-means algorithm: A comprehensive survey and performance evaluation, Electronics (Switzerland), 9, 8, pp. 1-12, (2020); Alper, Basak, Visualization literacy at elementary school, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, 2017-May, pp. 5485-5497, (2017); Amato, Anna, Critical Data Storytelling through Photography, Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Conference, CSCL, pp. 537-544, (2023); Bach, Benjamin, Challenges and Opportunities in Data Visualization Education: A Call to Action, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 30, 1, pp. 649-660, (2024); Proceedings of the Twenty Third Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, (2001); Barany, Amanda, Learning designs that empower: navigating sandbox data science at the intersection of computing, big data and social media, Information and Learning Science, 125, 10, pp. 794-812, (2024); American Statistical Association and National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, (2020); Basu, Satabdi, A principled approach to designing a computational thinking practices assessment for early grades, pp. 912-918, (2020); Berland, Matthew W., Using Learning Analytics to Understand the Learning Pathways of Novice Programmers, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 22, 4, pp. 564-599, (2013); Bevan, Bronwyn, Learning Through STEM-Rich Tinkering: Findings From a Jointly Negotiated Research Project Taken Up in Practice, Science Education, 99, 1, pp. 98-120, (2015)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","10590145; 15731839","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002247063"

The purpose of this case study is to explore how secondary teachers make sense of mappings between data and visualizations, especially depictions of multivariate relationships. The participants were 14 in-service secondary teachers who were video recorded as they worked through three sets of activities. In these activities, participants created a visualization (network graph) from multivariate data, encoded raw data for several attributes from visualizations depicting multivariate relationships, and structured data into a tidy format. With minimal instruction, participants were able to create visualizations when given data representing multivariate relationships. They were also able to structure non-tidy data into a tidy format with some scaffolding and discussion. Notably, creating data tables from visualizations, especially relational tables, seemed more challenging for them. These results provide insight into secondary teachers’ reasoning about connections between multivariate data and visualization.","Data Science Education; Multivariate Thinking; Statistics Education Research; Teacher Training","","","Ball, Deborah Loewenberg, Content knowledge for teaching: What makes it special?, Journal of Teacher Education, 59, 5, pp. 389-407, (2008); Mathematics Teacher Learning and Teaching Pk 12, (2021); Bargagliotti, Anna E., Undergraduate Learning Outcomes for Achieving Data Acumen, Journal of Statistics Education, 28, 2, pp. 197-211, (2020); Braun, Virginia, Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Braun, Virginia, Reflecting on reflexive thematic analysis, Qualitative Research in Sport, Exercise and Health, 11, 4, pp. 589-597, (2019); Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Teaching Statistics, (2002); Cetinkaya-Rundel, Mine, A Fresh Look at Introductory Data Science, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 29, S1, pp. S16-S26, (2021); Cobb, George W., Mathematics, statistics, and teaching, American Mathematical Monthly, 104, 9, pp. 801-823, (1997); AP Statistics Course Overview 2021, (2021); Engebretsen, Martin, From Decoding a Graph to Processing a Multimodal Message Interacting with data visualisation in the news media, Nordicom Review, 41, 1, pp. 33-50, (2020)","","International Association for Statistical Education","15701824","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000265060"

In the workshop, we emphasize the core concepts of machine learning and predictive modeling to increase understanding among clinicians. Objectives Addressing the limited exposure of health care providers to leverage and critique data science methods, this interactive workshop aims to provide clinicians with foundational knowledge in data science, enabling them to contribute effectively to teams focused on improving care quality. Methods The workshop focuses on meaningful topics for clinicians, such as model performance evaluation and introduces machine learning through hands-on exercises using free, interactive python notebooks. Clinical case studies on sepsis recognition and opioid overdose death provide relatable contexts for applying data science concepts. Results Positive feedback from over 300 participants across various settings highlights the workshop's effectiveness in making complex topics accessible to clinicians. Conclusion Our approach prioritizes engaging content delivery and practical application over extensive programming instruction, aligning with adult learning principles. This initiative underscores the importance of equipping clinicians with data science knowledge to navigate today's data-driven health care landscape, offering a template for integrating data science education into health care informatics programs or continuing professional development.","Data Analysis; Decision Support Algorithm; Forecasting; Machine Learning; Professional Training; Data Science; Education; Human; Teaching; Data Science; Education; Humans; Teaching","data science; education; human; teaching; Data Science; Education; Humans; Teaching","We received support for this work from the Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality (AHRQ) and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) under Award Number K12HS026395; and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation through Grant GBMF9048.

For middle and high school students, data science can put formerly decontextualized subjects into real-world scenarios. Many existing curricula, however, lack authenticity and personal relevance for students. A critique of data science courseware cites the lack of ""author proximity,""in which students do not contribute to the data's production or see their personal experiences reflected in the data. This paper introduces a novel data science curriculum to scaffold middle and high school students in undertaking real-world data science practices. Through project-based learning modules, the curriculum engages students in investigating solutions to community-based problems through visualization and analysis of live sensor data and public data sets. Materials include formative assessments to help educators (especially those from non-math and computing backgrounds) measure their students' abilities to identify statistical patterns, critically evaluate data biases, and make predictions. As we pilot and co-design with teachers, we will look closely at whether the curriculum's resources can successfully support non-technical practitioners engaging in an integrated curriculum.","Computational Action; K12 Data Science; Participatory Data Collection; Project-based Learning; Sensors; Computational Action; Data Collection; High School Students; K12 Data Science; Middle School Students; Participatory Data Collection; Professional Practise; Project Based Learning; Real-world; Science Education; Data Science","Computational action; Data collection; High school students; K12 data science; Middle school students; Participatory data collection; Professional practise; Project based learning; Real-world; Science education; Data Science","","Pre K 12 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education II Gaise II, (2020); World Sensor Web Workshop, (2006); Bussani, Andrea, Thermal Tide Detection: A Case Study to Introduce Open Data Analysis in High School, Physics Teacher, 61, 1, pp. 68-70, (2023); Chinn, Clark A., The Role of Anomalous Data in Knowledge Acquisition: A Theoretical Framework and Implications for Science Instruction, Review of Educational Research, 63, 1, pp. 1-49, (1993); Project Based Learning A Literature Review, (2017); Dangol, Aayushi, Constructionist approaches to critical data literacy: A review, pp. 112-123, (2023); Powerful Learning What We Know about Teaching for Understanding, (2008); D'Ignazio, Catherine, Creative data literacy: Bridging the gap between the data-haves and data-have nots, Information Design Journal, 23, 1, pp. 6-18, (2017); Creative Data Literacy A Constructionist Approach to Teaching Information Visualization, (2018); Data Feminism, (2020)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","9798400705984","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215502732"

Training healthcare specialists who are knowledgeable in both health and data sciences is highly required, important, and challenging. Therefore, it is essential to analyse students’ learning experiences through artificial intelligence techniques in order to provide both teachers and learners with insights about effective learning strategies and to improve existing HDS course designs. Methods: We applied artificial intelligence methods to uncover learning tactics and strategies employed by students in an HDS massive open online course with over 3,000 students enrolled. We also used statistical tests to explore students’ engagement with different resources (such as reading materials and lecture videos) and their level of engagement with various HDS topics. Results: We found that students in HDS employed four learning tactics, such as actively connecting new information to their prior knowledge, taking assessments and practising programming to evaluate their understanding, collaborating with their classmates, and repeating information to memorise. Based on the employed tactics, we also found three types of learning strategies, including low engagement (Surface learners), moderate engagement (Strategic learners), and high engagement (Deep learners), which are in line with well-known educational theories. The results indicate that successful students allocate more time to practical topics, such as projects and discussions, make connections among concepts, and employ peer learning. Conclusions: We applied artificial intelligence techniques to provide new insights into HDS education.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors report on an analysis of three student cases from a design study in which middle and high school youth assembled family migration stories using data visualization technologies with socioeconomic and demographic data. The authors used interaction analysis to examine how students responded to misalignments they encountered between their families’ experiences and data trends in their models, drawing on the theoretical construct of epistemic data agency. Findings: This case analysis demonstrates ways in which students enacted epistemic data agency. Instructional support can help students deepen inquiry and avoid certain pitfalls, such as encoding data in unsound or misleading ways to support a particular story, while encouraging students to see themselves as an epistemic authority on par with data. This study opens pathways for future research that considers how data can shape personal narratives and how students can leverage their experiences in the stories they tell with data. Originality/value: The authors introduce the construct of epistemic data agency to describe the conceptual and material practices that reveal and shape students’ relationships to the data. The descriptions of students enacting epistemic data agency in assembling data stories informs the understanding of how to better elevate and recognize students’ efforts in relation to disciplinary norms and support deeper, meaningful student learning with and about data.","Data Literacy; Data Practices; Data Science Education; Data Visualization; Epistemic Agency; Storytelling","","Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant#1341882 and #1949110.","Azevedo, Flávio S., Seeing in the Dark: Embodied Cognition in Amateur Astronomy Practice, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 27, 1, pp. 89-136, (2018); Barab, Sasha Alexander, Design-based research: A methodological toolkit for engineering change, pp. 151-170, (2014); Pre K 12 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education II Gaise II, (2020); Telling about Society, (2007); Berland, Leema Kuhn, Epistemologies in practice: Making scientific practices meaningful for students, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 53, 7, pp. 1082-1112, (2016); Critical Inquiry, (1991); How Charts Lie Getting Smarter about Visual Information, (2019); Constructing Grounded Theory A Practical Guide Through Qualitative Analysis, (2006); Damşa, Crina I., Shared epistemic agency: An empirical study of an emergent construct, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 19, 2, pp. 143-186, (2010); Data Feminism, (2020)","","Emerald Publishing","23985356; 23985348","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204728393"

The purpose of this study is to explore how “sandbox” or open-inquiry data science with social media supports learning. Design/methodology/approach: This paper offers vignettes from an illustrative youth study case that highlights the pedagogical prospects and obstacles tied to designing for open-ended inquiry with computational data science to access or “scrape” Twitter/X. The youth case showcases how social media can be taken up productively and in ways that facilitate epistemological agency, an approach where individuals actively shape understanding and knowledge-creation processes, highlighting the potentially transformative impact this approach might have in empowering learners to engage productively. Findings: The authors identify three key affordances for learning that emerged from the illustrative case: (1) flexible opportunities for content-specific domain mastery, (2) situated inquiry that embodies next-generation science practices and (3) embedded computational skill development. The authors discuss these findings in relation to contemporary education needs to broaden participation in data science and computing. Originality/value: To address challenges in current data science education associated with supporting sustained and productive engagement in computing-based data science, the authors leverage a “sandbox” approach – an original pedagogical framework to support open inquiry with precollege groups. The authors demonstrate how “big data” drawn from social media with high school-aged youth supports learning designs and outcomes by emphasizing learner interests and authentic practice.","Computational Thinking; Computer Science Education; Culturally Responsive Pedagogy; Data Science; Epistemic Agency; Inquiry-based Learning; Social Media","","This work was supported in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation (#2137708 for review).

Research suggests that when arts-based data visualization is integrated into K-12 curric-ula, these approaches can support students’ art learning and creative data litera-cies. Despite the burgeoning interest in literature surrounding the benefits of data visualization for K-12 students, less attention has been directed towards the ways in which teachers can be supported in designing and implementing data-visualization integrated curricula. This visual essay explores a science, technol-ogy, engineering, art and mathematics (STEAM), arts-based data visualization professional development programme that was centred on socially and ecologically engaged storytelling in the Appalachian region of the United States.

However, university courses must bridge the gap between theoretic knowledge of ethics and ethical practice. Towards this, our research aims to understand how we can promote a critical reflective practice through reflection. We, therefore, investigate how data science students start reflecting and what constitutes reflection-triggering contexts in data science education. For this, we introduce a reflective essay assignment and propose a reflection-sensitive inductive content analysis to analyze it. Our findings based on seven student reflective essays suggest that important reflection trigger characteristics in data science ethics education include students' expectations, a new insight, motivators for reflection related to expectations, teaching formats, and emotions. Our reflection-sensitive analysis is suitable for explorative analysis and creates transparency about existing sensitizing concepts.","Content Analysis; Data Science Ethics; Ethics In Education; Reflective Data Science Practice; Sensitizing Concepts; Content Analysis; Data Science Ethic; Ethic In Education; Ethical Practices; Ethics Education; Reflective Data Science Practice; Reflective Practise; Science Education; Sensitizing Concept; University Course; Data Science","Content analysis; Data science ethic; Ethic in education; Ethical practices; Ethics education; Reflective data science practice; Reflective practise; Science education; Sensitizing concept; University course; Data Science","This work is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, grant 16DHBKI025 (\""ENKIS - Establishment of Sustainable Study Programs for Responsible Artificial Intelligence at the Freie Universit t Berlin\"").","Human Centered Data Science an Introduction, (2022); ACM Conference Proceedings Master, (2020); Atkins, Sue, Reflection: a review of the literature, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 18, 8, pp. 1188-1192, (1993); Baumer, Eric P.S., Reflective informatics: Conceptual dimensions for designing technologies of reflection, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, 2015-April, pp. 585-594, (2015); Bentvelzen, Marit, Revisiting Reflection in HCI: Four Design Resources for Technologies that Support Reflection, Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, 6, 1, (2022); Bezuidenhout, Louise M., What does it mean to embed ethics in data science?

However, the current gap in nurses’ data science education and training poses a significant barrier. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the viability of conducting nurse-led, big-data research projects within a custom-designed computational laboratory and examine the support required by a team of researchers with little to no big-data experience. Methods: Four nurse-led research teams developed a research question reliant on existing EHR data. Each team was given its own virtual computational laboratory populated with raw data. A data science education team provided instruction in coding languages—primarily structured query language and R—and data science techniques to organize and analyze the data. Results: Three research teams have completed studies, resulting in one manuscript currently undergoing peer review and two manuscripts in progress. The final team is performing data analysis. Five barriers and five facilitators to big-data projects were identified. Discussion: As the data science learning curve is steep, organizations need to help bridge the gap between what is currently taught in doctoral nursing programs and what is required of clinical nurse researchers to successfully engage in big-data methods. In addition, clinical nurse researchers require protected research time and a data science infrastructure that supports novice efforts with education, mentorship, and computational laboratory resources.","Big Data; Data Science/education; Nursing Research; Adult; Article; Big Data; Data Analysis; Data Science; Electronic Health Record; Human; Infrastructure; Learning Curve; Mentor; Nurse; Nurse Researcher; Nursing Research; Peer Review; Science Education; Personnel; Procedures; Big Data; Data Science; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Nursing Research; Research Personnel","adult; article; big data; data analysis; data science; electronic health record; human; infrastructure; learning curve; mentor; nurse; nurse researcher; nursing research; peer review; science education; personnel; procedures; Big Data; Data Science; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Nursing Research; Research Personnel","","Essentials Core Competencies for Professional Nursing Education, (2021); Research Focused Doctoral Program in Nursing Pathways to Excellence, (2022); Arcus at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia; Brennan, Patricia Flatley, Nursing Needs Big Data and Big Data Needs Nursing, Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 47, 5, pp. 477-484, (2015); Caruso, Rosario, The Byzantine Role of Big Data Application in Nursing Science: A Systematic Review, CIN - Computers Informatics Nursing, 39, 4, pp. 178-186, (2021); Nursing Outlook, (2014); European Data Governance Act, (2022); Foster, Marva V., Data Science and Graduate Nursing Education: A Critical Literature Review, Clinical Nurse Specialist, 34, 3, pp. 124-131, (2020); Health Data Management, (2019); Kluyver, Thomas A., Jupyter Notebooks—a publishing format for reproducible computational workflows, pp. 87-90, (2016)","","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","15389847; 00296562","","NURVA","38773838","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202217407"

While there is widespread agreement on the importance of teaching ethics within computing contexts, there is no clear method for its implementation and assessment. Studies focusing on methods for integrating ethics into data science courses reveal that students tend to neglect ethical concerns in their data analysis. Based on the data we collected from questionnaires distributed to undergraduate science and engineering students, this paper expands the discussion beyond human concerns and ethics in data science education. As we will show, students tend to neglect the context when attempting to solve data science questions. We argue that gaps in understanding the context relating to the data result in gaps in the analysis as well as in the interpretation of the data. Thus, we propose anthropological thinking as a pedagogy to overcome the context neglect. Placing the spotlight on the context promotes a holistic understanding of the phenomenon being analyzed, as it includes important considerations that do not necessarily fit the more commonly used term human concerns.","Anthropology; Application Domain; Context; Data Science Education; Data Thinking","","","Code 2018 ACM Ethics, (2018); Visual Methods in Social Research, (2001); Bowman, Glenn, Identifying versus identifying with ‘the Other’: Reflections on the siting of the subject in anthropological discourse, pp. 34-50, (2003); Brown, Noelle, The Shortest Path to Ethics in AI: An Integrated Assignment Where Human Concerns Guide Technical Decisions, 1, pp. 344-355, (2022); Bubandt, Nils, Anthropology and the Predicaments of Holism, pp. 1-15, (2011); Cambridge Dictionary, (2021); Gvu Technical Report, (1999); Dilley, Roy M., The problem of context in social and cultural anthropology, Language and Communication, 22, 4, pp. 437-456, (2002); Eriksen, Thomas Hylland, Anthropology, History of, pp. 765-771, (2015); Pluralism and Economics Education, (2010)","","Springer","13602357","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181488422"

As educational environments increasingly adopt data science curricula for K-12 students, the need for scalable, personalized teaching tools becomes critical. While the integration of large language models (LLMs) in educational environments offers significant potential for scalability and automation, it is important to note that the generated language output may not always be highly suitable for K-12 students. In this paper, we introduce the DSRAG, a novel educational automatic feedback generation framework that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and cloud-based LLMs to provide automated and personalized feedback for K-12 students engaged in data science education. DSRAG employs Langchain question-answering and RAG systems to manage educational content and generate feedback on the top of GPT-4. We also demonstrate the framework's capability to simplify complex concepts and align its responses to be pedagogically appropriate and understandable for K-12 students.","Large Language Models; Learning Technologies; Prompt Engineering; Retrieval-augmented Generation; Computational Linguistics; Data Science; Education Computing; Engineering Education; Learning Systems; Automatic Feedback; Cloud-based; Educational Environment; Language Model; Large Language Model; Learning Technology; Prompt Engineering; Retrieval-augmented Generation; Science Education; University Levels; Students","Computational linguistics; Data Science; Education computing; Engineering education; Learning systems; Automatic feedback; Cloud-based; Educational environment; Language model; Large language model; Learning technology; Prompt engineering; Retrieval-augmented generation; Science education; University levels; Students","This work is supported by the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund (RG91/22 and NTU startup) with computation partially performed on resources of the National Supercomputing Centre, Singapore (Project 12003619).","Gpt 4 Technical Report, (2023); Cavalcanti, Anderson Pinheiro, Automatic feedback in online learning environments: A systematic literature review, Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 2, (2021); undefined, (2022); Chroma the Open Source Embedding Database, (2023); Cowan, Brendan, Enhancing Programming Learning with LLMs: Prompt Engineering and Flipped Interaction, pp. 10-16, (2023); Retrieval Augmented Generation for Large Language Models A Survey, (2023); Gkatzia, Dimitra, Generating student feedback from time-series data using reinforcement learning, pp. 115-124, (2013); Kung, Tiffany H., Performance of ChatGPT on USMLE: Potential for AI-assisted medical education using large language models, PLOS Digital Health, 2, 2 February, (2023); Ng, Tsz Kit Davy, Empowering student self-regulated learning and science education through ChatGPT: A pioneering pilot study, British Journal of Educational Technology, 55, 4, pp. 1328-1353, (2024); Check Your Facts and Try Again Improving Large Language Models with External Knowledge and Automated Feedback, (2023)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","9798400706332","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199910179"

Utilizing content analysis, bibliometric, and text-mining methodologies, this study quantifies key metrics found within syllabi, including instructional materials, assessment techniques, learning objectives, and covered topics. The study highlights infrequent textbook sharing, with particular focus on Python programming. Assessment methods primarily involve participation, assignments, and projects. Analysis of Bloom’s Taxonomy suggests a focus on moderate complexity learning objectives. The topics covered prioritize big data competency, analytical techniques, programming competency, and teaching strategies in descending order. This study makes a valuable contribution to the current knowledge by tackling the challenge of delineating the specific content of data science. It also provides valuable references for potentially streamlining the integration of multiple disciplines within introductory courses while ensuring flexibility for students with varying programming and statistical proficiencies in the realm of data science education.","Bibliometric; Curriculum Analysis; Data Science Literacy; Text Mining","","This research was funded by the Ministry of Education of Taiwan (grant number PBM1123243).","Jiang, Haoqiang, Data Science Skills and Graduate Certificates: A Quantitative Text Analysis, Journal of Computer Information Systems, 62, 3, pp. 463-479, (2022); Oliver, Jeffrey C., Undergraduate data science degrees emphasize computer science and statistics but fall short in ethics training and domain-specific context, PeerJ Computer Science, 7, pp. 1-15, (2021); Dichev, Christo, Towards Data Science Literacy, Procedia Computer Science, 108, pp. 2151-2160, (2017); Urs, Shalini R., Evolution of data science and its education in iSchools: An impressionistic study using curriculum analysis, Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 74, 6, pp. 606-622, (2023); Aasheim, Cheryl L., Data analytics vs. data science: A study of similarities and differences in undergraduate programs based on course descriptions, Journal of Information Systems Education, 26, 2, pp. 103-115, (2015); Anderson, Paul E., Data science as an undergraduate degree, pp. 705-706, (2014); De Veaux, Richard D., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 15-30, (2017); Data Science for Undergraduates Opportunities and Options, (2018); Donoho, David L., 50 Years of Data Science, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 26, 4, pp. 745-766, (2017); Demchenko, Yuri S., EDISON data science framework (EDSF): Addressing demand for data science and analytics competences for the data driven digital economy, IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON, 2021-April, pp. 1682-1687, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","22277102","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199418523"

The need for developing data science degree programs and education has been well-established and, in our state, a blue-ribbon panel with industry, academic, and government representatives defined the needs of the state. Additionally, a well-established “think and do tank” published several reports on the importance of data science education and graduates. As we began to develop our programs separately, it occurred to us that we were in a small enough state that, if we chose to do so, we could work together for consistent degree programs. Because we were a small state, we needed to work together to develop quality data science education at all levels. In late 2019, we co-hosted a workshop with representatives from industry, academia, state government, and students at all levels, to explore the potential for developing a state-wide data science educational ecosystem. The response was overwhelmingly “yes.” As a result, and with the collaboration of our state's division of higher education, we developed a vision, strategy, and plan to do so with an “opt-in” approach and this paper presents the vision, strategy, plans, results, and experiences and continuous improvement over more than four years of collaboration.

Effective assessment is crucial for educators to tailor teaching strategies and support student confidence in data science skills. We address this gap by developing a data science self-efficacy survey aimed to empower educators by identifying areas where students lack confidence, enabling the design of targeted plans to bolster data science education. Collaboration among experts from the fields of computer science, business, and statistics was instrumental in crafting a comprehensive survey that caters to the interdisciplinary nature of data science education. The survey evaluates 13 essential skills and knowledge areas, synthesized from literature reviews and industry demands, to provide a holistic assessment framework for educators in the field. Rigorous reliability and validity tests were conducted to ensure the survey's robustness and efficacy in accurately assessing student proficiency.","Data Reliability; Assessment Methodologies; Education Research; Knowledge Areas; Learning Experiences; Literature Reviews; Science Education; Self Efficacy; Synthesised; Teaching Strategy; Uncertainty; Data Science","Data reliability; Assessment methodologies; Education research; Knowledge areas; Learning experiences; Literature reviews; Science education; Self efficacy; Synthesised; Teaching strategy; Uncertainty; Data Science","The National Science Foundation (NSF) provided funding for this work under Grant No. DRL GEGI008182.

The curriculum uses authentic and meaningful data exploration activities to situate data science in students' lived experiences. The curriculum aims to lay the computational foundation of data science and equip students with the necessary skills and practices to become informed and active citizens in our data-driven world. The pilot study, conducted in two sections of a computer science class, demonstrates the curriculum's inquiry-based approach, which allows students to formulate questions based on their interests and answer them by manipulating publicly available datasets. The study illustrates how a block-based learning environment and API data retrieval can be harnessed to support data science learning activities that situate the topics in learners' lived experiences and create an engaging learning experience. The study advances our understanding of ways to use novel technologies to introduce learners to data science, emphasizing the practical implications of using authentic data and the inquiry-based approach in curriculum design.","Data Science Education; High School Students; Interest-driven Curriculum; Computer Aided Instruction; Data Science; Students; Data Driven; Data Exploration; Data Science Education; High School Students; Inquiry-based; Interest-driven Curriculum; Pilot Studies; Science Curriculum; Science Education; Two Section; Curricula","Computer aided instruction; Data Science; Students; Data driven; Data exploration; Data science education; High school students; Inquiry-based; Interest-driven curriculum; Pilot studies; Science curriculum; Science education; Two section; Curricula","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (Award # 2141655).

Given that educational designers often privilege authenticity, the purpose of this study is to examine how teachers use features of data sets to determine their suitability for authentic data science learning experiences with their students. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews with 12 practicing high school mathematics and statistics teachers were conducted and video-recorded. Teachers were given two different data sets about the same context and asked to explain which one would be better suited for an authentic data science experience. Following knowledge analysis methods, the teachers’ responses were coded and iteratively reviewed to find themes that appeared across multiple teachers related to their aesthetic judgments. Findings: Three aspects of authenticity for data sets for this task were identified. These include thinking of authentic data sets as being “messy,” as requiring more work for the student or analyst to pore through than other data sets and as involving computation. Originality/value: Analysis of teachers’ aesthetics of data sets is a new direction for work on data literacy and data science education. The findings invite the field to think critically about how to help teachers develop new aesthetics and to provide data sets in curriculum materials that are suited for classroom use.","Aesthetics; Data Literacy; Data Science Education; Data Sets; Knowledge Analysis; Teacher Thinking","","The authors are grateful for the participation of the 12 teachers who dedicated their time to their study.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper describes a pedagogical approach that uses a data science framework the research team developed to assist teachers in providing data science instruction to elementary-aged students. Using phenomenological case study methodology, the authors use classroom observations, student focus groups, video recordings and artifacts to detail ways learners engage in data science practices and understand how they perceive their engagement during activities and learning. Findings: Findings suggest student engagement in data science is enhanced when data problems are contextualized and connected to students’ lived experiences; data analysis and data-based decision-making is practiced in multiple ways; and students are given choices to communicate patterns, interpret graphs and tell data stories. The authors note challenges students experienced with data practices including conflict between inconsistencies in data patterns and lived experiences and focusing on data visualization appearances versus relationships between variables. Originality/value: Data science instruction in elementary schools is an understudied, emerging and important area of data science education. Most elementary schools offer limited data science instruction; few elementary schools offer data science curriculum with embedded CT practices integrated across disciplines. This research assists elementary educators in fostering children's data science engagement and agency while developing their ability to reason, visualize and make decisions with data.","Connected Learning; Data Analysis; Data Science Practices; Elementary-school Children; Qualitative Research; Student Engagement","","This research is supported by NSF Award 2031175: Inclusive Data Science Education for Rural Elementary Students: A Research Practice Partnership for Agile Learning.","K 12 Engineering Guidelines for all Americans, (2008); Arastoopour Irgens, Golnaz, Bop or Flop?: Integrating Music and Data Science in an Elementary Classroom, Journal of Experimental Education, 92, 2, pp. 262-286, (2024); Mathematics Teacher Learning and Teaching Pk 12, (2021); Qualitative Research for Education an Introduction to Theory and Methods, (1998); Why is It Important for K 12 Students to Understand Data and Statistics Understanding how Data is Used how Its Collected and Why Its Collected Helps You Understand that You can Be Empowered by It or You can Be Manipulated by It Says Professor Hollylynne Lee College of Education News, (2021); Troops Trolls and Troublemakers A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation, (2017); Science Teacher, (2011); Student Engagement as A Mediator to Increase Interest in Stem Areas, (2021); Cascio, M.

Sustainable datasets should be reusable, adaptable, and accessible to support long-term AI and data science education goals. However, research on the systematic categorization of difficulty levels in educational datasets is limited. This study aims to address this gap by developing a framework for sustainable educational dataset standards based on learners’ developmental stages and data preprocessing requirements. The proposed framework consists of five levels: Level 1 (grades 1–4), where data preprocessing is unnecessary; Level 2 (grades 5–6), involving basic data cleaning; Level 3 (grades 7–9), requiring attribute manipulation; Level 4 (grades 10–12), involving feature merging and advanced preprocessing; and Level 5 (teachers/adults), requiring the entire data science process. An expert validity survey was conducted with 22 elementary and secondary school teachers holding advanced degrees in AI education. The results showed high validity for Levels 1–4 but relatively lower validity for Level 5, suggesting the need for separate training and resources for teachers. Based on the CVR results and expert feedback, the standards for Educational Datasets were revised, particularly for Stage 5, which targets teachers and adult learners. The findings highlight the importance of expert validation, step-by-step experiences, and an interdisciplinary approach in developing educational datasets. This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of educational datasets and provides practical implications for teachers, students, educational institutions, and policymakers in implementing effective and sustainable AI and data science education in K-12 settings, ultimately fostering a more sustainable future.","Ai Education; Artificial Intelligence; Data Science; Data Science Education; Educational Datasets; Expert Validity; K-12 Education; Sustainable Education; Artificial Intelligence; Data Processing; Data Set; Education; Educational Development; Expert System; Interdisciplinary Approach; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Theoretical Study; Training","artificial intelligence; data processing; data set; education; educational development; expert system; interdisciplinary approach; sustainability; sustainable development; theoretical study; training","","Paek, Seungsu, Analysis of worldwide research trends on the impact of artificial intelligence in education, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 14, (2021); Planning Education in the AI Era Lead the Leap 1618 May 2019, (2019); Taghikhah, Firouzeh Rosa, Artificial intelligence and sustainability: Solutions to social and environmental challenges, pp. 93-108, (2022); Touretzky, David S., Special session: AI for K-12 guidelines initiative, pp. 492-493, (2019); Wu, Fei, Towards a new generation of artificial intelligence in China, Nature Machine Intelligence, 2, 6, pp. 312-316, (2020); Machine Learning for Kids, (2021); A Better Future Education for all 2022 Revised Curriculum Overview Main Points, (2021); Rosenberg, Joshua M., Big data, big changes?

Yet, less is known about the pedagogical practices and tools employed in data science education. Through a systematic literature review, we summarize prior pedagogical practices and tools used in data science initiatives at the higher education level. Following the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, we aim to characterize the technological and pedagogical knowledge quality of reviewed studies, as we find the content presented to be diverse and incomparable. TPACK is a universally established method for teaching considering information and communication technology. Yet it is seldom used for the analysis of data science pedagogy. To make this framework more structured, we list the tools employed in each reviewed study to summarize technological knowledge quality. We further examine whether each study follows the needs of the Cognitive Apprenticeship theory to summarize the pedagogical knowledge quality in each reviewed study. Of the 23 reviewed studies, 14 met the needs of Cognitive Apprenticeship theory and include hands-on experiences, promote students’ active learning, seeking guidance from the instructor as a coach, introduce students to the real-world industry demands of data and data scientists, and provide meaningful learning resources and feedback across various stages of their data science initiatives. While each study presents at least one tool to teach data science, we found the assessment of the technological knowledge of data science initiatives to be difficult. This is because the studies fall short of explaining how students come to learn the operation of tools and become proficient in using them throughout a course or program. Our review aims to highlight implications for practices and tools used in data science pedagogy for future research.","Artificial Intelligence; Data Analytics; Education; Higher Education","","This study was funded by Canada Research Chair Program and Canada Foundation for Innovation","Akram, Huma, Technology Integration in Higher Education During COVID-19: An Assessment of Online Teaching Competencies Through Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge Model, Frontiers in Psychology, 12, (2021); Aktaş, İdris, Investigating the impact of TPACK development course on pre-service science teachers’ performances, Asia Pacific Education Review, 21, 4, pp. 667-682, (2020); Rmarkdown Dynamic Documents for R, (2016); Allen, Genevera I., Experiential Learning in Data Science: Developing an Interdisciplinary, Client-Sponsored Capstone Program, pp. 516-522, (2021); Anderson, Paul E., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, pp. 145-150, (2014); Archambault, Leanna, Revisiting technological pedagogical content knowledge: Exploring the TPACK framework, Computers and Education, 55, 4, pp. 1656-1662, (2010); Barman, Arko, Experiential Learning in Data Science Through a Novel Client-Facing Consulting Course, Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE, 2022-October, (2022); Bart, Austin Cory, Reconciling the promise and pragmatics of enhancing computing pedagogy with data science, 2018-January, pp. 1029-1034, (2018); Berman, Francine, Realizing the potential of data science, Communications of the ACM, 61, 4, pp. 67-72, (2018); Bonnell, Jerry, Challenges and Issues in Data Science Education, Computer, 55, 2, pp. 63-66, (2022)","","Springer","13602357","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168684070"

However, differences in disciplinary practices and routines, as well as school organization and culture, can pose barriers to subject integration. The purpose of this study is to describe synergies and tensions between data science and the arts, and how these can create or constrain opportunities for learners to engage in IIR. Design/methodology/approach: The authors co-designed and implemented four arts-integrated data literacy units with 10 teachers of arts and mathematics in middle school classrooms from four different schools in the USA. The data include student-generated artwork and their written rationales, and interviews with teachers and students. Through maximum variation sampling, the authors identified examples from the data to illustrate disciplinary synergies and tensions that appeared to support different IIR processes among students. Findings: Aspects of artistic representation, including embodiment, narrative and visual image; and aspects of the culture of arts, including an emphasis on personal experience, the acknowledgement of subjectivity and considerations for the audience’s perspective, created synergies and tensions that both offered and hindered opportunities for IIR (i.e. going beyond data, using data as evidence and expressing uncertainty). Originality/value: This study answers calls for humanistic approaches to data literacy education. It contributes an interdisciplinary perspective on data literacy that complements other context-oriented perspectives on data science. This study also offers recommendations for how designers and educators can capitalize on synergies and mitigate tensions between domains to promote successful IIR in arts-integrated data literacy education.","Arts-integration; Classrooms; Co-design; Data Literacy; Data Science Education; Informal Inferential Reasoning; Interdisciplinary Learning; Middle School; Steam","","This research was supported by a collaborative DR K-12 grant from the National Science Foundation, Award Numbers: 1908557, 1908030 and 1908142.","Aslan, Clare Ellsworth, Cultivating creativity in conservation science, Conservation Biology, 28, 2, pp. 345-353, (2014); Data Driven Storytelling, (2018); What is Hidden Beyond the Data Helping Young Students to Reason and Argue about Some Wider Universe, (2007); Ben-Zvi, Dani, Learning to reason from samples, Educational Studies in Mathematics, 88, 3, pp. 291-303, (2015); Converting Stem into Steam Programs Methods and Examples from and for Education, (2019); Beyond Data Literacy Reinventing Community Engagement and Empowerment in the Age of Data, (2015); Blumenfeld-Jones, Donald S., The Artistic Process and Arts-Based Research: A Phenomenological Account of the Practice, Qualitative Inquiry, 22, 5, pp. 322-333, (2016); Methodological Approaches to Stem Education Research, (2021); Creative Education, (2017); Damşa, Crina I., An ecological perspective on learner-constructed learning spaces, British Journal of Educational Technology, 50, 5, pp. 2075-2089, (2019)","","Emerald Publishing","23985356; 23985348","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179996002"

Though not as widely studied, teaching assignments, where students demonstrate competency through teaching others can be used as a formative assessment tool. This paper describes an ""alternative midterm""experiment conducted in an undergraduate introductory data science class. In this pilot, students were asked to demonstrate their newly learned data science skills by teaching them to individuals without data science backgrounds. The evidence of learning will be illustrated through an in-depth analysis of the students' teaching products. These products consist of two parts: (1) ""Teaching Preparation""materials, such as Python Notebooks containing problems and solutions crafted by the students, and (2) ""Teaching Implementation"", video recordings of real-time interactions between the students and their ""tutees.""The paper will also present qualitative feedback from the students, highlighting promising signs of engagement and acceptance. We will conclude by discussing the challenges and opportunities of implementing this assessment strategy on a larger scale.","Data Science Education; Learning-by-teaching; Data Science; Learning Systems; Students; Video Recording; Active Learning Methods; Alternative Assessment; Assessment Strategies; Data Science Education; Engaging Students; Learning By Teaching; Metacognitive Process; Science Course; Science Education; Self Efficacy; Teaching","Data Science; Learning systems; Students; Video recording; Active learning methods; Alternative assessment; Assessment strategies; Data science education; Engaging students; Learning by teaching; Metacognitive process; Science course; Science education; Self efficacy; Teaching","","Duran Gisbert, David, Learning-by-teaching.

Foundational data literacy skills currently live in a number of subjects across K-12 (e.g., data collection and analysis in science classes, statistical calculations in mathematics/statistics, data visualization and communication in civics/social studies), however, a growing number of schools and districts are introducing stand-alone data science (DS) courses. Given the centrality of computing and programming in the contemporary practice of DS, many of these courses include topics historically reserved for computer science (CS) classes. Further, many CS courses include dedicated time for DS topics (e.g., AP Computer Science Principles' unit on Data). In many ways, DS educators and CS educators are working towards the same ends in complementary ways. However, at other times, the two disciplines are in tension, especially given the scarcity of time in K-12 student schedules for non-core subjects. This panel will explore what DS education and CS education can learn from each other, how each can contribute and advance the goals of the other, and how these two intertwined disciplines can productively live alongside each other in K-12 settings.","Computer Science Education; Data Science Education; K-12; Computer Programming; Data Science; Education Computing; Engineering Education; Students; Computer Science Education; Data Collection; Data Driven; Data Science Education; K-12; K-12 Education; Learn+; Mathematic Statistics; Science Education; Statistical Calculations; Data Visualization","Computer programming; Data Science; Education computing; Engineering education; Students; Computer Science Education; Data collection; Data driven; Data science education; K-12; K-12 education; Learn+; Mathematic statistics; Science education; Statistical calculations; Data visualization","","undefined; undefined; LaMar, Tanya, The importance and emergence of K-12 data science, Phi Delta Kappan, 103, 1, pp. 49-53, (2021); undefined","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","9798400704246; 9798400704239","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189136990"

In introductory data science courses, however, students have found these transformations particularly challenging to learn. One complex transformation is the pivot transformation, which reorganizes a table based on aggregation and summarizing along selected columns and rows. Current assessments test student understanding in static scenarios. Thus, there is an opportunity to help students explicitly work through the steps and variables needed to express a pivot transformation in a randomizable manner. As such, we explore whether a dynamic digital assessment for the pivot transformation can effectively achieve mastery learning towards this skill. Our design is inspired by Parsons problems, in which answer components (pivot table output labels and values) can be composed into the output of a pivot transformation. A question can be derived from a small randomized dataset, and randomized Pandas code that operates upon the dataset and can be autograded. We plan to conduct a pilot study with data science students to investigate whether 1) using a programmable online platform to practice pivot tables helps improve performance on exams, and 2) randomization and instant feedback on the online platform contribute to improved student learning.","Data Science Education; Educational Tools; Mastery Learning; Data Science; Education Computing; 'current; Complex Transformations; Data Science Education; Educational Tools; Learn+; Mastery Learning; Online Platforms; Pivot-tables; Science Course; Science Education; Students","Data Science; Education computing; 'current; Complex transformations; Data science education; Educational tools; Learn+; Mastery learning; Online platforms; Pivot-tables; Science course; Science education; Students","","2nd International Workshop on Data Systems Education Bridging Education Practice with Education Research, (2023); Berman, Francine, Realizing the potential of data science, Communications of the ACM, 61, 4, pp. 67-72, (2018); Garcia, Daniel D., A's for All (As Time and Interest Allow), 1, pp. 1042-1048, (2023); Lau, Samuel, The Challenges of Evolving Technical Courses at Scale: Four Case Studies of Updating Large Data Science Courses, pp. 201-211, (2022); Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Data Systems Education Bridging Education Practice with Education Research, (2023); Theobold, Allison S., Human Centered Data Science: Ungrading in an Introductory Data Science Course, Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE, 1, pp. 327-333, (2023); Weinman, Nathaniel, Improving instruction of programming paterns with faded parsons problems, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, (2021)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","9798400704246; 9798400704239","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189133920"

Prior work on similar AI models has shown that they perform well on typical intro-level Computer Science problems. However, little is known about the performance of such tools on Data Science (DS) problems. In this work, we assess the performance of ChatGPT on assignments from three DS courses with varying difficulty levels. First, we apply the raw assignment prompts provided to the students and find that ChatGPT performs well on assignments with dataset(s) descriptions and progressive question prompts, which divide the programming requirements into sub-problems. Then, we perform prompt engineering on the assignments for which ChatGPT had low performance. We find that the following prompt engineering techniques significantly increased ChatGPT's performance: breaking down abstract questions into steps, breaking down steps into multiple prompts, providing descriptions of the dataset(s), including algorithmic details, adding specific instructions to entice specific actions, and removing extraneous information. Finally, we discuss how our findings suggest potential changes to curriculum design of DS courses.","Data Science Education; Large Language Models; Prompt Engineering; Data Science; Education Computing; Breakings; Data Science Education; Language Model; Large Language Model; Natural Languages; Performance; Prompt Engineering; Question Prompts; Science Course; Science Education; Curricula","Data Science; Education computing; Breakings; Data science education; Language model; Large language model; Natural languages; Performance; Prompt engineering; Question prompts; Science course; Science education; Curricula","","Openai Chatgpt, (2023); Prompt Engineering Learn how to Use Ai Models with Prompt Engineering, (2023); Ask Me Anything A Simple Strategy for Prompting Language Models, (2022); Program Synthesis with Large Language Models, (2021); Education in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence AI Understanding the Potential Benefits of Chatgpt in Promoting Teaching and Learning, (2023); Becker, Brett A., Programming Is Hard - or at Least It Used to Be: Educational Opportunities and Challenges of AI Code Generation, 1, pp. 500-506, (2023); Biderman, Stella, Fooling MOSS Detection with Pretrained Language Models, International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings, pp. 2933-2943, (2022); Brown, Tom B., Language models are few-shot learners, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020-December, (2020); Data Science Programming Ii, (2023); Training and Evaluating A Jupyter Notebook Data Science Assistant, (2022)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","9798400704246; 9798400704239","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189289268"

As demand for skilled data scientists rises, data science education must prepare students not only with technical proficiency but also with the ability to make informed, data-driven decisions. Understanding the consequences of their decisions is crucial for data scientists. However, many data science students struggle to develop decision making skills due to insufficient practical experience and lack of exposure to real-world scenarios in their training. To address this gap, integrating realistic, interactive learning environments into educational platforms is essential. This paper presents a systematic literature review, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, to explore notable features of learning environments that enhance practical learning in data science education. The review identifies a significant need for platforms that enable students to engage with scenarios replicating real world decision-making complexities. Evidence from fields like business, healthcare, and engineering shows that gamification can enhance decision-making skills, suggesting similar approaches could be effective in data science education. By analyzing existing literature, this paper demonstrates the potential of gamified platforms to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, better preparing future data scientists with technical skills and informed decision-making abilities.","Data Science Education; Decision-making; Gamification; Platforms; Adversarial Machine Learning; Contrastive Learning; Federated Learning; Data Driven Decision; Data Science Education; Decisions Makings; Gamification; Learning Platform; Platform; Research Domains; Science Education; Skills Development; Systematic Review; Data Science","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Data driven decision; Data science education; Decisions makings; Gamification; Learning platform; Platform; Research domains; Science education; Skills development; Systematic Review; Data Science","","Role of the Data Scientist within Smart Cities; Bureau of Labor Statistics, (2024); Takahashi, Satoshi, Data Science in an Agent-Based Simulation World, (2023); Hicks, Stephanie C., A Guide to Teaching Data Science, American Statistician, 72, 4, pp. 382-391, (2018); Durán-Rosal, Antonio Manuel, Gamifying the Classroom for the Acquisition of Skills Associated with Machine Learning: A Two-Year Case Study, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 532 LNNS, pp. 224-235, (2023); Lampropoulos, Georgios, Virtual reality and gamification in education: a systematic review, Educational Technology Research and Development, 72, 3, pp. 1691-1785, (2024); Ai4k12, (2022); Stojanova, Aleksandra, Application of VARK learning model on 'Data structures and algorithms' course, IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON, pp. 613-620, (2017); Interactions, (2012); Mlac J Arts Commerce Sci, (2024)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9798331517878","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218451887"

Over the last five years there has been a significant growing interest in the technology's use by both educators and researchers exploring the applicability for active learning and student engagement. However, an essential consideration for its use in education is engagement with the end users during the design processes. For that reason, a hackathon was organised by Wageningen University to engage with students in order to design and develop XR applications for data science education. Hackathons have become more commonplace over the last 10 years, in particular due to their success for creating innovation and enhancing engagement with students. In this research, the results of the hackathon are presented along with the challenges and opportunities associated with the implementation of such pedagogical activities. Our findings indicate that XR-based gamification of education has potential valid application for improving the way elements of the data science pipeline are taught, and that a student-led design process demonstrated a preference for the use of virtual reality over augmented reality. The results reveal that the usefulness of XR to foster learning is evaluated positively with a mean score of M=5.82 and SD=0.98 on a 7-point Likert-scale.","Education; Extended Reality; Hackathon; Virtual Reality; Data Science; Virtual Reality; Active Learning; Augmented-mixed Reality; Augmented/virtual Reality; Design-process; Essential Considerations; Extended Reality; Hackathon; Science Education; Student Engagement; Technology Use; Virtual Environments","Data Science; Virtual reality; Active Learning; Augmented-mixed reality; Augmented/virtual reality; Design-process; Essential considerations; Extended reality; Hackathon; Science education; Student engagement; Technology use; Virtual environments","The authors would like to thank, firstly, the Wageningen University students who took part in the Data Factory event.

Data science requires knowledge and skills in various fields, which makes many learners give up in the process. To prevent learners from being discouraged, it is necessary to judge the comprehension of the principles in each specified skill. Writing questions are effective in examining comprehension. However, difficulties arise when examining comprehension from writing questions. For each specified skill, this method provides us with a method to examine whether learner answers to writing questions are close to the correct answer. The Word2vec method calculates the distance of the document vector of learner answers from that of the answer sentence. The distance discriminates learners lacking comprehension from others in the skill. The method uses the Naïve Bayes Model to figure out important words for each skill. Learners lacking comprehension fail to use the important words in their answers. A logistic regression model to discriminate learners in terms of comprehension reveals the words, which contribute to identifying the concepts they fail to understand and the procedures they fail to associate with the concepts. The experimental results show that the method can determine what the learner has understood. Furthermore, it identifies the important words in classifying learners lacking comprehension from others. The words appearing in answers of learners who understand and those who do not are extremely far in their distributed representation. It suggests that it is possible to identify concepts and procedures that learners do not understand from the words they use. It enables us to offer suggestions to assist learners who are likely to be stuck.","Data Science Education; Text Analysis; Writing Questions; Data Science Education; Distributed Representation; Document Vectors; It Identify; Logistic Regression Modeling; Naive Bayes Models; Science Education; Text Analysis; Writing Question; Data Science","Data science education; Distributed representation; Document vectors; IT Identify; Logistic Regression modeling; Naive Bayes models; Science education; Text analysis; Writing question; Data Science","","Hedges, Sarai, ADDRESSING CONFIRMATION BIAS in MIDDLE SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, Foundations of Data Science, 5, 2, pp. 223-243, (2023); Zhang, Harry, The optimality of Naive Bayes, 2, pp. 562-567, (2004); Berry, Michael W., Algorithms and applications for approximate nonnegative matrix factorization, Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 52, 1, pp. 155-173, (2007); Berry, Michael W., Document classification using nonnegative matrix factorization and underapproximation, Proceedings - IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, pp. 2782-2785, (2009); Lee, Daniel D., Learning the parts of objects by non-negative matrix factorization, Nature, 401, 6755, pp. 788-791, (1999); Icml, (2014); Aaai 98 Workshop on Learning for Text Categorization, (1998); Brassil, Chad E., Multiple-true-false questions reveal more thoroughly the complexity of student thinking than multiple-choice questions: a Bayesian item response model comparison, International Journal of STEM Education, 6, 1, (2019); Jsise2017; Ashraf, Shahzad, Iris and Foot based Sustainable Biometric Identification Approach, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9798350353235","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215674458"

Yet data is often treated as neutral and value-free, perpetuating narratives of science as a dispassionate discipline where data are merely extracted, repackaged, and distributed anew. As researchers and educators seek to imagine, design and support more humanistic accounts of young people's data practices, attuning to emotion will be a key area for further study. Recent scholarship in science education has elevated emotion as inseparable from disciplinary knowledge-building practices, yet studies of emotion emergent within young people's data practices remain less understood. As part of the special issue Centering Affect and Emotion Toward Justice and Dignity in Science Education, this article explores how emotion and data are co-produced as children construct and critique data visualizations together, collectively transforming notes, tallies and sketches into class-level aggregated data displays within a fifth grade ecology curriculum. Analyzing interviews, classroom video recordings, and newly constructed data visualizations, I reveal how feeling, sensemaking and practice are entangled as children and their classmates build a paper data map and a dot plot graph, shaped by personal, cultural and sociopolitical dimensions. I show how these emergent emotional configurations shift activity from collaborative to competitive, in turn changing attention to the data itself (properties, histories, visualizations), the underlying organisms being studied and the ecological system-level interactions. I argue that as science and data science education push forward a zeal for data, it will be important to attune to the emotional and relational dimensions that undergird children's emergent data practices.","","","Thank you to the educators, colleagues and children who were so generous with their thoughts, ideas and feelings.

In this paper, we use a broad definition of data science to outline three foundational aspects that could be addressed during the schooling years: (1) reasoning with data; (2) computational thinking; and (3) inquiry-based learning. Drawing on video data and artefacts from a primary classroom in Australia (children aged 9–10 years old), we examined how a class generated and grappled with a complex, ambiguous problem about the risks and benefits of their activities in cyberspace. The interdisciplinary lesson sequence engaged the children with non-standard data, data privacy, and ethical issues in age-appropriate ways. The analysis used an iterative process that annotated video logs, identified and transcribed critical events linked to these three foundational aspects, and coded these data to make connections within and across the data. The findings suggest a process for introducing children to age-appropriate problems that can be addressed by data science that reflect contexts in their world.

Employing a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed quantitative data on peer review metrics (word count, sentiment, and complexity) and qualitative insights from student comments from 2019 to 2021. Our findings indicate a positive correlation between higher student grades and more detailed, positive peer reviews, as measured by word count, sentiment, and keyword matches. While the overall changes in engagement metrics were not statistically significant, trends suggest increased engagement over time. These findings contribute to a growing body of research on the effectiveness of peer review in online learning environments and highlight its potential to foster student development in data science. Future research should address limitations such as sample size and explore broader applications across diverse online courses.

By incorporating art production, we designed a data-art inquiry program to teach students data science basics and enable them to use art techniques to visualize their data. To understand how students established connections between data and art, we employed epistemic network analysis (ENA) at two levels to explore how they combine their data practices and art processes. Our study had three primary findings: (1) students have a personalized way of combining data and art; (2) data collection appears to be a key practice in our data-art inquiry program; (3) art production empowers students to better understand and communicate their data.

This growth indicates a recognition of the critical role that data plays in shaping our understanding of complex issues in today's data-driven society. It also underscores the need for data science education to be accessible, representative, and tailored to a wide array of learners and professionals. The work to date to establish a data science foundational knowledge framework represents a pivotal step in formalizing and enhancing data science education. Yet, these frameworks have been largely designed for those pursuing data science careers. The field is in need of a data science framework that focuses on the essential introductory knowledge and skills for non-CS students to build a solid foundation in data science.

As a solution, Nolan and Speed advocated for bringing applications to the forefront in undergraduate statistics curriculum with the use of in-depth case studies to encourage and develop statistical thinking in the classroom. Limitations to this approach include the significant time investment required to develop a case study—namely, to select a motivating question and to create an illustrative data analysis—and the domain expertise needed. As a result, case studies based on realistic challenges, not toy examples, are scarce. To address this, we developed the Open Case Studies (opencasestudies.org) project, which offers a new statistical and data science education case study model. This educational resource provides self-contained, multimodal, peer-reviewed, and open-source guides (or case studies) from real-world examples for active experiences of complete data analyses. We developed an educator’s guide describing how to most effectively use the case studies, how to modify and adapt components of the case studies in the classroom, and how to contribute new case studies (opencasestudies.org/OCS_Guide).","Applied Statistics; Case Studies; Computing; Data Science; Education; Statistical Thinking","","The Open Case Study project reported in this publication was supported by a High-Impact Project grant in 2019-2020 by the Bloomberg American Health Initiative to create the majority of the case studies currently part of the project.

Digital transformation of industries is fueling an exponential growth in global datasphere, enabled by advances in data-measuring smart devices, Internet of Things and cloud computing. The oil/gas sector is not left out of the data revolution. A recent report indicated that about 80,000 sensors generate 2 terabytes/day data on an average offshore platform. The need to transform oilfield data into insights for optimal decision-making is opening up career frontiers in petroleum data science. An increase in demand for talents in petroleum data science is in view. In anticipation of this, the Data Science and Engineering Analytics Technical Section of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, African Region is collaborating with the academia, towards producing graduate engineers possessing domain knowledge and data mining skills. As part of the collaboration, we now present a framework for the incorporation of data science education into petroleum engineering undergraduate programs. In line with Outcome-based Education approach, a set of learning outcomes for a proposed petroleum data analytics and machine learning course is presented, first. These learning outcomes are framed as skills and competencies expected of students at course completion. Thereafter, assessment rubrics and use case examples are mapped to each learning outcome. These rubrics serves as evidential basis for ascertaining that the skills have been acquired. In completing the curriculum design, a sequence of lesson and lab modules are enlisted as contents over which learners must gain mastery in order to meet the criteria of the assessment rubrics. Furthermore, various elements that make up an integrated learning experience are presented. These include open-access learning resources and toolbox, open-access data sources, instructional strategies, capstone project ideas, research prospects, and industry support (mentorship and advisory). The future prospects of this initiative are also discussed. Some elements of this framework, as presented in this paper, are currently being implemented in a quasi-classroom setting; preliminary performance reports are included in this paper.","Curricula; Drilling Platforms; Gas Industry; Gasoline; Offshore Oil Well Production; Offshore Oil Wells; Offshore Petroleum Prospecting; Oil Well Flooding; Petroleum Engineering; Petroleum Industry; Petroleum Research; Petroleum Tar; Teaching; Assessment Rubrics; Data Analytics; Data Measuring; Digital Transformation; Engineering Undergraduates; Exponential Growth; Learning Outcome; Machine-learning; Openaccess; Smart Devices; Students","Curricula; Drilling platforms; Gas industry; Gasoline; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Offshore petroleum prospecting; Oil well flooding; Petroleum engineering; Petroleum industry; Petroleum research; Petroleum tar; Teaching; Assessment rubrics; Data analytics; Data measuring; Digital transformation; Engineering undergraduates; Exponential growth; Learning outcome; Machine-learning; OpenAccess; Smart devices; Students","First, inspirations from the only wise God are acknowledged.

Previous research has failed to distinguish two features commonly associated with embodiment: sensorimotor engagement and visuospatial concreteness. In the current research, we ask whether sensorimotor engagement—operationalized as watching a video of hands manipulating paper representations—offers unique benefits beyond the visuospatial concreteness of a dynamic visualization of the same process. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions to learn about the shuffle() function in R: a Watch HandsMoving Objects group, which watched a video with hands; a Watch Moving Objects group, which watched a video with a dynamic visualization in which objects moved without hands; or a control group, which watched a live-coding video that did not include either hands or visuospatial representations. Results revealed that only participants in the Watch Hands Moving Objects group demonstrated significantly superior performance compared with both the Watch Moving Objects group and control groups. These findings highlight the unique benefit of sensorimotor engagement for learning, contributing to a deeper understanding of how embodiment can enhance the learning process.","Data Science Education; Dynamic Visualization; Embodied Cognition; Multimedia Learning; Sensorimotor Engagement; Adult; Female; Hand; Human; Learning; Male; Physiology; Psychomotor Performance; Vision; Young Adult; Adult; Female; Hand; Humans; Learning; Male; Psychomotor Performance; Visual Perception; Young Adult","adult; female; hand; human; learning; male; physiology; psychomotor performance; vision; young adult; Adult; Female; Hand; Humans; Learning; Male; Psychomotor Performance; Visual Perception; Young Adult","The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

The field of data science, particularly data-driven artificial intelligence and machine learning, has expanded considerably, with many applications and a growing social and scientific debate on ethical issues, opportunities, and risks. Therefore, there is a discourse on updating educational goals and content at the school level to prepare citizens for their future life in a “data society.” An updated conception of statistical literacy implies new educational requirements, with a view toward developments in the sciences, ubiquity of data, and societal and cultural impacts. The use of digital tools is an essential part of these new approaches. In this chapter, four in-depth examples of new, technology-driven content for secondary education are provided to show the impact of digital resources on goals and contents of statistics education. These examples explore the impact on data analysis, statistical inference, statistical modeling, and data collection. The examples also show how digital tools can be adapted to the students’ capabilities and needs to serve a dual role in education, namely, supporting students in learning and doing statistics.","Data Collection; Data Explorations; Data Science Education; Educational Technology; Impact Of Digitalisation; Learning Decision Trees; Machine Learning Education; Secondary Students; Simulation-based Inference; Statistics Education","","","Statistical Investigative Questions an Enquiry into Posing and Answering Investigative Questions from Existing Data, (2013); Arnold, Pip, What Makes a Good Statistical Question?, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 29, 1, pp. 122-130, (2021); Arnold, Pip, Enhancing students' inferential reasoning: From hands-on to ""movies, Journal of Statistics Education, 19, 2, (2011); Challenge of Developing Statistical Literacy Reasoning and Thinking, (2004); Pre K 12 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education II Gaise II, (2020); Explorative Datenanalyse Eine Untersuchung Aus Der Perspektive Einer Deskriptiv Empirischen Wissenschaftstheorie, (1982); Software Tools and Mathematics Education the Case of Statistics, (1993); Biehler, Rolf, Software for learning and for doing statistics, International Statistical Review, 65, 2, pp. 167-189, (1997); Proceedings of the Third International Virtual Congress of Statistical Education, (2019); Biehler, Rolf, Introducing students to machine learning with decision trees using CODAP and Jupyter Notebooks, Teaching Statistics, 43, S1, pp. S133-S142, (2021)","","Springer Nature","21971951; 2197196X","","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200565217"

There is a need to increase students’ competencies to be able to take on bioinformatic careers, to get them familiarized with scientific professions in data science and the academic training required to pursue them, in a field where demand outweighs the supply. Methods: Here we implemented a set of bioinformatic activities into a protein structure and function course of a graduate program. Concisely, students were given hands-on opportunities to explore the bioinformatics-based analyses of biomolecular data and structural biology via a semester-long case study structured as inquiry-based bioinformatics exercises. Towards the end of the term, the students also designed and presented an assignment project that allowed them to document the unknown protein that they identified using bioinformatic knowledge during the term. Results: The post-module survey responses and students’ performances in the lab module imply that it furthered an in-depth knowledge of bioinformatics. Despite having not much prior knowledge of bioinformatics prior to taking this module students indicated positive feedback. Conclusion: The students got familiar with cross-indexed databases that interlink important data about proteins, enzymes as well as genes. The essential skillsets honed by this research-based bioinformatic pedagogical approach will empower students to be able to leverage this knowledge for their future endeavours in the bioinformatics field.","Amino Acid Sequence; Bioinformatics; Chimera; Homology Modeling; Nucleotide Sequence; Pedagogy; Protein; Proteins; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Biochemistry; Bioinformatics; Computer Language; Data Analysis; Data Base; Data Science; Enzymology; Human; Learning; Likert Scale; Medical Education; Metabolomics; Modular Inquiry Based Semester Theme; Molecular Biology; Molecular Docking; Multiple Sequence Alignment; Open Reading Frame; Positive Feedback; Protein Structure; Protein Structure Function Course; Questionnaire; Science Education; Sequence Alignment; Simulation Training; Software; Structure Analysis; Training; Chemistry; Curriculum; Education; Genetics; Procedures; Student; Protein; Computational Biology; Curriculum; Data Science; Humans; Proteins; Students","amino acid sequence; Article; biochemistry; bioinformatics; computer language; data analysis; data base; data science; enzymology; human; learning; Likert scale; medical education; metabolomics; modular inquiry based semester theme; molecular biology; molecular docking; multiple sequence alignment; open reading frame; positive feedback; protein structure; protein structure function course; questionnaire; science education; sequence alignment; simulation training; software; structure analysis; training; chemistry; curriculum; education; genetics; procedures; student; protein; Computational Biology; Curriculum; Data Science; Humans; Proteins; Students","We thank MMB students at Chem/Biochem department at Windsor University, who consented to the surveys and their data.

Increasing the accessibility of data science to these communities not only benefits the individuals entering data science, but also increases the field's innovation and potential impact as a whole. Education is the most scalable solution to meet these needs, but many data science educators lack formal training in education. Our group has led education efforts for a variety of audiences: from professional scientists to high school students to lay audiences. These experiences have helped form our teaching philosophy which we have summarized into three main ideals: 1) motivation, 2) inclusivity, and 3) realism. 20 we also aim to iteratively update our teaching approaches and curriculum as we find ways to better reach these ideals.

Statistics and data science education research offers a variety of frameworks for understanding variability, but new frameworks for domain applications are necessary. This study investigated the professional practices of working engineers to develop such a framework. The Neglected, Acknowledged, or Targeted (NAT) Taxonomy describes whether one’s data analysis choices engage with variability, and whether those choices target the potential consequences of variability, within a given domain. A targeted analysis is the most beneficial rung for engineering applications and is therefore a useful concept for instruction. This study describes the qualitative methods used to develop the NAT Taxonomy and describes how the taxonomy can be used in statistics and data science education, particularly in support of other domain applications.","Engineering Education; Professional Practice; Variability","","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant no. 2138463.

Addressing this gap, we developed the Health Gym project, a free and open-source platform designed to generate synthetic health data sets applicable to various areas of data science education, including machine learning, data visualization, and traditional statistical models. Initially, we generated 3 synthetic data sets for sepsis, acute hypotension, and antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection. This paper discusses the educational applications of Health Gym's synthetic data sets. We illustrate this through their use in postgraduate health data science courses delivered by the University of New South Wales, Australia, and a Datathon event, involving academics, students, clinicians, and local health district professionals. We also include adaptable worked examples using our synthetic data sets, designed to enrich hands-on tutorial and workshop experiences.

A mixed-methods approach, integrating focus group interviews and questionnaire surveys conducted over three rounds of data collection, was employed. The collected data underwent rigorous reliability and validity analyses utilizing SPSS software. An Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) was executed to construct a performance chart, evaluating the effectiveness of a 24-item framework designed to encompass key aspects of data science education. The initial internal consistency α coefficients for Questionnaire 2 and Questionnaire 3 were found to be .892 and .913, respectively, surpassing the 0.7 threshold, indicating a high level of reliability for all items related to data science competencies. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measurements approaching approximately 0.9 affirmed the efficiency of the questionnaire, specifically designed to gauge the relevance and effectiveness of data science-related indicators in the context of applied talent cultivation and regional economic development. Furthermore, the study underscores the significance of indicators such as teamwork, regional market research, and business opportunity identification within the domain of data science. It identifies gaps between key indicators and lower-performing indicators, proposing strategic improvement measures to enhance the alignment of applied talent cultivation objectives with the evolving needs of regional economic development, particularly in the data science landscape. The research findings not only contribute to a foundational understanding of data science competencies in applied talent cultivation but also lay the groundwork for innovative reforms in future talent cultivation models. By clarifying objectives and better aligning them with the dynamic demands of regional economic development, this study sets the stage for transformative advancements in the field of applied talent cultivation, particularly within the realm of data science.","Applied Talent Cultivation; Data Science Competencies; Importance-performance Analysis (ipa); Regional Economic Development","","","Bian, Yijie, Research on influencing factors of artificial intelligence multi-cloud scheduling applied talent training based on DEMATEL-TAISM, Journal of Cloud Computing, 11, 1, (2022); de Almeida, Maria Da Glória Diniz, Industrial internship mentoring model for industrial engineering education in public universities, International Journal of Engineering Education, 36, 1A, pp. 48-65, (2020); Fu, Jiayi, Economic and resource and environmental carrying capacity trade-off analysis in the Haihe River basin in China, Journal of Cleaner Production, 270, (2020); Han, Qiuhong, Using neural network for the evaluation of physical education teaching in colleges and universities, Soft Computing, 26, 20, pp. 10699-10705, (2022); Shs Web of Conferen, (2023); Jiang, Long, Evaluation and prediction of the level of high-quality development: A case study of the Yellow River Basin, China, Ecological Indicators, 129, (2021); Cognitive Learning Theory and Development Higher Education Case Study, (2023); Li, Yongmei, Utilizing the Delphi Technique to Develop a Self-Regulated Learning Model, Journal of Applied Data Sciences, 4, 3, pp. 254-263, (2023); Morgan, David L., Focus groups, Annual Review of Sociology, 22, pp. 129-152, (1996); Qin, Shengyang, An Introduction to Human Resources for Development and Innovation, Science Transformation into Industry Infrastructure by China’s New Universities: A Case Study of Green Materials, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 2, (2023)","","Bright Publisher","27236471","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185971521"

In Japanese university students’ standard data science curriculum, group work based on AI application examples is recommended to motivate students to learn data science. All university students who have just graduated from high school may not have sufficient basic data science knowledge, and their understanding of its importance may differ from person to person. Under these circumstances, it is unclear whether an introduction to AI applications would be practical as an introductory education to data science. Therefore, in this study, we designed a lesson including group work based on a case study of using AI technology in job interviews.

Feature selection, enabled by RF, is often among the very first tasks in a data science project, such as the college capstone project, industry consulting projects. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of 12 RF-based feature selection methods for classification problems. The review provides necessary description of each method and the software packages. We show that different methods typically do not provide consistent feature selection results, and the model performance also varies when different RF-based feature selection approaches are employed. This observation suggests that caution must be taken when performing feature selection tasks using RF. Feature selection cannot be blindly done without a sound understanding of the methods adopted, which is not always the case in industry and many senior capstone projects that we have observed. The paper serves as a one-stop reference where students, data science consultants, engineers, and data scientists can access the basic ideas behind these methods, the advantages and limitations of different approaches, as well as the software packages to implement these methods.","Capstone Projects; Classification; Data Science Consulting Projects; Data Science Education; Feature Importance; Feature Selection; Random Forest; Data Science; Education Computing; Feature Selection; Learning Systems; Software Packages; Capstone Projects; Consulting Projects; Data Science Consulting Project; Data Science Education; Feature Importance; Feature Selection Methods; Features Selection; Random Forests; Science Applications; Science Education; Classification (of Information)","Data Science; Education computing; Feature Selection; Learning systems; Software packages; Capstone projects; Consulting projects; Data science consulting project; Data science education; Feature importance; Feature selection methods; Features selection; Random forests; Science applications; Science education; Classification (of information)","This material was partially supported by the National Science Foundation under Award No. OIA-1946391.","Altmann, André, Permutation importance: A corrected feature importance measure, Bioinformatics, 26, 10, pp. 1340-1347, (2010); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Calle, M.

To illustrate this argument, we explore the production of visuality within data science education as one example of how the visual manifests within schools. In response, we propose a visual literacy informed approach to engaging students with data, one that expands beyond contemporary forms of critical data literacy by involving an ontological critique of educational aestheticization. To ground this work, we examine the role of visuality and aesthetics within the implementation of co-designed arts-infused data science projects in four US middle schools. In analyzing interviews with teachers and students, we uncover a series of tensions that reveal the ongoing influence of school visualities alongside the potential for student generated images to amplify their right to look. We therefore argue that critical pedagogies must not only involve reading and critiquing aesthetic artifacts but also engage students in a critique of visuality itself.","Aesthetics; Data Literacy; Data Science Education; Right To Look; Visual Cultures; Visual Literacy","","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation through a collaborative Discovery Research K-12 award [1908557, 1908142, 1908030].

Computer Science educators have investigated how students debug their own code and how students reason through foreign code. While these studies illuminate different aspects of students’ programming behavior or conceptual understanding, a method has yet to be employed that can shed light on students’ learning processes. This type of inquiry necessitates qualitative methods, which allow for a holistic description of the skills a student uses throughout the computing code they produce, the organization of these descriptions into themes, and a comparison of the emergent themes across students or across time. In this article we share how to conceptualize and carry out the qualitative coding process with students’ computing code. Drawing on the Block Model to frame our analysis, we explore two types of research questions which could be posed about students’ learning.

Different from some commonly seen model fitting criteria in statistics, such as the ordinary least squares criterion and the maximum likelihood method, its algorithm depends on an optimization problem under constraints, which is unconventional to many students in a second or third course in statistics or data science. As a result, this topic is often not as intuitive to students as some of the more traditional statistical modeling tools. In order to facilitate students’ mastery of the topic and promote active learning, we developed some in-class activities and their accompanying Shiny applications for teaching support vector classifiers. The designed course materials aim at engaging students through group work and solidifying students’ understanding of the algorithm via hands-on explorations. The Shiny applications offer interactive demonstration of the changes of the components of a support vector classifier when altering its determining parameters. With the goal of benefiting the broader statistics and data science education community, we have made the developed Shiny applications publicly available.

In translating scholarship around culturally relevant pedagogy from the fields of education and mathematics education we develop the idea of culturally relevant data. We see this development as a key ingredient to implementing culturally relevant pedagogy in teaching data-intensive courses leveraging the centrality of context through data in both statistics and data science to engage students particularly from historically marginalized groups in STEM. We provide suggestions as to ways of finding or creating culturally relevant data and using them in implementing culturally relevant pedagogy to support the learning and flourishing of students in statistics and data science courses.

As a result, there is a growing body of research regarding how to teach interdisciplinary collaboration skills. However, much of the work evaluating methods of teaching statistics and data science collaboration relies primarily on self-reflection data. Additionally, prior research lacks detailed methods for assessing the quality of collaboration skills. In this case study, we present a method for teaching statistics and data science collaboration, a framework for identifying elements of effective collaboration, and a comparative case study to evaluate the collaboration skills of both a team of students and an experienced collaborator on two components of effective data science collaboration: structuring a collaboration meeting and communicating with a domain expert. Results show that the students could facilitate meetings and communicate comparably well to the experienced collaborator, but that the experienced collaborator was better able to facilitate meetings and communicate to develop strong relationships, an important element for high-quality and long-term collaboration. Further work is needed to generalize these findings to a larger population, but these results begin to inform the field regarding effective ways to teach specific data science collaboration skills.","Case Study; Data Science Collaboration; Data Science Education; Statistical Consulting; Statistical Practice","","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1955109 and Grant No. 2022138 for the projects, \u201CIGE: Transforming the Education and Training of Interdisciplinary Data Scientists (TETRDIS)\u201D and \u201CNRT-HDR: Integrated Data Science (Int dS): Teams for Advancing Bioscience Discovery.\u201D This work was also supported by the United States Agency for International Development under Cooperative Agreement Number 7200AA18CA00022 for the project, \u201CLISA 2020: Creating Institutional Statistical Analysis and Data Science Capacity to Transform Evidence to Action.\u201D The authors report there are no acknowledgments to declare.","Math Better Explained Learn to Unlock Your Math Intuition, (2015); Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Teaching Statistics, (2002); Training Researchers in the Use of Statistics, (2001); Davidson, Mario A., Teaching Communication in a Statistical Collaboration Course: A Feasible, Project-Based, Multimodal Curriculum, American Statistician, 73, 1, pp. 61-69, (2019); In Proceedings of the International Conference on Teaching Statistics Icots6, (2002); Kimball, A.

The current norm for data science education predominantly focuses on graduate programs, which presume a preexisting knowledge base in one or more relevant sciences. However, this framework often overlooks those who don’t plan to pursue graduate studies, thereby limiting their exposure to this rapidly expanding field. Penn State addressed this gap by establishing one of the first undergraduate degree programs in data sciences, a collaboration between the College of Information Sciences and Technology, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and the Department of Statistics. One key component of this program is a project-focused, writing-intensive course designed for upper-class undergraduates. This course guides students through the entire data science project pipeline, from prob-lem identification to solution presentation. It allows students to apply foundational data science principles to real-world problems, advancing their understanding through practical application. This chapter details the objectives, rationale, and course design, alongside reflections from our teaching experience. The insights provided could be helpful to instructors developing similar data science programs or courses at an undergraduate level, broadening the influence of this important field.","Interdisciplinary Curriculum; Interpersonal Skills; Intrapersonal Skills; Project-based Learning; Undergraduate Data Science Education; Curricula; Data Mining; Data Science; Engineering Education; Information Use; Stem (science, Technology, Engineering And Mathematics); Teaching; Computational Science; Interdisciplinary Curriculum; Interpersonal Skills; Intrapersonal Skill; Problem-solving; Project Based Learning; Science Education; Science Projects; Statistic Modeling; Undergraduate Data Science Education; Students","Curricula; Data mining; Data Science; Engineering education; Information use; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Teaching; Computational science; Interdisciplinary curriculum; Interpersonal skills; Intrapersonal skill; Problem-solving; Project based learning; Science education; Science projects; Statistic modeling; Undergraduate data science education; Students","","Aletras, Nikolaos, Predicting judicial decisions of the European court of human rights: A natural language processing perspective, PeerJ Computer Science, 2016, 10, (2016); The importance of continuous learning for innovation, progression and survival, Business Information Review, 35, 1, pp. 6-8, (2018); Cadena, Cesar, Past, present, and future of simultaneous localization and mapping: Toward the robust-perception age, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 32, 6, pp. 1309-1332, (2016); Cao, Zhe, OpenPose: Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation Using Part Affinity Fields, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 43, 1, pp. 172-186, (2021); Neurips, (2020); Chen, Yushi, Deep learning-based classification of hyperspectral data, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 7, 6, pp. 2094-2107, (2014); Cho, Kyunghyun, Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation, pp. 1724-1734, (2014); Cortes, Corinna, Support-Vector Networks, Machine Learning, 20, 3, pp. 273-297, (1995); Datta, Ritendra, Studying aesthetics in photographic images using a computational approach, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3953 LNCS, pp. 288-301, (2006); Devlin, Jacob, BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, 1, pp. 4171-4186, (2019)","","Springer Nature","","9783031612909; 9783031612893","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005667226"

It presents a theoretical and practical framework that leverages cultural backgrounds to enhance the teaching and learning processes in computational data mining. The main objective of this research is to demonstrate how integrating CRC can improve educational experiences by making them more inclusive and engaging for students from diverse cultural backgrounds. By applying CRC, educators can tailor learning experiences that transmit technical skills and conceptual knowledge and resonate more deeply with students' personal and social identities. This approach has the potential to foster deeper engagement and understanding of the material, thereby enhancing learning outcomes. Our research operates within the broader context of ongoing efforts to integrate data science across K-12 education, advocating for educational practices that acknowledge and utilize students' cultural identities as assets rather than deficits. The theoretical foundations for these practices are rooted in existing literature that emphasizes the importance of culturally relevant pedagogies in computing and data science education. Implementing these frameworks in classroom settings represents a vital intersection of educational research and practice, aiming to address disparities in engagement and achievement among minority students. This work leverages qualitative analysis of how high school students utilize their cultural and social orientations within a structured 'coding like a data miner' workshop. The dataset includes students' final project presentations, which showcase their ability to integrate cultural relevance into their epistemic data science practices. We highlight how these integrations influence learners' understanding of and engagement with data science concepts.

We analyze the course structures and prerequisites of these courses in computing departments at 50 Research-1 institutions in the United States, recognized for their 'Very High Research Activity.' Our methodology involves analyzing course syllabi to examine the structure and prerequisites of these courses, using open coding to develop a unified codebook to identify prerequisites and determine the earliest exposure levels for students. A clustering analysis was also conducted to identify common and differing curriculum approaches among institutions. Results show that data science courses require less initial exposure, while artificial intelligence and machine learning courses require more prerequisites. Standard requirements for artificial intelligence courses include basic data structure (Computer Science 2) and algorithms, with machine learning courses requiring more mathematics preparation. Moreover, public institutions offer advanced courses with more prerequisites compared to private institutions. Overall, this study recognizes considerable diversity in curricular frameworks across Research-1 institutions and encourages institutions to revise curricula to broaden access to artificial intelligence education and increase participation in research.","Academic Retention; Artificial Intelligence; Curriculum Design; Data Science; Machine Learning; Prerequisites; Adversarial Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Curricula; Data Science; Students; Academic Retention; Artificial Intelligence Course; Comparative Analyzes; Curricula Design; Learning Course; Machine Data; Machine-learning; Prerequisite; Science Education; Student Access; Contrastive Learning","Adversarial machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Data Science; Students; Academic retention; Artificial intelligence course; Comparative analyzes; Curricula design; Learning course; Machine data; Machine-learning; Prerequisite; Science education; Student access; Contrastive Learning","","Reddy, Sandeep, A governance model for the application of AI in health care, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 27, 3, pp. 491-497, (2020); Cao, Longbing, AI in Finance: Challenges, Techniques, and Opportunities, ACM Computing Surveys, 55, 3, (2022); Rajan, Kanna, Towards a science of integrated AI and Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, 247, pp. 1-9, (2017); Ai People and Society, (2017); Urtasun-Alonso, Ainhoa, Empowering undergraduates through machine learning, Industry and Higher Education, 37, 3, pp. 443-447, (2023); Langley, Pat W., An integrative framework for artificial intelligence education, pp. 9670-9677, (2019); Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Innovation, (2018); Barretto, Daphne, Exploring Why Underrepresented Students Are Less Likely to Study Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE, pp. 457-463, (2021); Wongvibulsin, Shannon, Educational strategies to foster diversity and inclusion in machine intelligence, Nature Machine Intelligence, 1, 2, pp. 70-71, (2019); Guide to Teaching Data Science, (2023)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15394565","9781424447152; 0780356438; 9781538611739; 9780780390775; 0780379616; 0780314824; 9780780308329; 9781509059195; 0780390776; 1424410843","PFECD","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000743391"

In the con-temporary landscape of computer science (CS) education at K-12 and higher levels, a visible shift towards data science-based teaching has emerged as a pivotal focus across diverse disciplines and age groups. The predominant goal is to equip students with the skills and mindset needed to actively participate as informed citizens, engaging in inquiries grounded in data that intersect with social and civic phenomena. This paradigm shift is catalyzed by the exponential growth of data production and a societal trend towards openness and information sharing, both of which are transformative forces shaping the economy and society. Numerous initiatives have been undertaken to enhance CS skills among K-12 students, with notable programs such as Bootstrap Data Science (BDS), Coding Like a Data Miner (CLDM), and Exploring Computer Science (ECS) leading the charge in integrating data science into the educational framework or curriculum using different perspectives on coding, social media data, and curated dataset. Despite these commendable efforts, a pressing concern appears over the efficacy of current pre-college data science-based CS education strategies. Often, these strategies involve the utilization of datasets and investigations curated by external entities, limiting learners' authentic practice, and constraining their exploration of meaningful lines of inquiry. This replication-centric approach impedes the development of comprehensive knowledge and mastery, hindering the cultivation of literacies with agency that allows learners to pursue per-sonal interests or address pertinent social issues. Simultaneously, governmental bodies at the local (e.g. opendataphilly.org), state (e.g. data.pa.gov), and federal levels (e.g. data.gov) have actively engaged in this educational evolution by opening up their data for access and reuse by public and private entities. The global phenomenon of Open Government Data has gained momentum in recent years, driven by the belief that its utilization possesses the potential to generate both economic and social value. However, there exists a substantial gap in effectively engaging students to harness this valuable resource for the creation of social value and it is due to a limited number of tools and curricula that create the intersection in the learning process. This paper investigates the critical intersection of data science and computer science education, proposing a transformative approach that em-powers learners through open inquiry using Open Government Data from Local (e.g. opendataphilly.org) State(data.pa.gov), and Federal(data.gov). By advocating for hands-on experiences that involve students in the generation and analysis of data relevant to real-world and local, state, and federal issues, our proposed framework seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. The framework includes the use of a data science tool that explores open government data, connects students' interests in an area (e.g. economy, public health, transportation), and helps in mining, analyzing, and visualizing based on student socio-cultural perspective through curriculum. Through a comprehensive exploration of Open Government Data, we aim to pave the way for a new era in Data Science-based CS education that not only equips students with technical skills but also inspires them with a sense of social responsibility and the ability to contribute meaningfully to societal challenges.","Culturally Relevant Computing; Cur-riculum Integration; Data Science Education; K-12 Education; Open Government Data; Data Science; Economic And Social Effects; Computer Science Education; Culturally Relevant Computing; Cur-riculum Integration; Data Science Education; Data-driven Approach; Higher Education Students; K-12 Education; Open Government Data; Science Education; Social Values; Students","Data Science; Economic and social effects; Computer Science Education; Culturally relevant computing; Cur-riculum integration; Data science education; Data-driven approach; Higher education students; K-12 education; Open government data; Science education; Social values; Students","","Hagen, Loni, Open data visualizations and analytics as tools for policy-making, Government Information Quarterly, 36, 4, (2019); Lee, Victor R., A Call for a Humanistic Stance Toward K–12 Data Science Education, Educational Researcher, 50, 9, pp. 664-672, (2021); NSF 10 Big Ideas Special Report NSF National Science Foundation Nsf Gov; Ikegwu, Anayo Chukwu, Big data analytics for data-driven industry: a review of data sources, tools, challenges, solutions, and research directions, Cluster Computing, 25, 5, pp. 3343-3387, (2022); Walker, Justice Toshiba, Coding Like a Data Miner: A Sandbox Approach to Computing-Based Data Science for High School Student Learning, Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE, (2023); Support K 12 Computer Science Education in Pennsylvania, (2021); Proctor, Chris, Defining and designing computer science education in a K12 public school district, pp. 314-320, (2019); Chatterji, Aaron K., Innovation and American K-12 education, Innovation Policy and the Economy, 18, pp. 27-51, (2018); Oleson, Alannah, On the Role of Design in K-12 Computing Education, ACM Transactions on Computing Education, 21, 1, (2021); Kafai, Yasmin B., From theory bias to theory dialogue: Embracing cognitive, situated, and critical framings of computational thinking in K-12 Cs education, ACM Inroads, 11, 1, pp. 44-53, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15394565","9781424447152; 0780356438; 9781538611739; 9780780390775; 0780379616; 0780314824; 9780780308329; 9781509059195; 0780390776; 1424410843","PFECD","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000694499"

This research is grounded in the implementation of ChatGPT in a data analysis course, aiming to evaluate its effectiveness in fostering students' analytical and decision-making capabilities. The study employs a qualitative methodology to assess the educational outcomes of integrating ChatGPT, focusing on its impact on student engagement, learning efficiency, and the development of critical thinking skills in the context of data science. Through a combination of interviews, and analysis of students' project outcomes, we gather insights into the challenges and opportunities presented using genAI in the data science course. A notable innovation of our approach is the introduction of a dual-report assessment method, which not only evaluates the students' project results but also their proficiency in prompt engineering - a crucial skill for effective interaction with genAI tools. Our findings suggest that while students demonstrate enhanced data analysis skills, they also face difficulties in accurately framing queries to yield useful results from genAI, highlighting an essential area for further curriculum development. Further-more, the work delves into the pedagogical strategies that can optimize the benefits of genAI tools in education. It emphasizes the importance of a structured framework that guides students in the ethical use of genAI, encourages critical reflection on AI-generated content, and fosters a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms and their implications for data science. The implications of this research extend beyond the classroom, offering valuable insights for instructors, curriculum developers, and policymakers on integrating AI technologies into educational practices. By providing a comprehensive overview of the benefits and challenges associated with the use of ChatGPT in data science education, this paper contributes to the ongoing dialogue on preparing students for a future where genAI might a significant role. In conclusion, this work highlights the potential of genAI to revolutionize data science education by enhancing analytical skills and decision-making capabilities. Continued exploration of effective strategies for integrating AI tools into learning environments, such as data science, is required to ensure that students are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complexities of genAI for future employment.","Computer Engineering; Data Science; Education; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Student Experience; Adversarial Machine Learning; Students; Artificial Intelligence Tools; Computer Engineering; Decisions Makings; Generative Artificial Intelligence; In-depth Analysis; Innovative Practices; Science Course; Science Education; Student Experiences; Student Project; Data Science","Adversarial machine learning; Students; Artificial intelligence tools; Computer engineering; Decisions makings; Generative artificial intelligence; In-depth analysis; Innovative practices; Science course; Science education; Student experiences; Student project; Data Science","","Introducing Chatgpt, (2023); Su, Jiahong, Unlocking the Power of ChatGPT: A Framework for Applying Generative AI in Education, ECNU Review of Education, 6, 3, pp. 355-366, (2023); Denny, Paul C., Computing Education in the Era of Generative AI, Communications of the ACM, 67, 2, pp. 56-67, (2024); Chan, Cecilia Ka Yuk, Students’ voices on generative AI: perceptions, benefits, and challenges in higher education, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 20, 1, (2023); Journal of Electronic Business Digital Economics, (2023); Daun, Marian, How ChatGPT Will Change Software Engineering Education, Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE, 1, pp. 110-116, (2023); Ahmad, Aakash, Towards Human-Bot Collaborative Software Architecting with ChatGPT, pp. 279-285, (2023); Ouh, Eng Lieh, ChatGPT, Can You Generate Solutions for my Coding Exercises?

With its roots in statistical analysis and later implemented as data analytics, Data Science emerged as a widely accepted discipline. The data science life cycle begins by setting a goal and ends with reporting/reflecting on the gained results. It incorporates known analytical techniques, including modern artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. While often considered an independent discipline, both engineering and liberal arts colleges have recognized the need for an understanding of data science in the general workforce. The literature still suggests a disconnect between the study fields and how the Internet of Things could be leveraged in Project-Based Learning (PBL) style data science education.

In this study, we ascertained the impact of data science and AI education on learners’ motivation and career development by analyzing a lecture-style course offered as part of mathematical and data science education at Tokyo City University, Japan. The course analyzed was Data Science Literacy 1 (DS1). The analysis period spanned three academic years, from 2020 to 2022. The analyzed items were three motivational factors derived from expectancy-value theory, namely intrinsic value, attainment utility value, and expectations for success. A fourth factor, career development, was also analyzed. We collected data pertaining to the four factors, that is, the three above mentioned motivational factors and career development, through questionnaires administered to DS1 learners. Regarding data analysis, learners were clas-sified according to the values (high vs. low) they reported for each of the four factors of interest at the beginning of the course. These were compared to the values reported at the end of the course. Results showed increases in all the motivation factors. The increasing trend was particularly pronounced among learners who initially reported low values. Although trends differed from year to year, the results suggest that data science and AI education can positively impact motivational factors and related career development.","Career Development; Data Science And Ai Education; Expectancy-value Theory; Motivation; Questionnaire Survey","","Acknowledgments.

At the same time, philosophers of science face the challenge of making their expertise accessible for scientists in such a way that it can improve everyday research practice. Here, we investigate the possibility of approaching these challenges together. In current and proposed approaches to biomedical data science education, we identify a dominant focus on only one aspect of conducting scientific research: understanding and using data, research methods, and statistical methods. We argue that this approach cannot solve biomedical data science’s challenge and we propose to shift the focus to four other aspects of conducting research: making and justifying decisions in research design and implementation, explaining their epistemic and non-epistemic effects, balancing varying responsibilities, and reporting scientific research. Attending to these aspects requires learning on different dimensions than solely learning to apply techniques (first dimension). It also requires learning to make choices (second dimension) and to understand the rationale behind choices (third dimension). This could be fostered by integrating philosophical training in biomedical data science education. Furthermore, philosophical training fosters a fourth dimension of learning, namely, understanding the nature of science. In this article, we explain how we identified the five aspects of conducting research and the four dimensions of learning, and why attending to the fourth dimension is essential. We discuss educational approaches to attend to all aspects and dimensions, and present initial design principles to implement these approaches.","","","This study was funded by Utrecht University.","Fraser, Barry J., Second International Handbook of Science Education, pp. 1-1564, (2012); Abd-El-Khalick, Fouad, Improving science teachers’ conceptions of nature of science: A critical review of the literature, International Journal of Science Education, 22, 7, pp. 665-701, (2000); Annu Rev Biomed Data Sci, (2018); Attwood, Teresa K., A global perspective on evolving bioinformatics and data science training needs, Briefings in Bioinformatics, 20, 2, pp. 398-404, (2019); Atwood, Teresa K., GOBLET: The Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training, PLOS Computational Biology, 11, 4, (2015); Benchimol, Eric I., The REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected health Data (RECORD) Statement, PLOS Medicine, 12, 10, (2015); Boniolo, Giovanni, Life Sciences for Philosophers and Philosophy for Life Scientists: What Should We Teach?, Biological Theory, 15, 1, pp. 1-11, (2020); Philosophy of Biology A Companion for Educators, (2013); Achieving Scientific Literacy from Purposes to Practices, (1997); Corpas, Manuel, The GOBLET training portal: A global repository of bioinformatics training materials, courses and trainers, Bioinformatics, 31, 1, pp. 140-142, (2015)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","09267220","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135136431"

However, in conventional education systems, computing & quantitative, and communication skills are often taught in different disciplines. Data storytelling is constructing and presenting data stories to highlight the analytical insights to achieve the communication goals to a specific audience. Digital data storytelling leverages digital storytelling techniques and best practices in communication to deliver stories that can be shared in digital formats to a wide audience. In this paper, we describe and reflect on a semester-long project-based learning pilot using Digital Storytelling as a framework to allow students to explore topics themed around human flourishing and sustainability with the end goal of constructing data stories delivered in digital or video format (i.e., Digital Data Storytelling). The pilot work was conducted in an introductory data science course at a 4-year Minority Serving Institution in collaboration with students studying non-STEM disciplines at a partner community college. Our pilot demonstrates the potential benefit of this sustainability-aware Project-Based Learning design in raising students’ awareness of sustainability issues, increasing confidence in cross-disciplinary communication competency, and at the same time deepening their understanding of data science concepts. We further reflect on the significant role of an effective program model as well as challenges and opportunities for building transdisciplinary communication competency to prepare for a diverse data science workforce.","Communication Competency; Data Science Education; Data Storytelling; Digital Storytelling; Transdisciplinary Collaboration","","This material is based upon work supported by the US National Science Foundation under Grant No. #1915714 and #2302795.","Harvard Data Science Review, (2021); Allen, Deborah E., Problem-based learning, New Directions for Teaching and Learning, 128, pp. 21-29, (2011); Allen, Genevera I., Experiential Learning in Data Science: Developing an Interdisciplinary, Client-Sponsored Capstone Program, pp. 516-522, (2021); Hans Rosling S 200 Countries 200 Years 4 Minutes the Joy of Stats Bbc Four, (2010); Data Storytelling Studio Climate Change, (2017); Bietti, Lucas M., Storytelling as Adaptive Collective Sensemaking, Topics in Cognitive Science, 11, 4, pp. 710-732, (2019); Food Studies, (2015); Braun, Virginia, Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Roundtable on Data Science Postsecondary Education A Compilation of Meeting Highlights, (2020); Journal of International Education Research, (2017)","","Aalborg University press","22460918","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174483626"

We contend that this macroethics is most appropriately developed through a holistic, human-centered data science (HCDS)-based pedagogy that concentrates on cultivating communities of ethical practice (COEPs) through social learning. We favor embedding this macroethics throughout iField programs' graduate data science curricula and by extension, the entire data science education enterprise.

Over three academic terms, the author mandated these tools across courses in R, Python, C++, SQL, and more. The onboarding relied on simplified Emacs tutorials and starter configurations. Students gained proficiency after undertaking initial practice. Live coding sessions demonstrated the flexible instruction enabled by literate notebooks. Assignments and projects required documentation alongside functional code. Student feedback showed enthusiasm for learning a versatile IDE, despite some frustration with the learning curve. Skilled students highlighted efficiency gains in a unified environment. However, the uneven adoption of documentation practices pointed to a need for better incorporation into grading. Additionally, some students found Emacs unintuitive, desiring more accessible options. This highlights a need to match tools to skill levels, potentially starting novices with graphical IDEs before introducing Emacs. The key takeaways are as follows: literate programming aids comprehension but requires rigorous onboarding and reinforcement, and Emacs excels for advanced workflows but has a steep initial curve. With proper support, these tools show promise for data science education.","Case Study; Data Science; Emacs; Ide; Literate Programming; Org-mode; Teaching","","","Gnu Emacs Manual, (1986); Knuth, Donald E., LITERATE PROGRAMMING., Computer Journal, 27, 2, pp. 97-111, (1984); Kluyver, Thomas A., Jupyter Notebooks—a publishing format for reproducible computational workflows, pp. 87-90, (2016); Dumontier, Michel J., Data Science - Methods, infrastructure, and applications, Data Science, 1, 1-2, pp. 1-5, (2017); Proceedings of the Eadtuthe Online Open and Flexible Higher Education Conference; Emacsconf 2021 Using Org Mode to Teach Programmingdaniel German; Johnson, Timothy, Emacs as a Tool for Modern Science The use of open source tools to improve scientific workflows, Johnson Matthey Technology Review, 66, 2, pp. 122-129, (2022); undefined; undefined; undefined","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","26736470","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177586098"

In collaboration with 17 experts, selected through purposive sampling, and involving 100 instructors within Sichuan, China, this research explores an instructional model designed to foster self-regulated learning in the field of data science. The Delphi data collection method is employed to investigate the relevance of various learning theories within international higher education in Sichuan Province, China, with a specific emphasis on the data science discipline. The Self-Regulated Learning in International Higher Education (SLR-IHE) model, informed by survey questionnaires, addresses pertinent challenges encountered in data science education, including issues related to English language proficiency, faculty training, curriculum development, faculty mobility, cross-border regulations, and funding constraints. The findings of this study lead to the development of an International Higher Education (IHE) Model for Sichuan Province, China, using the Delphi Technique, which consists of four distinct instructional modules. Through a linear regression analysis of the SLR-IHE model, it becomes evident that the self-regulated learning process in data science education comprises four essential stages, each contributing to the acquisition of distinct goals. These stages include: (1) activating prior knowledge; (2) fostering idea exchange and iterative improvement; (3) building organizational knowledge through understanding, memorization, analysis, and transfer; and (4) generating innovative ideas through reflexive thinking and initiating creative thought processes. These stages collectively support the achievement of specific goals associated with Self-Managed Learning (SML), Self-Regulated Learning (SRL), Self-Paced Learning (SPL), and Self-Directed Learning (SDL) in the context of data science education. This comprehensive instructional model for data science education within the framework of international higher education development in Sichuan Province, China, emphasizes globalization, collaborative efforts, and economic growth as key drivers for enhancing the quality of education in the field of data science.","Delphi Technique; Educational Research; Learning Strategies; Model Development; Self-regulated Learning","","","De Wit, Hans, Globalisation and internationalisation of higher education, RUSC Universities and Knowledge Society Journal, 8, 2, pp. 241-248, (2011); Knight, Jane, Internationalization Remodeled: Definition, Approaches, and Rationales, Journal of Studies in International Education, 8, 1, pp. 5-31, (2004); Li, Jian, New directions towards internationalization of higher education in China during post-COVID 19: A systematic literature review, Educational Philosophy and Theory, 54, 6, pp. 812-821, (2022); Wu, Hantian, Three dimensions of China’s “outward-oriented” higher education internationalization, Higher Education, 77, 1, pp. 81-96, (2019); Tong, Fuhui, Examining cross-cultural transferability of self-regulated learning model: an adaptation of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire for Chinese adult learners, Educational Studies, 46, 4, pp. 422-439, (2020); Schunk, Dale H., Toward a Conceptual Model of Mentoring Research: Integration with Self-Regulated Learning, Educational Psychology Review, 25, 3, pp. 361-389, (2013); Comprehensive Internationalization from Concept to Action, (2011); Altbach, Philip G., The internationalization of higher education: Motivations and realities, Journal of Studies in International Education, 11, 3-4, pp. 290-305, (2007); Marginson, Simon, Higher education in the global knowledge economy, Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 2, 5, pp. 6962-6980, (2010); Chennamsetti, Prashanti, Challenges Faced by Indian International Students in US Higher Education, Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies in Education, 9, 2, pp. 249-263, (2020)","","Bright Publisher","27236471","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171681710"

As a consequence, the spectrum of data science education programs has increased significantly in recent years, and there is a high demand for data scientists at many companies. However, what training is required to become a data scientist? What is the role of data scientists in current enterprises? Is the training well-aligned to the practical needs of a job? In this article, we will address these questions by evaluating a survey of people who were trained in a continuing education program in data science in Switzerland. Our study sheds lights on the practical aspects of the data science education and how this newly-gained knowledge can successfully be applied in an enterprise. One of the highlights from the point of view of the database community is the important role of SQL in data science.","Data Science; Data Science Education; Data Science Methods; 'current; Continuing Education; Data Science Education; Data Science Method; Education Programmes; High Demand; Science Education; Science Methods; Spectra's; Switzerland; Data Science","'current; Continuing education; Data science education; Data science method; Education programmes; High demand; Science education; Science methods; Spectra's; Switzerland; Data Science","","Baškarada, Saša, Unicorn data scientist: the rarest of breeds, Program, 51, 1, pp. 65-74, (2017); Braschler, Martin, Applied Data Science: Lessons Learned for the Data-Driven Business, pp. 1-465, (2019); Davenport, Thomas H., Data scientist: The sexiest job of the 21st century, Harvard Business Review, 90, 10, (2012); Klee, Sven, How Data Analytics Competencies Can Foster Business Value– A Systematic Review and Way Forward, Information Systems Management, 38, 3, pp. 200-217, (2021); Why an Ai Researcher Shouldn T Be Your First Data Science Hire, (2022); Mikalef, Patrick, The human side of big data: Understanding the skills of the data scientist in education and industry, IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON, 2018-April, pp. 503-512, (2018); Mikalef, Patrick, Investigating the data science skill gap: An empirical analysis, IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON, April-2019, pp. 1275-1284, (2019); How to Become A Data Scientist A Guide to the Education Skills and Necessary Experience, (2022); Big Data, (2016)","","Association for Computing Machinery","01635808","9780897915922; 9780897911283; 0897911288; 0897915925","SRECD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168795466"

A digital divide separates scientists who accelerate their science using large cyberinfrastructure from those who do not, or who do not have access to the compute resources or learning opportunities to develop the skills needed. The exclusionary nature of the digital divide threatens equity and the future of innovation by leaving people out of the scientific process while over-amplifying the voices of a small group who have resources. However, there are potential solutions: recent advancements in public research cyberinfrastructure and resources developed during the open science revolution are providing tools that can help bridge this divide. These tools can enable access to fast and powerful computation with modest internet connections and personal computers. Here we contribute another resource for narrowing the digital divide: scalable virtual machines running on public cloud infrastructure. We describe the tools, infrastructure, and methods that enabled successful deployment of a reproducible and scalable cyberinfrastructure architecture for a collaborative data synthesis working group in February 2023. This platform enabled 45 scientists with varying data and compute skills to leverage 40,000 hours of compute time over a 4-day workshop. Our approach provides an open framework that can be replicated for educational and collaborative data synthesis experiences in any data- and compute-intensive discipline.","Cyberinfrastructure; Digital Equity; Open Science; Team Science; E-learning; Open Data; Cyberinfrastructure; Data Synthesis; Digital Divide; Digital Equity; Environmental Data; Modern Science; Open Science; Public Research; Science Education; Team Science; Personal Computers","E-learning; Open Data; Cyberinfrastructure; Data synthesis; Digital divide; Digital equity; Environmental data; Modern science; Open science; Public research; Science education; Team science; Personal computers","Funding text 1: The working group was supported by the Environmental Data Synthesis Innovation and Inclusion Lab (ESIIL, NSF award DBI-2153040) and additional NSF grants DEB-2017889 and DEB-1846384.

Over the next several decades, the world's reliance on cloud computing and big data will continuously increase, and new data-centric technologies and engineering approaches will be developed. Due to this rapidly developing field, there is a need to track these trends and incorporate the corresponding developments into our current science and engineering curriculum. Besides data science skills already taught in traditional engineering curricula, such as mathematical, computational, and statistical foundations, the National Academies guide discusses that key concepts in developing data acumen include domain-specific considerations and ethical problem-solving. This work-in-progress (WIP) paper will highlight the foundation of a comprehensive study to explore data science education in two domain-specific programs: material science and engineering and architectural engineering. This project is broken down into the following objectives: 1) facilitate data science education and workforce development for engineering and related topics, 2) provide opportunities for students to participate in practical experiences where they can learn new skills through opportunities in new settings to transform data science education, and 3) expand the data science talent pool by enabling the participation of undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds, experiences, skills, and technical maturity.

Although the representational forms chosen by students were mainly traditional, our findings indicate that they were engaged in authentic data visualization practices throughout their programming process. These practices included translating ideas into programs, selecting parameters (such as color scheme and space between data points), inspecting the output, and adding annotations to provide context and better communicate the desired information. Moreover, our analysis pointed out opportunities for improving PlayData, mainly by the addition of new primitives for automating labeling and performing data transformations.","Block-based Programming Environments; Computational Thinking; Data Science Education; Data Visualization; Program Translators; Visualization; Block Based; Block-based Programming Environment; Colour Spaces; Computational Thinkings; Data Science Education; Educational Tools; Entry Point; Programming Environment; Programming Process; Science Education; Data Visualization","Program translators; Visualization; Block based; Block-based programming environment; Colour spaces; Computational thinkings; Data science education; Educational tools; Entry point; Programming environment; Programming process; Science education; Data visualization","This work was partially supported by the grants Projeto Ciência na Escola (441066/2019-4 CNPq), and Projeto ProEduca (Processo FAPESP n° 2022/06977-5).","K 12 Computer Science Framework, (2016); Aivaloglou, Efthimia, How kids code and how we know: An exploratory study on the scratch repository, pp. 53-61, (2016); Atherton, Jack, Sonification blocks: A block-based programming environment for embodied data Sonification, pp. 733-736, (2017); Bako, Hannah K., Understanding how Designers Find and Use Data Visualization Examples, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 29, 1, pp. 1048-1058, (2023); Pre K 12 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education II Gaise II, (2020); Berland, Matthew W., Using Learning Analytics to Understand the Learning Pathways of Novice Programmers, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 22, 4, pp. 564-599, (2013); Bertling, Joy G., The Case for Data Visualization in the Art Classroom, Art Education, 74, 2, pp. 44-49, (2021); Bevan, Bronwyn, Learning Through STEM-Rich Tinkering: Findings From a Jointly Negotiated Research Project Taken Up in Practice, Science Education, 99, 1, pp. 98-120, (2015); Data Science K 10 Big Ideas, (2025); Börner, Katy, Data visualization literacy: Definitions, conceptual frameworks, exercises, and assessments, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 116, 6, pp. 1857-1864, (2019)","","Association for Computing Machinery","","9798400707360; 9798400702013","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163734914"

For youth growing up in an increasingly data-driven society, it is critical they have foundational data literacy skills. A central component of data literacy is the ability to collect, analyze, visualize, and make meaning from data. All of these activities are mediated and shaped by the tools that youth use to carry out these data practices. Given the essential role tools play in enabling and supporting youth in engaging with and interpreting data, understanding what tools are used and how they are used in educational contexts will help us understand how youth are being prepared to be data-literate citizens. In this paper, we present the analysis of the data collection and analysis tools used in 4 widely adopted high school data science curricula. The analysis attends to both what tools are used as well as what datasets they are used to analyze. This work contributes to our understanding of the way youth are being introduced to concepts and practices from the field of data science and the role the tools play in shaping those experiences.","Data Analysis Tools; Data Science Education; Youth; Central Component; Data Analysis Tool; Data Collection Tools; Data Driven; Data Practices; Data Science Education; Data Understanding; Educational Context; Science Education; Youth; Data Science","Central component; Data analysis tool; Data collection tools; Data driven; Data practices; Data science education; Data understanding; Educational context; Science education; Youth; Data Science","This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant #2141655.

In this paper, we discuss the centrality of API (application programming interface) lookup to data wran-gling, and how an ontology-structured command menu could facilitate it. We design thumbnail graphics as visual alternatives to explaining data wrangling operations and use a survey to validate their quality. We furthermore predict that thumbnail graphics make the menu more navigable, improving lookup e_ciency and performance. Our predictions are tested using Slice N Dice, an online data wrangling tutorial platform that collects learner activity. It includes both non-programmatic and programmatic data wrangling exercises. Participants from a multi-institutional sample (n=200) were randomly assigned the tutorial either with or without thumbnail graphics. Our results show that thumbnail graphics reduce the need for clari_cations, thereby assisting API lookup for novices learning data wrangling. We further present some negative results regarding performance gain and follow up with a discussion on why the di_erences are subtle and how they can be improved. Last but not least, we complement our statistical results with a qualitative study where we receive positive feedback from our participants on the design and helpfulness of the thumbnail graphics.","Data Preparation; Data Science Education; Data Wrangling; Numpy; Pandas; R","","Acknowledgments.

Further, the increased availability of large-scale electronically accessible data sets is an untapped area of study. This interpretive study examined middle school students' understanding of statistical concepts involved in making a plan to collect data to answer a statistical question within a social issue context using data available on the internet. Student artifacts, researcher notes, and audio and video recordings from nine groups of 20 seventh-grade students in two gifted education pull-out classes at a suburban middle school were used to answer the study research questions. Data were analyzed using a priori codes from previously developed frameworks and by using an inductive approach to find themes. Three themes that emerged from data related to confirmation bias. Some middle school students held preconceptions about the social issues they chose to study that biased their statistical questions. This in turn inuenced the sources of data students used to answer their questions. Confirmation bias is a serious issue that is exacerbated due to endless sources of data electronically available. We argue that this type of bias should be addressed early in students' educational experiences.

This study aims to develop a data science graduate curriculum model from an information science perspective to support iField schools in developing data science graduate education. In June 2020, information about 96 data science graduate programs from iField schools worldwide was collected and analyzed using a mixed research method based on inductive content analysis. A wide range of data science competencies and skills development and 12 knowledge topics covered by the curriculum were obtained. The humanistic model is further taken as the theoretical and methodological basis for course model construction, and 12 course knowledge topics are reconstructed into 4 course modules, including (a) data-driven methods and techniques; (b) domain knowledge; (c) legal, moral, and ethical aspects of data; and (d) shaping and developing personal traits, and human-centered data science graduate curriculum model is formed. At the end of the study, the wide application prospect of this model is discussed.","Data Science; Domain Knowledge; Competency Development; Content Analysis; Curricula Models; Graduate Curriculum; Graduate Education; Graduate Programme; Modeling Designs; Research Method; Science Education; Science Graduates; Curricula; Article; Content Analysis; Curriculum; Data Science; Ethics; Graduate Education; Human; Human Experiment; Information Science; Morality; Skill; Theoretical Study","Data Science; Domain Knowledge; Competency development; Content analysis; Curricula models; Graduate curriculum; Graduate education; Graduate programme; Modeling designs; Research method; Science education; Science graduates; Curricula; article; content analysis; curriculum; data science; ethics; graduate education; human; human experiment; information science; morality; skill; theoretical study","This study was supported by the Hubei Provincial Teaching Research Project (No. 2020033) and 2021 Wuhan University Undergraduate Education Quality Construction Comprehensive Reform Project.","Adams, Joel C., Creating a balanced data science program, pp. 185-191, (2020); Anderson, Paul E., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, pp. 145-150, (2014); undefined, (2014); Barison, Maria Bernardete, The competencies of BIM specialists: A comparative analysis of the literature review and job Ad descriptions, Congress on Computing in Civil Engineering, Proceedings, pp. 594-602, (2011); Berman, Francine, Realizing the potential of data science, Communications of the ACM, 61, 4, pp. 67-72, (2018); Journal of Library and Information Science Taipei, (2011); Notes from the AI Frontier Tackling Europe S Gap in Digital and AI, (2019); Chen, Hsinliang, Educating Data Management Professionals: A Content Analysis of Job Descriptions, Journal of Academic Librarianship, 43, 1, pp. 18-24, (2017); Danyluk, Andrea Pohoreckyj, ACM task force on data science education draft report and opportunity for feedback, pp. 496-497, (2019); Danyluk, Andrea Pohoreckyj, Computing Competencies for Undergraduate Data Science Programs: An ACM Task Force Final Report, pp. 1119-1120, (2021)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","23301643; 23301635","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127253136"

The iFields' emphasis on knowledge organization and representation provides insight into how data, used by scientists, are used to create knowledge. The iFields' disciplinary emphasis also encompasses the sociotechnical complexity of dilemmas that we found arise in research data management.

This article seeks to build on existing literature concerned with the sociopolitical, cultural, and ethical dimensions of data science education by considering the salience of two interrelated concepts discussed in Asian and Asian American studies and postcolonial studies: techno-Orientalism and the Filipino mimicry stereotype. These concepts describe the positioning of Asians and Asian Americans, and Filipinos in particular, as performance machines who are adept at copying the ideas of dominant groups but incapable of innovation themselves. This article situates techno-Orientalism and the Filipino mimicry stereotype within broader conversations around postcolonial data politics and then argues for the possibility of including these concepts in data science education curricula.

The move is prompted by research that shows data science is a great tool to broaden participation in CS because it offers students an opportunity to apply their computing knowledge to socially relevant problems. Broadening participation, particularly among underrepresented students, is critical to the future health and stability of the field. However, data science is still a relatively new in the context of K-12 schools and few CS teachers are pedagogically trained in data science. In order to test whether or not data science can be a tool to increase student representation in CS and help schools implement more data science curriculum, our project partnered with a local school district to modify an existing data science unit.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to reveal the reality of data science education in the Middle East and to determine the opportunities and challenges for teaching data science in the region. Thirteen countries in the Middle East were offering 48 data science programmes at the time of the study. The results reveal that these data science programmes significantly use the words ‘data’ and ‘analytics’ in their names. With regard to the academic affiliations of the data science programmes, the study found that they are offered in a variety of schools, especially computer science, information technology and business. Moreover, the study found that computer science is the dominant trend in the programmes. Data science programmes have a significant overlap with other programmes, especially statistics and computer science, because of the interdisciplinary nature of this field. Data science schools in the Middle East differ in terms of their programme titles, programme descriptions, course catalogues, curriculum structures and course objectives. Broadly, this study may be useful for those who are seeking to establish a data science programme or to strengthen data science curricula at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.","Arabian Gulf Countries; Curriculum Analysis; Data Analytics; Data Science; Data Science Education; Middle East","","","Aasheim, Cheryl L., Data analytics vs. data science: A study of similarities and differences in undergraduate programs based on course descriptions, Journal of Information Systems Education, 26, 2, pp. 103-115, (2015); Master of Science in Business Analytics, (2022); Agarwal, Ritu, Big data, data science, and analytics: The opportunity and challenge for IS research, Information Systems Research, 25, 3, pp. 443-448, (2014); Ahmad, Khurshid, An analysis of academic librarians competencies and skills for implementation of Big Data analytics in libraries: A correlational study, Data Technologies and Applications, 53, 2, pp. 201-216, (2019); Bachelor Degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, (2022); undefined, (2019); An Introduction to Computers in Information Science, (1968); Barlas, Panagiotis, A survey of open source data science tools, International Journal of Intelligent Computing and Cybernetics, 8, 3, pp. 232-261, (2015); Bennett, Tellen D., Data Science for Child Health, Journal of Pediatrics, 208, pp. 12-22, (2019); Revolution in Astronomy Education Data Science for the Masses, (2009)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","03400352; 17452651","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135498894"

In this exploratory study, we aimed to understand (a) what apt epistemic processes within data literacy look like in practice with children, and (b) to what extent a curriculum built on a simulation-based data analysis intervention (where students engage in experimentation and data analyses through the use of simulations) promotes the epistemic processes of data literacy. We used the Apt-AIR framework, which expounds on the components needed for successful epistemic education, as a tool to identify students’ apt epistemic processes. The results illustrate that elementary students were able to activate cognitive, emotional, and—to a lesser extent—metacognitive and collaborative epistemic processes related to data literacy skills in this context. Additionally, the design features embedded in the experimentation lesson were more successful in engaging students in apt epistemic processes; yet the data analysis lesson, while engaging students in fewer processes overall, was successful in promoting students’ ability to make accurate inferences using an aggregate view of data. We discuss the trends in the apt epistemic processes related to data literacy that emerged and their implications for instruction and learning.","Apt-air Framework; Data Science Education; Informal Statistical Inference; Simulations","","Funding text 1: This research was largely funded by the National Science Foundation, grant number 1513043, and, in part, by the Litzsinger Road Ecology Foundation.

The primary aim of the study was to understand how DSE may be scaled to non-science participants, particularly using immersive DSE training sessions that culminated in a datathon (data science hackathon). The immersion programme was based on a project-based pedagogy informed by the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) to integrate data science's multidisciplinary nature. Quantitative research was used with 107 datathon participants. Using various statistical measures including Exploratory Factor Analysis, the key results revealed that non-science participants who completed the immersions and datathon were sufficiently knowledgeable in all the CRISP-DM components as well as those who attended the full DSE programme. This means data science skills can be attained by non-STEM individuals by spending focused time in immersions on a specific data science concept. In this case, immersion sped up learning as the participants picked up new data science concepts while applying them simultaneously. The study recommends immersions through datathons to encourage transdisciplinary collaborative learning to massify data science skills.","Crisp-dm; Data Science Education; Datathon; Pedagogy; Transdisciplinary; Data Science; Decision Making; Factor Analysis; Information Systems; Information Use; Cross Industry; Cross Industry Standard Process For Data Mining; Data Science Education; Datathon; Immersive; Industry Standards; Pedagogy; Science Education; Standards Process; Transdisciplinary; Data Mining","Data Science; Decision making; Factor analysis; Information systems; Information use; Cross industry; Cross industry standard process for data mining; Data science education; Datathon; Immersive; Industry standards; Pedagogy; Science education; Standards process; Transdisciplinary; Data mining","","Anslow, Craig, Datathons: An experience report of data hackathons for data science education, pp. 615-620, (2016); Baier, Lucas, Challenges in the deployment and operation of machine learning in practice, (2020); Cao, Longbing, Data Science: Profession and Education, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 34, 5, pp. 35-44, (2019); Cetinkaya-Rundel, Mine, A Fresh Look at Introductory Data Science, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 29, S1, pp. S16-S26, (2021); Chen, Xieling, Detecting latent topics and trends in educational technologies over four decades using structural topic modeling: A retrospective of all volumes of Computers & Education, Computers and Education, 151, (2020); Dill-McFarland, Kimberly A., An integrated, modular approach to data science education in microbiology, PLOS Computational Biology, 17, 2, (2021); Farahi, Arya, The Michigan Data Science Team: A Data Science Education Program with Significant Social Impact, pp. 120-124, (2018); Garmire, Lana Xia, The training of next generation data scientists in biomedicine, Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, 0, 212679, pp. 640-645, (2017); Huppenkothen, Daniela, Hack weeks as a model for data science education and collaboration, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 115, 36, pp. 8872-8877, (2018); Jaggia, Sanjiv, Applying the CRISP-DM Framework for Teaching Business Analytics, Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education, 18, 4, pp. 612-634, (2020)","","Association for Information Systems","","9781713893592","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192871749"

However, there are two issues with this approach: (1) it is very costly to prepare multiple real-world problems (using real data) according to the learning objectives, and (2) the learner must suddenly tackle complex real-world problems immediately after learning from a textbook using ideal data. To solve these issues, this paper proposes data science teaching material that uses agent-based simulation (ABS). The proposed teaching material consists of an ABS model and an ABS story. To solve issue 1, the scenario of the problem can be changed according to the learning objectives by setting the appropriate parameters of the ABS model. To solve issue 2, the difficulty level of the tasks can be adjusted by changing the description in the ABS story. We show that, by using this teaching material, the learner can simulate the typical tasks performed by a data scientist in a step-by-step manner (causal inference, data understanding, hypothesis building, data collection, data wrangling, data analysis, and hypothesis testing). The teaching material described in this paper focuses on causal inference as the learning objectives and infectious diseases as the model theme for ABS, but ABS is used as a model to reproduce many types of social phenomena, and its range of expression is extremely wide. Therefore, we expect that the proposed teaching material will inspire the construction of teaching material for various objectives in data science education.","Agent-based Simulation; Causal Inference; Covid-19; Data Science Education; Data Acquisition; Data Science; Learning Systems; Agent Based Simulation; Agent-based Simulation Models; Causal Inferences; Data Science Education; Data Understanding; Learning Objectives; Real-world Problem; Science Education; Science Teaching; Teaching Materials; Covid-19","Data acquisition; Data Science; Learning systems; Agent based simulation; Agent-based simulation models; Causal inferences; Data science education; Data understanding; Learning objectives; Real-world problem; Science education; Science teaching; Teaching materials; COVID-19","ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Edanz (https://jp.edanz.com/ac) for editing a draft of this manuscript.

It is vital to ensure that all students have access to the necessary learning resources. While gender bias in STEM has received significant attention, research on racial bias is relatively limited, and the combined effects of gender and racial biases in Data Science remain largely unexplored. The objective of this study is to investigate these biases in Data Science education by examining the preferences of 300 diverse students enrolled in Data Science related classes, with a specific focus on their preferences regarding teaching practices and methods. The impact of race and gender in Data Science education is an important area of study that has gained increased attention in recent years. Race and gender play a critical role in representation within the Data Science community. Stereotypes and biases can influence the experiences of individuals from different racial and gender backgrounds within Data Science education. Race and gender can impact data science pedagogy in various ways, influencing instructional practices, content delivery, and student experiences. Using machine learning techniques to understand biased pedagogy in data science education can be a valuable approach to uncover patterns and insights. We propose an effective unsupervised learning approach to examine the correlations between preferred pedagogical methods and gender-racial background of the participating students. Our findings show that student's gender has a significant correlation with learning style; e.g., female students prefer more private methods of interaction with TAs and instructors, such as anonymous polls and Zoom meetings. Furthermore, our study uncovers significant associations between race, gender, and learning styles, showing that Asian students exhibit higher levels of Classroom Interaction and Group Assignment Preference than their White counterparts. These findings are crucial for Data Science educators seeking to identify and address racial and gender biases, promoting a more inclusive and equitable learning environment, especially for underrepresented minorities. Recognizing these influences enables educators to implement targeted strategies for a supportive and engaging educational experience for all students.","Association Reactions; Computer Aided Instruction; Data Science; Learning Systems; Combined Effect; Gender Bias; Gender Equity; Government Initiatives; Learning Resource; Learningstyles; Racial Bias; Science Education; Stem Fields; Teaching Practices; Students","Association reactions; Computer aided instruction; Data Science; Learning systems; Combined effect; Gender bias; Gender equity; Government initiatives; Learning resource; Learningstyles; Racial bias; Science education; STEM fields; Teaching practices; Students","","Argyriou, Paraskevi, What to Blend?

In response, there has been growing attention in research and practice emphasizing pre-college groups. This is partly because of the growing recognition-reflected in initiatives like CS4ALL, Code.org, Bootstrap: Data Science, Exploring Computer Science-that learning experiences before college are consequential in sustaining a robust pipeline of computer scientists and engineers. Despite these inroads, there is justifiable concern that existing efforts might not fully support learner development in the necessary conceptual, epistemological, and heuristic styles needed to productively parse and understand 'big data.' This is because computing-based curricula that include data science often involve data curated by others (rather than learners directly), which results in simulated versions of practice instead of engagement that is realistically discursive and messy. This is further complicated by the persistent shortage of K-12 computer science teachers in general and even fewer who can design and implement curricula that support authentic engagement with data science. To address these issues, we leverage culturally relevant and constructionist perspectives in a sandbox (i.e., open-ended) science where tools like Scratch and electronic textiles (E-textiles) have had success expanding possibilities in computing to also include activities where learners can engage broadly along varied pursuits-and encounter challenges that spur computational thinking and problem-solving. The literature suggests that learning activities framed in this way encourage knowledge construction, practice literacies, and seriously impact learner attitudes, interest, and perceptions of growth in the field. This latter set of self-concept measures represents a few of many related key predictors of long-term field participation and persistence. In this work-in-progress scholarship of discovery research, we co-develop, with youth and educators, 'Coding Like a Data Miner' (CLDM)-a sandbox approach to computing-based data science wherein learners access a social media platform, Twitter, to mine, analyze, and understand quantitative and qualitative data sources. In this preliminary work, we assess affordances in co-developing a curriculum that leverages sandbox approaches to data science. Ultimately (and what will be presented in our final submission), we aim to study learning outcomes when high school students' access, analyze and make sense of 'big data' sets of their own. We collaborated with high school teachers in a West Texas/Paso Del Norte region where computer science educators are exceptionally scarce and where there is an urgent and persistent need to support underrepresented learner access to burgeoning areas of computing. Using mixed-methodological approaches (e.g., quantitative analysis of learner pre- and post-survey responses along with qualitative assessments of semi-structured interview data), we address the following research questions: (1) What affordances exist using co-design approaches to develop sandbox data science for pre-college learners? (2) Which computational concepts do students learn when carrying out CLDM activities, (3) Which computational practices do high school students enact when mining, processing, and analyzing big data sets in CLDM? (4) How do learner knowledge and perceptions about data science shift after participating in CLDM? We use contemporary perspectives in computing education, constructionism, and equity to discuss how open-ended sandbox approaches to computing-based data science support learner computational thinking, practice literacies, and field perceptions.","Computer Science Education; Computer Science Learning; Constructionism; Curriculum Design; Data Science Education; Digital Devices; E-learning; Education Computing; Engineering Education; Smart Textiles; Social Networking (online); Students; Computer Science Education; Computer Science Learning; Constructionism; Curricula Design; Data Miners; Data Science Education; High School Students; Pre-college; Science Education; Science Learning; Curricula","Digital devices; E-learning; Education computing; Engineering education; Smart textiles; Social networking (online); Students; Computer Science Education; Computer science learning; Constructionism; Curricula design; Data miners; Data science education; High school students; Pre-college; Science education; Science learning; Curricula","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation (#2137708).

However, it remains uncertain whether the data science programs provided by universities with different rankings deliver similar or distinct data science competencies. This study aims to compare the competencies of graduate data science programs offered in the United States. It addressed the research question of 'Are there any differences in graduate data science program competencies based on their university rankings?' The program competencies of 228 data science graduate programs as well as their U.S. News university rankings were collected and compared. The findings indicate that regardless of their national rankings, all universities offer most of the competencies required for data science programs, except for Machine Learning and Sensor Networks. Forty-six percent of data science programs are offered in universities that hold national rankings within the top 75, focusing on majors such as data science and business analytics. Furthermore, the top-ranked universities provide data science programs across all departments or schools, with the most prominent ones being Business, Computer Science, Information Science & Technology, and Math/Statistics. The primary research contribution of this study revolves around conducting a comprehensive analysis of data science program competencies within the United States. The implications of the findings have significant relevance to computing education. The study provides valuable guidelines for educational practices in the field of data science: 1) naming the new majors as either 'Data Science' or 'Business Analytics'; 2) housing the new data science programs within existing departments or schools specializing in Business, Computer Science, Information Science & Technology, and Math/Statistics; 3) incorporating all ACM Data Science competencies into the curriculum of these programs while also emphasizing the need for a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics. Overall, these implications provide valuable guidance for universities seeking to develop impactful and well-rounded data science educational offerings that align with industry demands and equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge.","Acm Competencies; Computer Science; Computing Education; Data Science Competence; Data Science Education; Graduate Education; Education Computing; Engineering Education; Students; Acm Competency; Business Analytics; Computing Education; Data Science Competence; Data Science Education; Graduate Education; Graduate Programme; Science Education; Science Projects; Science Technologies; Sensor Networks","Education computing; Engineering education; Students; ACM competency; Business analytics; Computing education; Data science competence; Data science education; Graduate education; Graduate programme; Science education; Science projects; Science technologies; Sensor networks","","Ira International Journal of Management Social Sciences, (2018); Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, (2022); Song, Il Yeol, Big Data and Data Science: Opportunities and Challenges of iSchools, Journal of Data and Information Science, 2, 3, pp. 1-18, (2017); White, John A., Core Competencies for Undergraduates in Bioengineering and Biomedical Engineering: Findings, Consequences, and Recommendations, Annals of Biomedical Engineering, 48, 3, pp. 905-912, (2020); International Journal of Data Mining Knowledge Management Process Ijdkp, (2020); Li, Duo, Content Analysis of Data Science Graduate Programs in the U.S., ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings, (2021); Overton, Michael R., Data science literacy: Toward a philosophy of accessible and adaptable data science skill development in public administration programs, Teaching Public Administration, (2021); Demchenko, Yuri S., EDISON data science framework: A foundation for building data science profession for research and industry, Proceedings of the International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science, CloudCom, 0, pp. 620-626, (2016); Leidig, Paul M., ACM Taskforce Efforts on Computing Competencies for Undergraduate Data Science Curricula, Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE, pp. 519-520, (2020); De Veaux, Richard D., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 15-30, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15394565","9781424447152; 0780356438; 9781538611739; 9780780390775; 0780379616; 0780314824; 9780780308329; 9781509059195; 0780390776; 1424410843","PFECD","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183018310"

This paper investigates the potential use of ChatGPT, a generative AI tool, in providing personalized learning experiences for data science education, specifically focusing on Deep Learning. The paper presents a case study that applies the 5Es model to test personalized learning for students using ChatGPT. The study aims to answer the question of how educators can leverage ChatGPT in their pedagogy to enhance student learning, and whether ChatGPT can provide a better learning experience than traditional teaching methods. The paper also discusses the limitations faced during the study and the findings. The results suggest that ChatGPT can be a valuable resource for data science education, providing personalized and instant feedback to learners. However, ethical considerations such as the potential for biased or inaccurate responses and the need for transparency in AI-generated content should be carefully addressed by educators. The study highlights ChatGPT’s potential as a research tool for data science educators to investigate the effectiveness of AI in personalized learning experiences. Overall, this paper contributes to the ongoing dialogue on the role of AI in data science education and provides insights into how educators can utilize ChatGPT to enhance student learning and engagement.","Chatgpt; Data Science Education; Generative Ai; Personalized Learning; Deep Learning; Education Computing; Learning Systems; Teaching; Case-studies; Chatgpt; Data Science Education; Ethical Considerations; Generative Ai; Learning Experiences; Personalized Learning; Science Education; Student Learning; Teaching Methods; Students","Deep learning; Education computing; Learning systems; Teaching; Case-studies; ChatGPT; Data science education; Ethical considerations; Generative AI; Learning experiences; Personalized learning; Science education; Student learning; Teaching methods; Students","","Autism, (2011); Ng, Tsz Kit Davy, Teachers’ AI digital competencies and twenty-first century skills in the post-pandemic world, Educational Technology Research and Development, 71, 1, pp. 137-161, (2023); Dzikovska, Myroslava O., BEETLE II: Deep natural language understanding and automatic feedback generation for intelligent tutoring in basic electricity and electronics, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 24, 3, pp. 284-332, (2014); Chen, Hsiuling, A ChatBot for Learning Chinese: Learning Achievement and Technology Acceptance, Journal of Educational Computing Research, 58, 6, pp. 1161-1189, (2020); Universitat Oberta De Catalunya, (2018); Colace, Francesco, Chatbot for e-learning: A case of study, International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics Research, 7, 5, pp. 528-533, (2018); Basham, James D., An Operationalized Understanding of Personalized Learning, Journal of Special Education Technology, 31, 3, pp. 126-136, (2016); International Association for K 12 Online Learning, (2013); Chatgpt Optimizing Language Models for Dialogue, (2022); Biswas, Som Subhro, Potential Use of Chat GPT in Global Warming, Annals of Biomedical Engineering, 51, 6, pp. 1126-1127, (2023)","","Science and Information Organization","21565570; 2158107X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179181137"

These programs focus on developing both ""classic""information science competencies as well as core data science competencies among their students. Since data science competencies are often associated with mathematical and computational thinking, departmental officials and prospective students often raise concerns regarding the appropriate background students should have in order to succeed in this newly introduced computational content of the LIS training programs. In order to address these concerns, we report on an exploratory study through which we examined the 2020 and 2021 student classes of Bar-Ilan University's LIS graduate training, focusing on the computational data science courses (i.e., supervised and unsupervised machine learning). Our study shows that contrary to many of the concerns raised, students from the humanities performed as well (and in some cases significantly better) on data science competencies compared to those from the social sciences and had better success in the training program as a whole. In addition, students' undergraduate GPA acted as an adequate indicator for both their success in the training program and in the data science part thereof. In addition, we find no evidence to support concerns regarding age or sex. Finally, our study suggests that the computational data science part of students' training is very much aligned with the rest of their training program.","Computational Data Science Training; Data Science Competencies; Data Science Education","","","Advising on Research Methods A Consultant S Companion, (2008); Agarwal, Ritu, Big data, data science, and analytics: The opportunity and challenge for IS research, Information Systems Research, 25, 3, pp. 443-448, (2014); Awan, Saqib Ejaz, Machine learning-based prediction of heart failure readmission or death: implications of choosing the right model and the right metrics, ESC Heart Failure, 6, 2, pp. 428-435, (2019); Bartschat, Andreas, Data mining tools, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 9, 4, (2019); Baumer, Benjamin S., A Data Science Course for Undergraduates: Thinking With Data, American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 334-342, (2015); Belkin, Nicholas J., Information science and the phenomenon of information, Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 27, 4, pp. 197-204, (1976); American Documentation, (1968); Bronstein, Jenny, An exploration of the library and information science professional skills and personal competencies: An Israeli perspective, Library and Information Science Research, 37, 2, pp. 130-138, (2015); Brunner, Robert J., Teaching data science, Procedia Computer Science, 80, pp. 1947-1956, (2016); Burgoyne, John Ashley, Music Information Retrieval, pp. 213-228, (2015)","","University of Toronto Press","07485786; 23282967","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178382776"

At the same time, there is increasing interest in using temporal and sequential analysis to describe and understand learner behaviour, but current work is mostly exploratory, with promising potential for educational interventions. Obtaining sequential patterns from learner data can provide insights into processes that can be missed by descriptive analytics, where the order and timing of actions make a difference. A current scenario is in practical exercises in Data Science Education where teachers cannot access the learners' development process and are therefore unable to properly assess them or provide detailed feedback. Furthermore, there are phases of data science that may not generate data records, such as setting an objective, or intermediate evaluation and reflection. The introduction of Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Github Copilot) as coding assistants has the potential to obtain such data in the form of conversation. By using learning sequence analytics on the interactions between LLM and learners, integrated with the data traces in their programming and analytics environments, we can identify and understand behavioural patterns that can be used to assess, monitor and support the learning process in Data Science Education.","Adaptive Support; Data Science Education; Large-language Models; Learning Analytics; Learning Sequences; Sequence Analysis; Data Science; Learning Systems; 'current; Adaptive Support; Data Science Education; Language Model; Large-language Model; Learning Analytic; Learning Sequences; Learning Tasks; Science Education; Sequence Analysis; Computational Linguistics","Data Science; Learning systems; 'current; Adaptive support; Data science education; Language model; Large-language model; Learning analytic; Learning sequences; Learning tasks; Science education; Sequence analysis; Computational linguistics","This work is funded by the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Education and Learning.","Handbook of Learning Analytics, (2022); Wang, Karen D., A systematic review of empirical studies using log data from open-ended learning environments to measure science and engineering practices, British Journal of Educational Technology, 54, 1, pp. 192-221, (2023); Winne, Philip H., Construct and consequential validity for learning analytics based on trace data, Computers in Human Behavior, 112, (2020); Journal of Learning Analytics, (2017); Schwab-McCoy, Aimee, Data Science in 2020: Computing, Curricula, and Challenges for the Next 10 Years, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 29, S1, pp. S40-S50, (2021); Donoghue, Thomas, Teaching Creative and Practical Data Science at Scale, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 29, S1, pp. S27-S39, (2021); Harvard Data Science Review, (2025); Nokes-Malach, Timothy J., Problem solving and human expertise, pp. 265-272, (2010); Wang, Karen D., Automating the Assessment of Problem-solving Practices Using Log Data and Data Mining Techniques, pp. 69-76, (2021); Exercise Format Editor A Multimedia Tool for the Design of Multiple Learning Tasks, (2004)","Di Mitri, D.; Ortega-Arranz, A.; Poquet, O.","CEUR-WS","16130073","9789666544899; 9788073780029; 9788024810256; 9789986342748; 9788073781712; 9782954494807; 9788024823911; 9789562361989; 8024810255; 807378002X","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178296455"

Background There has been an increase in the number of data science programs especially because of the increased appreciation of data as a multidisciplinary strategic resource. This has resulted in a greater need for skills in data science to extract meaningful insights from data. However, the data science programs are not enough to meet the demand for data science skills. While there is growth in data science programs, they appear more as a rebranding of existing engineering, computer science, mathematics, and statistics programs. Methodology A scoping review was adopted for the period 2010–2021 using six scholarly multidisciplinary databases: Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and the AIS Basket of eight journals. The study was narrowed down to 91 research articles and adopted a classification coding framework and correlation analysis for analysis. Contribution We theoretically contribute to the growing body of knowledge about the need to scale up data science through multidisciplinary pedagogies and disciplines as the demand grows. This paves the way for future research to understand which programs can provide current and future data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs. Findings The key results revealed the limited emphasis on DSE, especially in non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines. In addition, the results identified the need to find a suitable pedagogy or a set of pedagogies because of the multidisciplinary nature of DSE. Further, there is currently no existing framework to guide the design and development of DSE at various education levels, leading to sometimes inadequate programs. The study also noted the importance of various stakeholders who can contribute towards DSE and thus create opportunities in the DSE ecosystem. Most of the research studies reviewed were case studies that presented more STEM programs as compared to non-STEM. Recommendations for Practitioners We recommend CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) as a framework to adopt collaborative pedagogies to teach data science. This research implies that it is important for academia, policymakers, and data science content developers to work closely with organizations to understand their needs. Recommendations for Researchers We recommend future research into programs that can provide current and future data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs and how interdisciplinarity within these programs can be integrated. Impact on Society Data science expertise is essential for tackling societal issues and generating beneficial effects. The main problem is that data is diverse and always changing, necessitating ongoing (up)skilling. Academic institutions must therefore stay current with new advances, changing data, and organizational requirements. Industry experts might share views based on their practical knowledge. The DSE ecosystem can be shaped by collaborating with numerous stakeholders and being aware of each stakeholder’s function in order to advance data science internationally. Future Research The study found that there are a number of research opportunities that can be explored to improve the implementation of DSE, for instance, how can CRISP-DM be integrated into collaborative pedagogies to provide a fully comprehensive data science curriculum?","Data Science Applications In Education; Data Science Education; Pedagogy; Teaching/learning Strategies; Transdisciplinary Projects","","First, public institutions benefit from the teaching and learning funding model to support DSE through sourcing qualified lecturers and conducting research related to data science and DSE. For instance, Demchenko et al. (2017) presented a data science course that was funded by the European Commission, and Heinemann et al. (2018) presented a data science education for secondary schools that was funded by Deutsche Telekom Stiftung.","Liboni, Lara Bartocci, Sustainability as a dynamic organizational capability: a systematic review and a future agenda toward a sustainable transition, Journal of Cleaner Production, 142, pp. 308-322, (2017); Anderson, Paul E., An extensible online environment for teaching data science concepts through gamification, Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE, 2015-February, February, (2015); Anslow, Craig, Datathons: An experience report of data hackathons for data science education, pp. 615-620, (2016); Attwood, Teresa K., A global perspective on evolving bioinformatics and data science training needs, Briefings in Bioinformatics, 20, 2, pp. 398-404, (2019); Ayele, Workneh Yilma, Adapting CRISP-DM for idea mining a data mining process for generating ideas using a textual dataset, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 11, 6, pp. 20-32, (2020); Proceedings of the IEEE 40th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference, (2016); Baumer, Benjamin S., A Data Science Course for Undergraduates: Thinking With Data, American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 334-342, (2015); Berman, Francine, Realizing the potential of data science, Communications of the ACM, 61, 4, pp. 67-72, (2018); Archives of Data Science Series A, (2018); Blei, David M., Science and data science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 114, 33, pp. 8689-8692, (2017)","","Informing Science Institute","15393585; 15479714","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169448512"

The chapter provides practical advice regarding task design and development of activities that encourage critical analysis of statistical texts (such as in the news media or publications of official statistics agencies). Key topics include: analysis of the nature of ‘context knowledge’ and what are ‘meaningful and important’ contexts that are worthy of attention when teaching for understanding of Civic Statistics; ways to bring ‘meaningful and important’ contexts and texts about them (e.g., from newspapers or digital media) into the classroom and to make sure students understand them; ideas about question-posing and designing suitable tasks about these meaningful and important contexts, in particular how to shape ‘opinion questions’ that can elicit students’ critical reading, reflective thinking, and communication of thoughtful opinions; and ideas about the dispositions and habits of mind (e.g., critical stance, ability to ask ‘worry questions’) and skills (e.g., reading comprehension, critical interpretation) we want students to internalized and be able to activate when engaging statistical messages. Based on the guidelines and examples regarding these topics, the chapter discusses implications and recommendations for curriculum design and for teaching and teachers working both at the high-school, college, and adult education contexts, in mathematics education, statistics and data science education, and related STEM disciplines.","Contextualization; Critical Numeracy; Data Literacy; Official Statistics; Statistical Literacy; Task Design","","","Ainley, Janet, Learning to reason from samples: commentary from the perspectives of task design and the emergence of “big data”, Educational Studies in Mathematics, 88, 3, pp. 405-412, (2015); Ancker, Jessica S., The covid-19 pandemic and the power of numbers, Numeracy, 13, 2, pp. 1-11, (2020); Arnold, Pip, What Makes a Good Statistical Question?, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 29, 1, pp. 122-130, (2021); Budgett, Stephanie C., Developing statistical literacy in the final school year, Statistics Education Research Journal, 16, 1, pp. 139-162, (2017); Chance, Beth L., Sequencing topics in introductory statistics: A debate on what to teach when, American Statistician, 55, 2, pp. 140-144, (2001); Technology Innovations in Statistics Education, (2007); Cobb, George W., Mathematics, statistics, and teaching, American Mathematical Monthly, 104, 9, pp. 801-823, (1997); Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, (1987); Mathematics in School, (2001); Presented at the 13th International Conference on Mathematical Education Hamburg, (2016)","","Springer International Publishing","","9783031207488; 9783031207471","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169377442"

The present chapter examines issues that are essential for promoting necessary changes in the teaching and learning of Civic Statistics, which are needed for empowering citizens to engage with and analyze data sources and data-informed reasoning about burning issues in society, and critically interpret messages related to Civic Statistics encountered in the news media, social networks and related digital sources. The chapter first provides further illustrations of activities or tasks pertaining to Civic Statistics and shows how to analyse task demands in terms of the facets and tools they require. Then, general questions are examined regarding the all-important alignment of the features of Civic Statistics and their demands with curriculum plans and learning goals, classroom teaching practices, and assessment methods. We provide some guidelines for developing assessment items relevant to Civic Statistics. Finally, the chapter presents six broad recommendations related to changes in systemic issues that can promote attention to and critical understanding of Civic Statistics, at the school and university levels, and which can improve effective instruction and assessment in this regard, within mathematics education, statistics and data science education, and related disciplines.","Curriculum Alignment; Data Literacy; Media Literacy; Statistical Literacy; Statistics Education","","","American Statistical Association and National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, (2020); American Statistical Association, (2016); Gal, Iddo, Official statistics and statistics education: Bridging the gap, Journal of Official Statistics, 33, 1, pp. 79-100, (2017); A Product of the Procivicstat Project, (2018); Ridgway, Jim E., Implications of the Data Revolution for Statistics Education, International Statistical Review, 84, 3, pp. 528-549, (2016); Prepared for A Procivicstat Workshop at the Iase Satellite Conference, (2017); United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, (2012)","","Springer International Publishing","","9783031207488; 9783031207471","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169369322"

The framework is organized around three key dimensions involving engagement & action, knowledge, and enabling processes. It identifies knowledge-bases covering meaning for society and policy and critical evaluation and reflection; selected statistical and mathematical constructs and skills; core literacy and mathematical skills; understanding models and modelling, multivariate ideas and textual and rich visual representations; knowledge of research and data production methods and extensions related to official statistics and risk on the societal level; and it emphasises the importance of appropriate dispositions, critical stance, and habits of mind. We offer examples and curriculum tasks that illustrate each of the 11 facets and their interconnectedness. We also describe the use of a ‘radar plot’ tool to support the analysis of how balanced are prospective class activities or test items in terms of covering the 11 facets and tools.

Accordingly, the book is suitable for teachers and lecturers in all educational frameworks: K-12, academia and industry. This book aims at closing a significant gap in the literature on the pedagogy of data science. While there are many articles and white papers dealing with the curriculum of data science (i.e., what to teach?), the pedagogical aspect of the field (i.e., how to teach?) is almost neglected. At the same time, the importance of the pedagogical aspects of data science increases as more and more programs are currently open to a variety of people. This book provides a variety of pedagogical discussions and specific teaching methods and frameworks, as well as includes exercises, and guidelines related to many data science concepts (e.g., data thinking and the data science workflow), main machine learning algorithms and concepts (e.g., KNN, SVM, Neural Networks, performance metrics, confusion matrix, and biases) and data science professional topics (e.g., ethics, skills and research approach).

Effective data science education requires a comprehensive approach that incorporates theoretical knowledge, practical skills, and industry relevance. However, it is difficult to find appropriate teaching strategies and tools that successfully integrate all these elements into the classroom. Consequently, there is a need to identify and develop effective pedagogical methods, instructional resources, and technological solutions that enable instructors to deliver well-rounded data science education that caters to the diverse needs of students and prepares them for real-world data-driven challenges. Knowing which technology is appropriate to use in conjunction with a particular teaching pedagogy to deliver a particular piece of learning material to diverse students is crucial. Therefore, this study aimed to explore how the TPACK (technological pedagogical content knowledge) influences data science teaching practices. To achieve this, the study surveyed 26 data science instructors to assess their confidence in the seven TPACK constructs. The findings of the study showed a low representation of women in data science education. The findings also showed a balanced knowledge between pedagogy and technological content, indicating that instructors can contribute to a comprehensive and engaging learning environment that supports student success in data science education. Despite this positive finding being established, it was not clear which technological teaching and learning tools instructors are familiar with. To this end, future studies are recommended in this area. The results further showed that model evaluation is not taught at undergraduate level. Therefore, the study recommends continuous professional development for data science instructors to effectively contribute towards training current and future data scientists. This is necessary since technologies, data, and data science tools and techniques evolve. Furthermore, the study recommends research be conducted on the type of data science framework required to guide instructors in terms of curriculum design, pedagogies, and technological tools. Research that informs policy is also necessary to support efforts directed at data literacy, especially to support personnel involved in human capacity development in data science. Lastly, within the scope of data science, interdisciplinary collaboration at national and international levels is recommended so that instructors can stay updated with advancements in subject matter, technology, and pedagogy.","Data Science; Education; Educational Technology; Teaching; Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge","","None.","Ambusaidi, Abdullah Khamis, Exploring pedagogical decision making from the lens of science teachers in response to different pedagogical issues, Social Sciences and Humanities Open, 5, 1, (2022); Anderson, Paul E., An extensible online environment for teaching data science concepts through gamification, Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE, 2015-February, February, (2015); Asamoah, Daniel, Interdisciplinarity in Data Science Pedagogy: A Foundational Design, Journal of Computer Information Systems, 60, 4, pp. 370-377, (2020); Başaran, Bülent, Investigating science and mathematics teacher candidate’s perceptions of tpack-21 based on 21st century skills, Elementary Education Online, 19, 4, pp. 2212-2226, (2020); Beckman, Matthew D., Implementing Version Control With Git and GitHub as a Learning Objective in Statistics and Data Science Courses, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 29, S1, pp. S132-S144, (2021); Investing in America S Data Science and Analytics Talent the Case for Action, (2017); Dynamics of Data Science Skills, (2019); Journal of Risk and Financial Management, (2018); Daniel, Ben Kei, Big Data and data science: A critical review of issues for educational research, British Journal of Educational Technology, 50, 1, pp. 101-113, (2019); Harvard Data Science Review, (2021)","","Elsevier Ltd","25902911","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165590328"

Recent publications have criticized the use of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools in the classroom, with little focus on the potential benefits. This article focuses on the potential of ChatGPT as an educational tool for statistics and data science. It encourages readers to consider the history of trepidation surrounding introducing new technology in the classroom, such as the calculator. We explore the possibility of leveraging ChatGPT’s capabilities in statistics and data science education, providing examples of how ChatGPT can aid in developing course materials and suggestions for how educators can prompt students to interact with ChatGPT responsibly. As educators, we can guide the use of generative AI tools in statistics and data science classrooms so that students and educators can leverage the benefits of this technology.","Artificial Intelligence; Data Science; Educational Techniques; Statistics Education","","","Monitor on Psychology, (2023); undefined, (2023); Innovations in Education and Teaching International, (2023); undefined, (2022); Los Angeles Times, (2023); Dwivedi, Yogesh K., “So what if ChatGPT wrote it?” Multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational AI for research, practice and policy, International Journal of Information Management, 71, (2023); Ellington, Aimee J., A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Calculators on Students' Achievement and Attitude Levels in Precollege Mathematics Classes, Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, 34, 5, pp. 433-463, (2003); undefined, (2023); Teachers College Newsroom, (2023); undefined, (2022)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","26939169","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164687651"

Data science is one of the six scientific gaps that emerged in the global experience with the COVID-19 pandemic. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) can potentially address the critical need to build public health data science capabilities and competencies in outbreak and pandemic management. The objective of the study was to perform a scoping review with thematic analysis and identify the key themes across MOOCs covering content on outbreak and pandemic management using qualitative evidence synthesis. A total of 458 unique records were found, of which 69 were relevant to the pandemic and outbreak management context. Thematic analysis identified three cross-cutting themes: (i) personal and professional competencies, (ii) institutional and organisational response, and (iii) community participation—the growing role of MOOCs in building competencies that are empowering and enabling to individuals and communities. A limited number of courses covered the use of data science in outbreak and pandemic management suggesting the need for future MOOCs to integrate data science knowledge and methods in public health education and training. Data science competencies are central to strengthening the health system and effective public health response. MOOCs present a promising opportunity to deliver public health data science education, integrating domain expertise, public health ethics, and data science methods.","Massive Open Online Courses (moocs); Outbreak Management; Pandemic Management; Public Health Data Science; Public Health Education; Data Science; E-learning; Information Management; Health Data; Health Education; Health Systems; Massive Open Online Course; Outbreak Management; Pandemic Management; Public Health Data Science; Public Health Education; Science Education; Public Health","Data Science; E-learning; Information management; Health data; Health education; Health systems; Massive open online course; Outbreak management; Pandemic management; Public health data science; Public health education; Science education; Public health","","Journal of Interactive Media in Education, (2016); Zhang, Qingpeng, Data science approaches to confronting the COVID-19 pandemic: A narrative review, Philosophical transactions.

Many might begin their exploration by taking a course at a local two-year college. Currently, not many of these institutions in the U.S. offer data science courses. This article introduces the perspective lens of students who have gone through the Montgomery College Data Science Certificate Program. We found that, contrary to many other educational fields at the College, data science students tend to come from diverse backgrounds and career paths. A common theme emerged that all students learned valuable skills and applications such as coding in various programming languages and approaches to machine learning. Other meaningful themes included an appreciation of course accessibility, especially catered toward busy professionals who might only be able to take evening courses. Students appreciated learning that data science and ethics are intertwined. Finally, it was evident that going through the data science program positively impacted the lives and careers of these students. The implications of the themes of these student experiences are discussed as they relate to data science education.

Although various tools and services such as Jupyter Notebook and Google Cloud's AI have been developed for building and training models, they are not suitable for direct use in educational settings. For example, teachers expect a platform where they can easily distribute and grade programming assignments, and students want to quickly start coding and training models without the burden of setting up an environment. To this end, we develop MLadder, an online training system for machine learning and data science education.

One of the key reasons for student attrition is the inability of students to develop an identity and a sense of belonging. This study aims to understand the role of a data science learning community in helping students to develop identity and a sense of belonging. The study used a mixed-methods approach to collect and analyze the data. The study used a pre–post survey to understand students’ perceptions regarding identity formation and sense of belonging. The results of the survey study indicated that the perception of identity formation and sense of belonging increased as students progressed through the semester. To further investigate the reasons for the increase in the perception of identity formation and sense of belonging, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted. The results of the interview revealed that living in the data science learning community, participating in various events and interacting with faculty, staff and working with peers of similar interest helped students to develop a data science identity and leader identity, as well as experience sense of belonging.","Communities Of Practice; Data Science Education; Identity Formation; Learning Community; Sense Of Belonging; Undergraduate Education","","This research was supported in part by the Lilly Endowment Charting the Future Phase I Planning Grant, through the Purdue Office of the Provost.

The lectures on these topics cannot stand alone without coding practice on real-world data sets. Some instructors prefer to utilize small data sets for practice in classroom or assignments, which limits experimental experiences and may even bring misleading experiences to students. Others may try to assign large data sets to students, but students may not be able to bear with the running time due to the efficiency issue raised by several factors (e.g., data size, algorithm complexity, computing power, etc.). In this paper, we first learned students' preferences on the scalability of data sets for practice in data science courses, and performed experimental analysis by running different data science algorithms over both student laptops and personal/office computers, in order to deliver a suggestion about the appropriate data size for practice in multiple scenarios (e.g., in-class practice, assignments, class projects, research projects, etc.).

Data feminism is an approach that draws on feminist scholarship and action to humanize data and contend with the relationships between data and power. In this review paper, we draw on principles from data feminism to review 42 different educational research and design approaches that engage youth with data, many of which are educational technology intensive and bear on future data-intensive educational technology research and design projects. We describe how the projects engage students with examining power, challenging power, elevating emotion and lived experience, rethinking binaries and hierarchies, embracing pluralism, considering context, and making labour visible. In doing so, we articulate ways that current data education initiatives involve youth in thinking about issues of justice and inclusion. These projects may offer examples of varying complexity for future work to contend with and, ideally, extend in order to further realize data feminism in K-12 data science education. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Data feminism is an emergent framework for changing data practices and discourse in service of equity and justice. Data science education is rapidly growing as a topic of interest in the educational technology research and design communities. Many educational technology and design projects have been launched and shared in publications that preceded the widespread distribution of the data feminism framework. What this paper adds Data feminism is partially re-articulated in terms familiar to educational technology research communities. Prior and recent projects are organized with respect to how they illustrate potential connections to core data feminism principles. This paper identifies specific strategies that recent projects have used that have potential for realizing data feminism principles. Implications for practice and/or policy Educational technologists can use the re-articulated principles of data feminism for education to inform their future design work. Tractable steps to achieve data justice that are attainable within existing educational systems can be pursued. Communities can and should bring together multiple ways of knowing to support new educational practices and futures with data.","Data Feminism; Data Literacy; Data Science Education; Statistics Education; Data Science; Data Feminism; Data Literacy; Data Science Education; Design Programs; Power; Research Communities; Science Education; Statistics Educations; Technology Designs; Technology Research; Educational Technology","Data Science; Data feminism; Data literacy; Data science education; Design programs; Power; Research communities; Science education; Statistics educations; Technology designs; Technology research; Educational technology","","Abrahamson, Dor, The Future of Embodied Design for Mathematics Teaching and Learning, Frontiers in Education, 5, (2020); Agesilaou, Andria, Empowering Students to be Data Literate: The Design and Implementation of a Learning Environment to Foster Critical Data Literacy, Proceedings of International Conference of the Learning Sciences, ICLS, pp. 458-465, (2021); Barsalou, Lawrence W., Perceptual symbol systems, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22, 4, pp. 577-609, (1999); Basu, Satabdi, The role of evidence centered design and participatory design in a playful assessment for computational thinking about data, pp. 985-991, (2020); Race After Technology Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code, (2019); International Handbook of Research in Medical Education, (2002); Designing Tools and Activities for Data Literacy Learners, (2015); Journal of Community Informatics, (2016); Börner, Katy, Data visualization literacy: Definitions, conceptual frameworks, exercises, and assessments, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 116, 6, pp. 1857-1864, (2019); Bowler, Leanne, “It lives all around us”: Aspects of data literacy in teen's lives, Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 54, 1, pp. 27-35, (2017)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","00071013; 14678535","","BJETD","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132591629"

However, the actual techniques learners need to become proficient in are still somewhat “in-construction”, as the relatively new field of data science is constantly expanding to meet new data-related demands. Data science education needs to develop innovative means to keep up with this expansion that focus less on proficiency in specific techniques, but rather introduce novices to authentic data practices, and the authentic purposes directing the authentic practices. This paper focuses on a specific practice, the use of simulations to generate and examine data, in the context of authentic scientific Citizen Science research. We provide a case study of one pair of middle school students' engagement in an extended learning sequence including simulation activities inspired by authentic data practices, adapted to also be authentic for young students. While the simulation activity was inspired by the scientists' purposes, our findings illustrate four different actual purposes the students attributed to it. We also show that as the students deepened their engagement with the simulation, they gradually appropriated its intended purpose, alongside articulating more mature views of data-related concepts. The conclusions summarize the four different purposes the students expressed and identify aspects of design that contributed to the gradual re-shaping process of their actual purposes. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Introducing students to data science and statistics has become essential nowadays. Students need to be introduced to authentic data practices, but also to the authentic purposes motivating these practices. Utilizing computerized simulations is a common authentic practice in science and statistics. The pedagogical, intended, use of computerized simulations can be inspired by the authentic purposes but should also be adapted to be authentic for the students. Students may have actual purposes that differ from the authentic and intended purposes. What this paper adds A case study of a pair of middle school students' engagement with a computerized simulation tool, as part of their participation in a Citizen Science project. The students expressed four actual purposes for the simulation. The students' initial purposes differed from the intended purposes, limiting their participation. Key aspects of the overall activity design ultimately supported the students to appropriate the intended purpose of the simulation and more deeply engage with the intended statistical notions. Implications for practice and/or policy It is important to consider that students may attribute purposes that differ from those of the teacher or the activity designer, to any learning activity they engage in. Making the intended purposes more explicit may be helpful, but potentially not enough for students to appropriate them. Researchers' prompts, students' freedom to reshape their use of the simulation tool and productive discussion norms can be beneficial aspects.","Authenticity; Computerized-simulations; Data Science Education; Educational Technology; Purposes; Data Science; Education Computing; Educational Technology; Case-studies; Citizen Science; Computerized Simulation; Data Practices; Data Science Education; Information Age; Middle School Students; Purpose; Science Education; Student Engagement; Students","Data Science; Education computing; Educational technology; Case-studies; Citizen science; Computerized simulation; Data practices; Data science education; Information age; Middle school students; Purpose; Science education; Student engagement; Students","We thank the University of Haifa, the Technion Israel institute of Technology and the TCSS Center of Excellence supported by the Israel Science Foundation (grant no. 2678/17) for supporting this research, as well as the Connections research team.","Computer Simulations in Science and Technology Studies, (1998); Ainley, Janet, Connecting engagement and focus in pedagogic task design, British Educational Research Journal, 32, 1, pp. 23-38, (2006); Arcavi, Abraham, The role of visual representations in the learning of mathematics, Educational Studies in Mathematics, 52, 3, pp. 215-241, (2003); Topics and Trends in Current Statistics Education Research International Perspectives, (2019); Design Research in Statistics Education on Symbolizing and Computer Tools, (2004); Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics Simulations in Polymer Science, (1995); Budgett, Stephanie C., Modeling and linking the Poisson and exponential distributions, ZDM - International Journal on Mathematics Education, 50, 7, pp. 1281-1294, (2018); Technology Innovations in Statistics Education, (2007); Dvir, Michal, The role of model comparison in young learners’ reasoning with statistical models and modeling, ZDM - International Journal on Mathematics Education, 50, 7, pp. 1183-1196, (2018); Dvir, Michal, The double-edged sword of conjecturing, Mathematical Thinking and Learning, 25, 2, pp. 153-176, (2023)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","00071013; 14678535","","BJETD","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131384847"

In recent years, machine learning (ML) 's surging impact has sparked discourse about the importance of AI education for young people, and in recent years, several initiatives and projects pursuing the mission of K-12 AI education have emerged. In 2020 Israel's Ministry of Education (MoE) approved a new comprehensive and rigorous ML curriculum targeting 11 and 12th-grade pupils majoring in computer science (CS). The curriculum is meant to be taught by the existing CS teacher workforce. However, since ML theory and practice are fundamentally different from traditional CS [2], implementing this thorough ML curriculum poses substantial challenges in developing an effective teaching workforce to deliver it. In this research, we suggest a solution for this challenge in the form of a blended-learning (BL) program. The online component of this program is based mainly on Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization MOOCs series [3]. The BL program, enhanced with pedagogical training, is also used for the professional development (PD) of the teachers who deliver the program. Out of fourteen CS teachers who participated in the PD in the summer of 2021, ten teach the BL program this year to 273 high-school pupils. Initial results demonstrate the achievement of the curriculum learning goals and provide compelling preliminary evidence that this program enables CS teachers who are new to machine learning to teach this thorough curriculum effectively","Artificial Intelligence Education; Blended-learning; Computer Science Education; Data Science Education; K-12 Ai Education; Machine Learning Education; Moocs; Deep Learning; Education Computing; Learning Systems; Personnel Training; Artificial Intelligence Education; Blended Learning; Computer Science Education; Data Science Education; K-12 Ai Education; Learning Projects; Machine Learning Education; Machine-learning; Mooc; Science Education; Curricula","Deep learning; Education computing; Learning systems; Personnel training; Artificial intelligence education; Blended learning; Computer Science Education; Data science education; K-12 AI education; Learning projects; Machine learning education; Machine-learning; MOOC; Science education; Curricula","","Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2021, (2021); Shapiro, R.

However, many ITS rely heavily on expert design and hand-crafted rules. This makes them difficult to build and transfer across domains and limits their potential efficacy. In this paper, we investigate how feedback in a large-scale ITS can be automatically generated in a data-driven way, and more specifically how personalization of feedback can lead to improvements in student performance outcomes. First, in this paper we propose a machine learning approach to generate personalized feedback in an automated way, which takes individual needs of students into account, while alleviating the need of expert intervention and design of hand-crafted rules. We leverage state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to provide students with personalized feedback using hints and Wikipedia-based explanations. Second, we demonstrate that personalized feedback leads to improved success rates at solving exercises in practice: our personalized feedback model is used in Korbit, a large-scale dialogue-based ITS with around 20,000 students launched in 2019. We present the results of experiments with students and show that the automated, data-driven, personalized feedback leads to a significant overall improvement of 22.95% in student performance outcomes and substantial improvements in the subjective evaluation of the feedback.","Data Science Education; Deep Learning; Dialogue-based Tutoring Systems; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Natural Language Processing; Personalized Feedback; Personalized Learning; Automation; Computer Aided Instruction; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing Systems; Students; Turing Machines; Automatically Generated; Intelligent Tutoring System; Machine Learning Approaches; Natural Language Processing; Personalized Feedback; Potential Efficacy; Student Performance; Subjective Evaluations; Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems","Automation; Computer aided instruction; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Students; Turing machines; Automatically generated; Intelligent tutoring system; Machine learning approaches; NAtural language processing; Personalized feedback; Potential efficacy; Student performance; Subjective evaluations; Intelligent vehicle highway systems","","Proc of the Workshop on Proof Transformation Proof Presentations and Complexity of Proofs Ptp 01, (2001); Ahn, Jae-wook, Adaptive visual dialog for intelligent tutoring systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10948 LNAI, pp. 413-418, (2018); Albacete, Patricia L., The impact of student model updates on contingent scaffolding in a natural-language tutoring system, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11625 LNAI, pp. 37-47, (2019); Proceedings of Artificial Intelligence in Education, (2001); Anania, Joanne, The influence of instructional conditions on student learning and achievement, Evaluation in Education, 7, 1, pp. 1-92, (1983); Anderson, John Robert, Intelligent tutoring systems, Science, 228, 4698, pp. 456-462, (1985); Andrews, Peter B., ETPS: A system to help students write formal proofs, Journal of Automated Reasoning, 32, 1, pp. 75-92, (2004); Baker, Ryan Shaun Joazeiro D., Stupid Tutoring Systems, Intelligent Humans, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 26, 2, pp. 600-614, (2016); Benzmüller, Christoph, Natural language dialog with a tutor system for mathematical proofs, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4429 LNAI, pp. 1-14, (2007); Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, (2006)","","Springer","15604306; 15604292","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111353737"

This paper presents a highly innovative course in a UK university that introduces undergraduate medical students to data science. It also discusses a study on student perspectives on the learning and teaching of health data science. Methods: The pedagogical design elements of the Data Science in Medicine course are discussed, along with its syllabus, assessment methodology and flipped classroom delivery. The course has been offered to approximately 630 students over three years. Student perspectives were investigated through three focus groups with the participation of 19 students across different study years in medicine. An experiment was conducted regarding instructor-led vs. video-based modalities of online programming labs, with the participation of 8 students. Results: The course has led to improved data competency among medical students and to a positive change in their opinions about data science. Motivating the course and showing relevance to clinical practice was one of the biggest challenges. Statistics was perceived by focus group participants as an essential data skill. Including data science in the medical curriculum was perceived as important by Year 1 students, while opinions varied between Year 4/5 participants. Video-based online labs were preferred over instructor-led online labs, and they were found to be more useful and enjoyable, without leading to any significant difference in academic performance. Conclusions: Teaching data science to undergraduate medicine students is highly desirable and feasible. We recommend including statistics in the curriculum and practical skill development through simple and clinically-relevant data science tasks, supported through video-based online labs. Further reporting on similar courses is needed, as well as larger-scale studies on student perspectives.","Data Science; Education; Health; Health Informatics; Medicine; Training; Curricula; Data Science; Laboratories; Medical Education; Medicine; Students; Teaching; Focus Groups; Health Data; Health Informatics; Learning And Teachings; Medical Curriculum; Medical Students; Online Labs; Science Education; Student Perspectives; Teaching Practices; Medical Informatics; Academic Achievement; Adult; Article; Clinical Practice; Curriculum; Data Science; Female; Health Data; Human; Human Experiment; Learning; Major Clinical Study; Male; Medical Informatics; Medical Student; Skill; Teaching; Videorecording; Medical Education; University; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Learning; Students, Medical; Universities","Curricula; Data Science; Laboratories; Medical education; Medicine; Students; Teaching; Focus groups; Health data; Health informatics; Learning and teachings; Medical curriculum; Medical students; Online labs; Science education; Student perspectives; Teaching practices; Medical informatics; academic achievement; adult; article; clinical practice; curriculum; data science; female; health data; human; human experiment; learning; major clinical study; male; medical informatics; medical student; skill; teaching; videorecording; medical education; university; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Learning; Students, Medical; Universities","The authors would like to thank the Usher Institute at the University of Edinburgh for funding this work through an Usher Education Development Grant.

In the world of the 21st century people who are data illiterate, will increasingly find themselves in the same situation, irrespective of their field of employment. Companies and society need people who can analyse data and use the resulting information to direct decisions. Another aspect of the 21st century that society struggles with, is the increasing prevalence of mental illness due to work pressures, failing marriages, torn family structures, isolation and so forth. The mental health of students is a major cause for concern since one in three students show signs of depression and anxiety. Within this context there is a need to develop a plan to address the instructional design for data science students. They need to learn relevant content in a manner that will equip them to succeed in the workplace and society at large within a context where their wellbeing will be nurtured. The study employs the Systems Informed Positive Psychology perspective to direct the process of improving the design of data science modules. Critical Systems Thinking determines how different components are interlinked, and how they can best be changed to attain the overall goal by listening to the voices of all the affected parties. Directed content analysis of comments received from 284 students participating in an introductory statistics module at a South African university indicates that students intuitively mentioned several aspects of the Flourishing Classrooms Systems Model, thereby indicating that students would like a thriving classroom. The students' voice indicated that things like emotional bonding and supportiveness are important to them. Little classroom flexibility is experienced by the students, it may be due to lecturers who are lacking in leadership in the classroom and are unwilling to negotiate on matters with the students. Students indicated the importance of proper classroom communication - clarity and listener skills are crucial for students to flourish in a class. Finally, several aspects of classroom wellbeing were mentioned: strength focus rather than zooming in on shortcomings, lecturers' emotional management, students' increased attention through active learning, improved coping through better planning and time management, and the forming of good study habits. This study shows that by employing systems thinking, the inter-connectedness of diverse factors emerged more clearly, enabling educationists to develop better solutions that may make a difference in the lives of many students.","Data Science Education; Flourishing Classroom; Positive Education; Systems Informed Positive Psychology; Data Science; Diseases; Education Computing; Systems Thinking; Critical Systems Thinking; Data Science Education; Flourishing Classroom; Mental Illness; Positive Education; Positive Psychology; Science Education; System Informed Positive Psychology; Wellbeing; Work Pressures; Students","Data Science; Diseases; Education computing; Systems thinking; Critical systems thinking; Data science education; Flourishing classroom; Mental illness; Positive education; Positive psychology; Science education; System informed positive psychology; Wellbeing; Work pressures; Students","","Contemporary School Psychology, (2020); Systems Thinking Systems Practice, (1981); Chodkiewicz, Alicia R., Positive psychology school-based interventions: A reflection on current success and future directions, Review of Education, 5, 1, pp. 60-86, (2017); Systems Approach, (1968); Coetzee, Wilma, Determining the Needs of Introductory Statistics University Students: A Qualitative Survey Study, Perspectives in Education, 39, 2, pp. 197-213, (2021); Deng, Jiawen, The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbance in higher education students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Psychiatry Research, 301, (2021); Fish, Marian C., The Classroom Systems Observation Scale: Development of an instrument to assess classrooms using a systems perspective, Learning Environments Research, 3, 1, pp. 67-92, (2000); Hsieh, Hsiufang, Three approaches to qualitative content analysis, Qualitative Health Research, 15, 9, pp. 1277-1288, (2005); Systems Methodology for the Management Sciences, (1991); Systems Thinking Creative Holism for Managers, (2003)","","International Society for the Systems Sciences (ISSS)","","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173508726"

Data science education has seen rapid growth over the past decade. To provide students with hands-on opportunities to work with real data, many data science programs have advocated for and implemented experiential learning opportunities throughout the curriculum, which has been shown in a wide variety of literature to have many benefits. Most experiential learning opportunities in STEM programs are provided through capstone and engineering design courses; this is becoming increasingly the case in data science programs as well where several universities have developed data science capstone programs in which students work with clients on the client's real-world data sets. While client-sponsored capstone projects are an exemplar of experiential learning, they may pose major challenges to implement and can be particularly resource-intensive for institutions; this is especially the case in data science where the legalities of data sharing may come with additional hurdles. Because of this, we were motivated to develop a novel client-facing data science consulting course that provides a unique experiential learning scenario to both undergraduate and graduate students while requiring much fewer resources and legalities. In our novel data science consulting course, groups of students work directly with real clients in a consulting clinic setting to provide data science guidance and short-term help with data science challenges. Through this process, students learn about the diversity of real-world problems in data science, how to lead consultations with clients effectively as a team, how to frame data science challenges and research possible solutions, and how to communicate solutions to clients in reports and presentations. We leveraged best practices in consulting courses developed in business school settings to design our course. Additionally, the consulting course serves as a community service initiative whereby researchers, clinicians, non-profit and government workers, and industry professionals benefit from the advice and short-term help provided through consultation. In this paper, we report how our consulting course is set up, how clients from both within and outside the university can seek help at the consulting clinic, and how the structure of the course enables students to have firsthand experience working on many real-world data science problems with clients. Finally, we discuss how student performance is assessed in this course, the lessons learned from offering this course, and recommendations for other data science programs in universities that wish to design similar courses.","Consulting Course; Data Science Education; Experiential Learning; Data Science; Facings; Students; Capstone Projects; Consulting Course; Curriculum Development; Data Science Education; Experiential Learning; Innovative Practices; Learning Opportunity; Real-world; Science Education; Science Projects; Curricula","Data Science; Facings; Students; Capstone projects; Consulting course; Curriculum development; Data science education; Experiential learning; Innovative practices; Learning opportunity; Real-world; Science education; Science projects; Curricula","","Anderson, Paul E., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, pp. 145-150, (2014); De Veaux, Richard D., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 15-30, (2017); Data Science for Undergraduates Opportunities and Options, (2018); Allen, Genevera I., Experiential Learning in Data Science: Developing an Interdisciplinary, Client-Sponsored Capstone Program, pp. 516-522, (2021); Rosenthal, Stephanie L., A data science major: Building skills and confidence, pp. 178-184, (2020); Harvard Data Science Review, (2020); Hardin, Johanna S., Data Science in Statistics Curricula: Preparing Students to “Think with Data”, American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 343-353, (2015); Ramamurthy, Bina, A practical and sustainable model for learning and teaching data science, pp. 169-174, (2016); Silva, Jesus, Data Sciences and Teaching Methods—Learning, Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering, 637, pp. 335-342, (2020); Intelligent Environments, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15394565","9781424447152; 0780356438; 9781538611739; 9780780390775; 0780379616; 0780314824; 9780780308329; 9781509059195; 0780390776; 1424410843","PFECD","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143816844"

The use of computing software has become ubiquitous and a working knowledge of data science has become increasingly essential for researchers in all domains. However, curriculum development focusing on imparting foundational programming skills and fundamentals of data science for researchers in domains other than computing has been scarce. Thus, there is an unmet need for curriculum development involving computational thinking, programming, and the fundamentals of data science for this audience. Recognizing these growing needs and demands of researchers to learn programming and data science that can then be applied to their area of research or practice, we developed an introductory course in programming and data science for PDRs in biology and medicine. The primary goal of the course was to develop computational thinking skills in PDRs who hail from backgrounds that have traditionally not focused on inculcating computational thinking. This course covered the fundamental concepts of programming using either Python or R - languages that researchers outside the computing community use in numerous ways including the statistical analysis of large datasets that are becoming increasingly common in biomedical research. Further, PDRs enrolled in the course were introduced to some of the broad categories of problems in data science - exploratory data analysis, classification, regression, and clustering - along with relevant algorithms and how they can be applied to real-world datasets in their respective domains using packages or libraries in Python or R. We also report the feedback from the enrolled PDRs, lessons learned, and recommendations for instructors interested in designing similar curricula. Our course focusing on computing and data science education for postdoctoral scholars from a non-computing background demonstrates a promising model for incorporating computing education in other areas of study that do not traditionally have a focus on computing education as well as in continuing education.","Computer Science Education; Continuing Education; Data Science Education; Interdisciplinary Computing Education; Classification (of Information); Clustering Algorithms; Curricula; Data Science; Education Computing; High Level Languages; Precipitation (meteorology); Ubiquitous Computing; Computational Thinkings; Computer Science Education; Computing Education; Continuing Education; Curriculum Development; Data Science Education; Interdisciplinary Computing Education; Introductory Course; Postdoctoral Researchers; Science Education; Large Dataset","Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Curricula; Data Science; Education computing; High level languages; Precipitation (meteorology); Ubiquitous computing; Computational thinkings; Computer Science Education; Computing education; Continuing education; Curriculum development; Data science education; Interdisciplinary computing education; Introductory course; Postdoctoral researchers; Science education; Large dataset","","Provost, Foster John, Data Science and its Relationship to Big Data and Data-Driven Decision Making, Big Data, 1, 1, pp. 51-59, (2013); Franklin, Diana M., Putting the computer science in computing education research, Communications of the ACM, 58, 2, pp. 34-36, (2015); Wooley, John C., Catalyzing Inquiry at the Interface of Computing and Biology, pp. 1-445, (2006); Gentleman, Robert C., Bioconductor: open software development for computational biology and bioinformatics., Genome Biology, 5, 10, (2004); Robinson, Mark D., edgeR: A Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data, Bioinformatics, 26, 1, pp. 139-140, (2009); Schoonenberg, Vivien A.C., CRISPRO: Identification of functional protein coding sequences based on genome editing dense mutagenesis Jin-Soo Kim, Genome Biology, 19, 1, (2018); Spielman, Stephanie J., Pyvolve: A flexible python module for simulating sequences along phylogenies, PLOS ONE, 10, 9, (2015); Cock, Peter J.A., Biopython: Freely available Python tools for computational molecular biology and bioinformatics, Bioinformatics, 25, 11, pp. 1422-1423, (2009); Pevzner, Pavel A., Computing has changed biology-biology education must catch up, Science, 325, 5940, pp. 541-542, (2009); Wright, April Marie, The why, when, and how of computing in biology classrooms, F1000Research, 8, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15394565","9781424447152; 0780356438; 9781538611739; 9780780390775; 0780379616; 0780314824; 9780780308329; 9781509059195; 0780390776; 1424410843","PFECD","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143778082"

Through a review of the literature, as well as an examination of different pedagogical approaches and practices used by various formal and informal training programs in Africa, we examined the experience of women and girls. We conducted a mapping of the training and networks that have been set up to provide knowledge and skills and to empower women in data science.

New data science education programs, which are being launched at an increasing rate, are designed for multiple education levels and populations. Machine learning (ML) is an essential element of data science that requires an extensive background in mathematics. Whereas it is possible to teach the principles of ML only as a black box, novice learners might find it difficult to improve an algorithm’s performance without a white box understanding of the underlying ML algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a pedagogical method, based on hands-on pen-and-paper tasks, to support white box understanding of ML algorithms for learners who lack the level of mathematics knowledge required for this purpose. Data were collected using a comprehension questionnaire and analyzed according to the process-object theory borrowed from mathematics education research. We present evidence of the effectiveness of this method based on data collected in an introduction-level data science course for graduate psychology students. This population had extensive psychology domain knowledge, as well as an established background in statistics, but had gaps in mathematical and computer science knowledge compared with data science majors. The research contribution is both practical and theoretical. Practically, we present a learning module that supports non-major data science students’ white box understanding of ML. Theoretically, we propose a data analysis method to evaluate students’ conceptions of ML algorithms.","Data Science Education; Machine Learning; Process-object Duality Theory; Statistics Education Research","","This work was supported by generous funding from the Technion’s Machine Learning & Intelligent Systems (MLIS) Center.

To date, the research on the IDS course has primarily focused on pedagogy, professional learning for teachers, and the curriculum. This mixed-methods case study expands our understanding by analyzing the perspective of IDS students at a California public high school. Selfdetermination theory provides a useful frame for interpreting how these students experience the IDS course. The theory focuses on conditions for students to engage in meaningful learning: competence (self-efficacy), autonomy (agency), and relatedness (a sense of belonging). The findings from this case study suggest the IDS students feel confident, empowered, and part of a vibrant community, unlike previous mathematics and statistics courses they may have completed; and use specific language to describe their joy in problem-solving and the accessibility of the course. These findings have implications for the development and refinement of any high school data science course, including IDS.","Data Science Education; High School Mathematics Pathways; Non-traditional High School Mathematics; Statistics Education Research","","I wish to thank Ms. Arcega and her IDS students for participating in the research study.

Through a range of approaches, contexts, and age groups, the papers seek to illuminate how to help learners become adept at employing data interpretation conventions, scrutinizing the reliability of data representations, and examining whether data representations render humans and more-than-humans visible or invisible, central, peripheral, unidimensional, or complex. Jointly, the papers examine how to cultivate publics who make use of consequential data representations to negotiate their everyday lives, and who identify and resist datafied injustice.","Axiology; Data Literacies; Data Science Education; Epistemology; Justice; Post-truth; Axiology; Cultural Groups; Data Literacy; Data Representations; Data Science Education; Epistemology; Group Memberships; Justice; Post-truth; Science Education","Axiology; Cultural groups; Data literacy; Data representations; Data science education; Epistemology; Group memberships; Justice; Post-truth; Science education","","Arastoopour Irgens, Golnaz, Data literacies and social justice: Exploring critical data literacies through sociocultural perspectives, Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Conference, CSCL, 1, pp. 406-413, (2020); Barzilai, Sarit, A review of educational responses to the “post-truth” condition: Four lenses on “post-truth” problems, Educational Psychologist, 55, 3, pp. 107-119, (2020); Barton, Angela Calabrese, We be burnin'! agency, identity, and science learning, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 19, 2, pp. 187-229, (2010); Brown, Julie C., A metasynthesis of the complementarity of culturally responsive and inquiry-based science education in K-12 settings: Implications for advancing equitable science teaching and learning, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 54, 9, pp. 1143-1173, (2017); Buehl, Michelle M., The role of epistemic cognition in teacher learning and praxis, pp. 247-264, (2016); Chinn, Clark A., Disagreeing about how to know: The instructional value of explorations into knowing, Educational Psychologist, 55, 3, pp. 167-180, (2020); Chinn, Clark A., Education for a “Post-Truth” World: New Directions for Research and Practice, Educational Researcher, 50, 1, pp. 51-60, (2021); Damşa, Crina I., Shared epistemic agency: An empirical study of an emergent construct, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 19, 2, pp. 143-186, (2010); Knowledge and Interaction A Synthetic Agenda for the Learning Sciences, (2016); Data Feminism, (2020)","Chinn, C.; Tan, E.; Chan, C.; Kali, Y.","International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS)","18149316","9780990355038; 9781732467217; 9780990355090; 9781737330646; 9781737330615; 9781737330639; 9781732467200; 9781737330653; 9780990355014; 9780990355052","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132582143"

Since the 1990s, Indian software firms have developed expertise in carrying out outsourced back-office tasks and mid-level IT services like data entry, managing call centres, and performing software quality testing for foreign companies taking advantage of a technically trained local workforce. The trend of automating manual work practices in the IT industry has generated a different kind of demand for data sciences directed at upskilling and job readiness. India is witnessing a market-oriented groundswell of data science and IT skill tutoring ‘shops’, resituating science and engineering education. In this chapter we report from ethnographic research conducted in two IT skill training parks to underpin arguments about emerging neo-educational learning structures suited to a data science education for new livelihood opportunities in an IT-accredited India. Our chapter makes a case for looking at ‘data studies’ from an ethnographic perspective uncovering a ‘program’ of upward mobility through IT skilling and employment. What directions might data studies about tutoring data science skills in the Indian context lead to?

This growth has resulted in straining program resources at many institutions and causing concern about how to most effectively respond to the rapidly growing demand and provide equal opportunities for all students to pursue their degree. The primary goal of this work is to provide an intelligent solution to automatically identify biases related to race and gender in the content of Data Science related courses such as Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Mining, Data Analytics, and Knowledge Discovery just to name a few. While machine learning allows to build powerful predicting tools, it hasn't been used sufficiently to detect biases rooted in gender and race in educational material. Hence, using effective machine learning techniques we aim to enhance the success rate of undergraduate students in Data Science education and programs while promoting engagement through identifying and mitigating potential gender and racial biases. To this end, we propose a novel bias detection approach which uses a combination of gender identification and sentiment classification for characterization of gender and race in educational contents. Our proposed framework can help educators and course developers to mitigate race and gender biases in their course materials and create an equitable learning experience for students of minority and under-represented groups.","Data Science; Education; Gender And Racial Equity; Machine Learning; Curricula; Data Analytics; Data Mining; Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing Systems; Students; Data Analytics; Educational Materials; Equal Opportunity; Gender And Racial Equity; Gender Bias; Growing Demand; Intelligent Solutions; Machine Learning Techniques; Machine-learning; Undergraduate Degrees; Data Science","Curricula; Data Analytics; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Students; Data analytics; Educational materials; Equal opportunity; Gender and racial equity; Gender bias; Growing demand; Intelligent solutions; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Undergraduate degrees; Data Science","","Unsupervised Discovery of Implicit Gender Bias, (2020); Intel Com, (2019); Cheryan, Sapna, Ambient Belonging: How Stereotypical Cues Impact Gender Participation in Computer Science, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 97, 6, pp. 1045-1060, (2009); International Journal of Innovative Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, (2017); Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Abusive Language Online, (2019); Kingma, Diederik P., Adam: A method for stochastic optimization, (2015); Dinan, Emily, Multi-dimensional gender bias classification, pp. 314-331, (2020); Gendered Words Dataset; Ethayarajh, Kawin, Understanding undesirable word embedding associations, pp. 1696-1705, (2020); Stem Education Just the News, (2021)","Jemni, M.; Kallel, I.; Akkari, A.","IEEE Computer Society","21659559; 21659567","9781467386333; 9781479931910; 9781538629574; 9781479919086; 9781467361101; 9798350394023; 9781728184784; 9781509054671; 9781538695067; 9781728109305","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130418653"

In this article, we reflect on JSDSE’s relevance to K-12 education and how it might increase its influence in this area. We characterize JSDSE’s K-12 impact partially in terms of its ability to foster statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT). We also introduce a new construct, statistical knowledge for the transformation of teaching (SKT (Formula presented.), to more fully capture the K-12 contributions JSDSE can make. Our analysis draws upon the perspectives of an experienced high school teacher (the first author) and a statistics education researcher (the second author). The first author of the article surveyed recent JSDSE issues to identify and reflect upon articles with implications for his teaching practice. The second author framed the first author’s article reflections in terms of their connections to SKT and SKT2. Drawing upon our collaborative analysis, we propose strategies to help JSDSE more fully realize its potential to contribute to SKT and SKT2. We explain how acting on the proposed strategies may help JSDSE readers, authors, and editors bridge the persistent historical gap between formal scholarship and practice in K-12 education.","Assessment; Curriculum; Education; Pedagogical Content Knowledge; Professional Development; Statistical Knowledge For Teaching","","","Using Statistics Effectively in Mathematics Education Research, (2007); Arnold, Pip, What Makes a Good Statistical Question?, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 29, 1, pp. 122-130, (2021); Journal of Statistics Education, (1993); Ashley, Charlie, “Short Stories”: Reflections on Tom Short’s Impact on Statistics Education, Journal of Statistics Education, 27, 3, pp. 138-146, (2019); Pre K 12 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education II Gaise II, (2020); Brisbin, Abra G., Reading Versus Doing: Methods of Teaching Problem-Solving in Introductory Statistics, Journal of Statistics Education, 27, 3, pp. 154-170, (2019); Burke, Jonathan L., Teaching the Complexity of Dependence With the Triplet Game, Journal of Statistics Education, 28, 3, pp. 326-333, (2020); Campbell, Harlan, Twin Data that Made a Big Difference, and that Deserve to be Better-Known and Used in Teaching, Journal of Statistics Education, 25, 3, pp. 131-136, (2017); AP Art and Design Course and Exam Description, (2020); Mathematics Teacher Learning and Teaching Pk 12, (2020)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","26939169","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129381499"

In this paper, we shall report strategy and development of the DS curriculum standards. Data science education and the development of data scientists are recognised to be quite important in both social and business contexts. The IPSJ DS curriculum standard is developed by integrating various related initiatives and has the following unique features. (1) The DS curriculum standard covers a wide range of related fields to ensure international compatibility through mapping to the ACM Data Science curriculum and the European EDISON Data Science Framework. (2) It collaborates with the IPSJ Data Scientist certification (under development) by referring to the Data Scientist skill checklist (assistant level) developed by the Data Scientist Society of Japan. (3) It clarifies the knowledge and skills required of students majoring in data science. (4) It assigns a time to each educational content so that the curriculum size becomes approximately 675 class hours (60 credits in the Japanese credit system). (5) It collaborates with the Model Curriculum for Mathematics, Data Science and AI Education (literacy level) developed by the Japan Inter-University Consortium for Mathematics and Data Science, supported by the Japanese government.","Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science; Curriculum Development; Data Management; Data Science; Data Scientist Certification; Software Engineering; Statistics; Artificial Intelligence; Curricula; Data Science; Education Computing; Software Engineering; Students; Business Contexts; Curriculum Development; Curriculum Standards; Data Scientist Certification; Educational Contents; Science Curriculum; Science Education; Social Context; Unique Features; University Levels; Information Management","Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Data Science; Education computing; Software engineering; Students; Business contexts; Curriculum development; Curriculum standards; Data scientist certification; Educational contents; Science curriculum; Science education; Social context; Unique features; University levels; Information management","Funding text 1: This research is supported by JSPS Kakenhi #20K03232.; Funding text 2: IPSJ has developed curriculum standards for computing education at the university level for nearly 30 years and has promoted a variety of activities related to computing education at the primary, secondary, high school, and university levels.

In this article, we assert that these discussions of teaching and learning must attend to the human dimensions of data work. Specifically, we draw from several established lines of research to argue that practices involving the creation and manipulation of data are shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural tools and practices, and political concerns. We demonstrate through two examples how our proposed humanistic stance highlights ways that efforts to make data personally relevant for youth also necessarily implicate cultural and sociopolitical dimensions that affect the design and learning opportunities in data-rich learning environments. We offer an interdisciplinary framework based on literature from multiple bodies of educational research to inform design, teaching and research for more effective, responsible, and inclusive student learning experiences with and about data.","Case Studies; Computers And Learning; Curriculum; Data Literacy; Data Science; Mathematics Education; Science Education; Technology","","","Education, (2007); Azevedo, Flávio S., Lines of practice: A practice-centered theory of interest relationships, Cognition and Instruction, 29, 2, pp. 147-184, (2011); Bang, Megan, Desettling expectations in science education, Human Development, 55, 5-6, pp. 302-318, (2012); Pre K 12 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education II Gaise II, (2020); International Handbook of Research in Medical Education, (2002); Berman, Francine, Realizing the potential of data science, Communications of the ACM, 61, 4, pp. 67-72, (2018); Science Teacher, (2011); Oversold and Underused Computers in the Classroom, (2001); Optimizing Stem Education with Advanced Icts and Simulations, (2017); Duschl, Richard A., Science education in three-part harmony: Balancing conceptual, epistemic, and social learning goals, Review of Research in Education, 32, pp. 268-291, (2008)","","SAGE Publications Inc.","0013189X","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115638511"

What does the end-to-end workflow of a data scientist's collaboration with clients look like throughout the lifetime of a project? To investigate this question, we interviewed ten data scientists (5 female, 4 male, 1 non-binary) in diverse roles across industry and academia. We discovered that they work with clients in a six-stage outer-loop workflow, which involves 1) laying groundwork by building trust before a project begins, 2) orienting to the constraints of the client's environment, 3) collaboratively framing the problem, 4) bridging the gap between data science and domain expertise, 5) the inner loop of technical data analysis work, 6) counseling to help clients emotionally cope with analysis results. This novel outer-loop workflow contributes to CSCW by expanding the notion of what collaboration means in data science beyond the widely-known inner-loop technical workflow stages of acquiring, cleaning, analyzing, modeling, and visualizing data. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for data science education, parallels to design work, and unmet needs for tool development.","Collaborative Work; Data Science; Interview Study; Client Needs; Collaborative Work; Domain Expertise; End To End; Inner Loops; Interview Study; Non-binary; Outer Loop; Six Stages; Work-flows; Data Science","Client needs; Collaborative Work; Domain expertise; End to end; Inner loops; Interview study; Non-binary; Outer loop; Six stages; Work-flows; Data Science","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. NSF IIS-1845900.","Alspaugh, Sara, Futzing and Moseying: Interviews with Professional Data Analysts on Exploration Practices, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 25, 1, pp. 22-31, (2019); Review of Data Management Lifecycle Models, (2012); Blomkvist, Johan Kaj, Communication through boundary objects in distributed agile teams, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, 2015-April, pp. 1875-1884, (2015); Bross, Irwin D.J., The role of the statistician: Scientist or shoe clerk, American Statistician, 28, 4, pp. 126-127, (1974); Choi, Joohee, Characteristics of collaboration in the emerging practice of open data analysis, pp. 835-846, (2017); Perspectives on Socially Shared Cognition, (1991); Basics of Qualitative Research Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory, (1998); Berg, (2011); Cross, Nigel G., Expertise in Professional Design, pp. 372-388, (2018); There are Two Types of Data Scientists and Two Types of Problems to Solve, (2017)","","Association for Computing Machinery","25730142","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117890065"

In invoking exponential growth, mathematical modelling, statistical analysis, and the like, these data visualizations invite opportunities for mathematics teaching and learning. Yet data visualizations are social texts, authored from specific points of view, that narrate particular, and often consequential, stories. Their fundamental reliance on quantification and mathematics cements their social positioning as supposedly objective, reliable, and neutral. The reading of any data visualization demands unpacking the role of mathematics, including how data and variables have been formatted and how relationships are framed to narrate stories from particular points of view. We present an approach to a critical reading of data visualizations for the context of mathematics education that draws on three interrelated concepts: mathematical formatting (what gets quantified, measured, and how), framing (how variables are related and through what kind of data visualization), and narrating (which stories the data visualization tells, its potential impacts and limits). This approach to reading data visualisations includes a process of reimagining through reformatting, reframing and renarrating. We illustrate this approach and these three concepts using data visualizations published in the New York Times in 2020 about COVID-19. We offer a set of possible questions to guide a critical reading of data visualizations, beyond this set of examples.","Covid-19; Critical Mathematics Education; Critical Pedagogy; Data Science Education; Data Visualizations; Graph Reading","","","Adam, David, A guide to R - the pandemic's misunderstood metric, Nature, 583, 7816, pp. 346-348, (2020); For the Learning of Mathematics, (1995); New York Times, (2020); For the Learning of Mathematics, (1981); Ben-Zvi, Dani, Junior high school students' construction of global views of data and data representations, Educational Studies in Mathematics, 45, 1-3, pp. 35-65, (2001); Börner, Katy, Data visualization literacy: Definitions, conceptual frameworks, exercises, and assessments, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 116, 6, pp. 1857-1864, (2019); Boyd, Danah Michele, Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon, Information Communication and Society, 15, 5, pp. 662-679, (2012); Critical Inquiry, (1991); Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, (1984); Socarxiv, (2020)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","00131954; 15730816","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117034454"

Initial work in a quasi-experimental setting suggests that explicitly designing for experiences of failure leads to better learning outcomes than designing for success. We build on this to report on a controlled experimental study where students are exposed to failure-driven, success-driven, or no explicit scaffolding in problem-solving prior to instruction. For assessments of non-isomorphic conceptual understanding, our results align with those from prior work. Despite the similarity in posttest scores, students exposed to failure-driven scaffolding demonstrate higher quality of constructive reasoning than those receiving success-driven scaffolding. Additionally, our study reveals learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding (for both posttest scores and reasoning quality) on assessments of transfer. Several cognitive, affective and meta-cognitive mechanisms are investigated to explain robust learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding in preparatory problem-solving.","Data Science Education; Failure; Higher Education; Problem-based Learning; Scaffolding","","","Ackerman, Rakefet A., Meta-Reasoning: Monitoring and Control of Thinking and Reasoning, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 21, 8, pp. 607-617, (2017); Aleven, Vincent A.W.M.M., An adaptive coach for invention activities, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10331 LNAI, pp. 3-14, (2017); Aleven, Vincent A.W.M.M., INSTRUCTION BASED ON ADAPTIVE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES, pp. 522-559, (2016); Aleven, Vincent A.W.M.M., Help Seeking and Help Design in Interactive Learning Environments, Review of Educational Research, 73, 3, pp. 277-320, (2003); Bjork, Robert A., Self-regulated learning: Beliefs, techniques, and illusions, Annual Review of Psychology, 64, pp. 417-444, (2013); Brand, Serge, How do we learn in a negative mood?

We discuss a proposal for the stealth development of computational skills in students' exposure to introductory data science through careful, scaffolded exposure to computation and its power. Our intent is to support students, regardless of interest and self-efficacy in coding, in becoming data-driven learners, who are capable of asking complex questions about the world around them, and then answering those questions through the use of data-driven inquiry. Reference is made to the computer science and statistics consensus curriculum frameworks the International Data Science in Schools Project (IDSSP) recently published for secondary school data science or introductory tertiary programs, designed to optimize data-science accessibility.","Accessibility; Computational Thinking; Data Science Education; Statistical Thinking; Statistics Education; Teaching Statistics","","","How Learning Works Seven Research Based Principles for Smart Teaching, (2010); 2014 Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Statistical Science, (2014); Anscombe, Frank J., Graphs in statistical analysis, American Statistician, 27, 1, pp. 17-21, (1973); Investigate Time Series Data, (2020); Cetinkaya-Rundel, Mine, A Fresh Look at Introductory Data Science, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 29, S1, pp. S16-S26, (2021); Connolly, Cornelia, Programming anxiety amongst computing students - A key in the retention debate?, IEEE Transactions on Education, 52, 1, pp. 52-56, (2009); Cowan, Nelson, Processing limits of selective attention and working memory: Potential implications for interpreting, Interpreting, 5, 2, pp. 117-146, (2000); Cowan, Nelson, The magical number 4 in short-term memory: A reconsideration of mental storage capacity, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 24, 1, pp. 87-114, (2001); Donoho, David L., 50 Years of Data Science, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 26, 4, pp. 745-766, (2017); Inzightplots Graphical Tools for Exploring Data with Inzight R Package Version 2 13 2021","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","0141982X; 14679639","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108569468"

Data science is a new and interdisciplinary STEM-oriented domain, integrating knowledge and skills from computer science, mathematics, and statistics with an application domain, from which the data draw their context and meaning. Data science applications are relevant for various domains, and therefore, a variety of populations are increasingly attracted to learning it. Addressing the theme of the conference, i.e., 'Women in Engineering', in this paper we describe a data science workshop for social sciences and digital humanities researchers. A significant majority (83%) of the participants of this workshop self-identified as women. This gender proportion, the opposite of that prevailing in STEM studies, led us to examine the workshop from a gender perspective. Our results indicate that the women participating in the data science workshop perceived it as an opportunity to acquire research tools rather than programming tools. We suggest that framing the workshop as a research tool workshop and not as a programming workshop reduced prevalent gender barriers in STEM, encouraging a majority of women researchers to participate. In this paper, we elaborate on the participants' perceptions about data science and programming and analyze them based on three theoretical perspectives: expectancy value theory, the interdisciplinary perspective, and the epistemological perspective.","Data Science; Data Science Education; Gender Balance; Interdisciplinary Of Data Science; Engineering Education; Population Statistics; Professional Aspects; Stem (science, Technology, Engineering And Mathematics); Digital Humanities; Expectancy-value Theory; Oriented Domains; Programming Tools; Science , Technology , Engineering And Mathematics; Science Applications; Science Workshops; Women In Engineering; Data Science","Engineering education; Population statistics; Professional aspects; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Digital humanities; Expectancy-value theory; Oriented domains; Programming tools; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Science applications; Science workshops; Women in engineering; Data Science","This research is conducted with the generous support of The Bernard M.

Data Science is becoming a new recognised field of science that leverages the Data Analytics methods with the power of the Big Data technologies and Cloud Computing that both provide a basis for effective use of the data driven research and economy models. Data Science research and education require a multi-disciplinary approach and data driven/centric paradigm shift. Besides core professional competences and knowledge in Data Science, increasing digitalisation of Science and Industry also requires new type of workplace and professional skills that rise the importance of critical thinking, problem solving and creativity required to work in highly automated and dynamic environment. The education and training of the data related professions must reflect all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science and handling practitioners in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple forms, also providing sufficient lab facilities for practical training. This paper discusses aspects of building customizable and interoperable Data Science curricula for different types of learners and target application domains. The proposed approach is based on using the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) initially developed in the EU funded Project EDISON and currently being maintained by the EDISON Community Initiative.","Big Data; Curriculum Design; Data Science; Data Science Body Of Knowledge; Data Science Competences Framework; Data Science Model Curriculum; Data Scientist Professional; Edison Data Science Framework (edsf); Fair Principles In Open Education; Data Analytics; Data Science; Engineering Education; Industrial Economics; Life Cycle; Dynamic Environments; Education And Training; Multi-disciplinary Approach; Practical Training; Professional Competence; Professional Skills; Science Curriculum; Target Application; Data Handling","Data Analytics; Data Science; Engineering education; Industrial economics; Life cycle; Dynamic environments; Education and training; Multi-disciplinary approach; Practical training; Professional competence; Professional skills; Science curriculum; Target application; Data handling","The research leading to these results has received funding from the Horizon2020 projects FAIRsFAIR (grant number 831558), MATES (grant number 591889) and EDISON (grant n. 675419).","Edison Data Science Framework Edsf; Data Science Competence Framework; Data Science Body of Knowledge; Data Science Model Curriculum; Data Science Professional Profiles; 1st IEEE STC Cc and Rda Workshop on Curricula and Teaching Methods in Cloud Computing Big Data and Data Science in Proc the 6th IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Cloudcom2014, (2014); Proc the 7th IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Cloudcom2015, (2015); Proc the 8th IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Cloudcom2016, (2016); Demchenko, Yuri S., Customisable data science educational environment: From competences management and curriculum design to virtual labs on-demand, Proceedings of the International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science, CloudCom, 2017-December, pp. 363-368, (2017); Fourth Industrial Revolution, (2016)","Klinger, T.; Kollmitzer, C.; Pester, A.","IEEE Computer Society","21659559; 21659567","9781467386333; 9781479931910; 9781538629574; 9781479919086; 9781467361101; 9798350394023; 9781728184784; 9781509054671; 9781538695067; 9781728109305","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112447419"

Our work presents a first step in this direction, by leveraging the coding metrics from traditional software engineering (Halstead Volume and Cyclomatic Complexity) in combination with those that reflect a data science project's learning objectives (number of library calls and number of common library calls with the solution code). Through these metrics, we examined the code submissions of 97 students across two semesters of an introductory data science course. Our results indicated that the metrics can identify cases where students had overly complicated codes and would benefit from scaffolding feedback. The number of library calls, in particular, was also a significant predictor of changes in submission score and submission runtime, which highlights the distinctive nature of data science programming. We conclude with suggestions for extending our analyses towards more actionable intervention strategies, for example by tracking the fine-grained submission grading outputs throughout a student's submission history, to better model and support them in their data science learning process.","Coding Metrics; Data Science Education; Linear Mixed Model; Programming Analysis; Education Computing; Grading; Learning Systems; Scaffolds; Software Engineering; Students; Academic Institutions; Automated Coding; Cyclomatic Complexity; Intervention Strategy; Learning Objectives; Science Education; Science Learning; Science Projects; Data Science","Education computing; Grading; Learning systems; Scaffolds; Software engineering; Students; Academic institutions; Automated coding; Cyclomatic complexity; Intervention strategy; Learning objectives; Science education; Science learning; Science projects; Data Science","","Radon; Anslow, Craig, Datathons: An experience report of data hackathons for data science education, pp. 615-620, (2016); ACM SIGCSE Bulletin, (2002); Brunner, Robert J., Teaching data science, Procedia Computer Science, 80, pp. 1947-1956, (2016); Data Science Thinking the Next Scientific Technological and Economic Revolution, (2018); Chidamber, Shyam R., A Metrics Suite for Object Oriented Design, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 20, 6, pp. 476-493, (1994); De Veaux, Richard D., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 15-30, (2017); Diana, Nicholas, An instructor dashboard for real-time analytics in interactive programming assignments, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 272-279, (2017); Difficulty and Complexity of Introductory Programming Problems, (2019); Effenberger, Tomáš, Measuring difficulty of introductory programming tasks, (2019)","","Association for Computing Machinery","","9781450385855; 9781450314398; 9781450396387; 9781450390019; 9781450390217; 9781450348270; 9781450381963; 9781450322485; 9781450348201; 9781450364454","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103893758"

The effort is led by members of a joint data science criteria subcommittee appointed by ABET's Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) and CSAB (the lead society for computing accreditation). Establishing data science accreditation criteria is a notable milestone in the maturing data science discipline, indicating the presence of an accepted body of knowledge, standards of practice, and ethical codes for practitioners. This position paper motivates the effort and discusses prior work towards defining data science education requirements. It describes the ongoing process for creating and obtaining approval of the accreditation criteria, and how feedback was and will be solicited from the computing and statistical communities. The current draft data science criteria, which was approved in July 2020 by the relevant ABET bodies for a year of public review and comment, is presented. These criteria emphasize the three pillars of data science: Computing foundations, mathematical/statistical foundations, and experience in at least one data application domain.

As an emerging interdisciplinary study field, data science curriculum is typically a collection of individual data science related courses from different schools and departments, most of which are teaching data science in a siloed fashion. Therefore, it is necessary to map the landscape of existing curricula and explore how academic libraries can collaborate and contribute to undergraduate data science education. In this study, we analyzed teaching content and topics of over 100 data science related courses at Purdue University to map the landscape and explore roles of academic libraries to support data science education curriculum. Our results indicate most existing courses focused on ‘hard-core’ scientific analytic principles, such as computer science, statistics, and domain-specific skills. Courses of data-oriented skills, such as data management, data ethics, and data communications were limited across disciplines. In addition, data science courses were more likely targeting STEM students at upper levels (3rd and 4th year students). Academic libraries can enrich data science education efforts, by supporting credit courses, certificate programs, and other co-curricular activities to provide learning opportunities to all students, particularly 1st and 2nd year students and non-STEM majors.","College; Curriculum; Data Ethics; Data Management; Data Science; Education; Libraries","","","Aasheim, Cheryl L., Data analytics vs. data science: A study of similarities and differences in undergraduate programs based on course descriptions, Journal of Information Systems Education, 26, 2, pp. 103-115, (2015); Adams, Joel C., Creating a balanced data science program, pp. 185-191, (2020); undefined, (2015); Anderson, Paul E., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, pp. 145-150, (2014); Antell, Karen, Dealing with data: Science librarians' participation in data management at association of research libraries institutions, College and Research Libraries, 75, 4, pp. 557-574, (2014); Rfid Journal, (2009); Baumer, Benjamin S., A Data Science Course for Undergraduates: Thinking With Data, American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 334-342, (2015); Berry, David M., Understanding digital humanities, pp. 1-318, (2012); BORGMAN, CHRISTINE L., The conundrum of sharing research data, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 63, 6, pp. 1059-1078, (2012); Burgoyne, Mary Beth, Beyond Embedded: Creating an Online-Learning Community Integrating Information Literacy and Composition Courses, Journal of Academic Librarianship, 41, 4, pp. 416-421, (2015)","","Elsevier Ltd","00991333","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100143048"

This has shifted major challenges in biological research from data generation and processing to interpretation and knowledge translation. However, postsecondary training in bioinformatics, or more generally data science for life scientists, lags behind current demand. In particular, development of accessible, undergraduate data science curricula has the potential to improve research and learning outcomes as well as better prepare students in the life sciences to thrive in public and private sector careers. Here, we describe the Experiential Data science for Undergraduate Cross-Disciplinary Education (EDUCE) initiative, which aims to progressively build data science competency across several years of integrated practice. Through EDUCE, students complete data science modules integrated into required and elective courses augmented with coordinated cocurricular activities. The EDUCE initiative draws on a community of practice consisting of teaching assistants (TAs), postdocs, instructors, and research faculty from multiple disciplines to overcome several reported barriers to data science for life scientists, including instructor capacity, student prior knowledge, and relevance to discipline-specific problems. Preliminary survey results indicate that even a single module improves student self-reported interest and/or experience in bioinformatics and computer science. Thus, EDUCE provides a flexible and extensible active learning framework for integration of data science curriculum into undergraduate courses and programs across the life sciences.","Bioinformatics; Curricula; Data Handling; Data Science; Mass Spectrometry; Students; Surveys; Biological Research; Cross-disciplinary; Data Driven; Disciplinary Education; High-throughput Sequencing; Life Scientists; Life-sciences; Modular Approach; Science Curriculum; Science Education; Metadata; Article; Bioinformatics; Biomedicine; Clinical Assessment Tool; Clinical Competence; Clinical Outcome; Clinical Practice; Community Practice; Coordination; Curriculum; Curriculum Development; Data Science; Disciplines Relating To Biomedicine; Health Care Delivery; Health Education; Immunology; Information Processing; Information System; Instructor Capacity; Integrated Practice; Interpersonal Communication; Knowledge; Knowledge Translation; Learning; Microbiology; Nonhuman; Practice Guideline; Preliminary Data; Public Health; Scientist; Self Report; Student Knowledge; Teaching; Translational Research; Undergraduate Cross-disciplinary Education; Workshop; Biology; British Columbia; Education; Educational Model; Human; Problem Based Learning; Student; University; Computational Biology; Curriculum; Faculty; Humans; Knowledge; Learning; Microbiology; Models, Educational; Problem-based Learning; Universities","Bioinformatics; Curricula; Data handling; Data Science; Mass spectrometry; Students; Surveys; Biological research; Cross-disciplinary; Data driven; Disciplinary education; High-throughput sequencing; Life scientists; Life-sciences; Modular approach; Science curriculum; Science education; Metadata; Article; bioinformatics; biomedicine; clinical assessment tool; clinical competence; clinical outcome; clinical practice; community practice; coordination; curriculum; curriculum development; data science; disciplines relating to biomedicine; health care delivery; health education; immunology; information processing; information system; instructor capacity; integrated practice; interpersonal communication; knowledge; knowledge translation; learning; microbiology; nonhuman; practice guideline; preliminary data; public health; scientist; self report; student knowledge; teaching; translational research; Undergraduate Cross-Disciplinary Education; workshop; biology; British Columbia; education; educational model; human; problem based learning; student; university; Computational Biology; Curriculum; Faculty; Humans; Knowledge; Learning; Microbiology; Models, Educational; Problem-Based Learning; Universities","","Hahn, Aria S., The information science of microbial ecology, Current Opinion in Microbiology, 31, pp. 209-216, (2016); Fourth Paradigm Data Intensive Scientific Discovery, (2009); Stephens, Zachary D., Big data: Astronomical or genomical?, PLOS Biology, 13, 7, (2015); MacLean, M., Swift action needed to close the skills gap in bioinformatics [1], Nature, 401, 6748, (1999); Attwood, Teresa K., A global perspective on evolving bioinformatics and data science training needs, Briefings in Bioinformatics, 20, 2, pp. 398-404, (2019); Horton, Nicholas Jon, Teaching the Next Generation of Statistics Students to “Think With Data”: Special Issue on Statistics and the Undergraduate Curriculum, American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 259-265, (2015); Women Minorities and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering, (2019); Howlett, John, Progressive Education: A critical introduction, pp. 1-306, (2013); Freeman, Scott, Active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 111, 23, pp. 8410-8415, (2014); Williams, Jason J., A vision for collaborative training infrastructure for bioinformatics, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1387, 1, pp. 54-60, (2017)","","Public Library of Science","1553734X; 15537358","","","33630850","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102096824"

Much of the attention has been on the application of AI principles and techniques, especially machine learning, natural language processing and predictive analytics. While AI is only one phase in the data science ecosystem, we must embrace a fuller range of job roles that help manage AI algorithms and systems | from the AI innovators and architects (in CS, Math and Statistics) to the AI technicians and specialists (in CS, IT and IS). Also, it's important that we better understand the current state of the low participation and representation of minoritized groups that further sties the accessibility and inclusion efforts. However, how we learn and what we learn is highly dependent on who we are as learners. In this paper, we examine demographic disparities by race/ethnicity and gender within the information systems educational infrastructure from an evaluative perspective. More specifically, we adopt intersectional methods and apply the theory of public value failure to identify learning gaps in the fast-growing field of data science. National datasets of Master's and Doctoral graduate students in IS, CS, Math and Statistics are used to create an \institutional parity score"" which calculates field-specific representation by race/ethnicity and gender in data science related fields. We conclude by showcasing bias creep including the situational exclusion of individuals from access to the broader information economy, be it access to technologies and data or access to participate in the data workforce or data enabled-economic activity.

Tim Brown, president, and CEO of IDEO, defines design thinking as “A human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success”. The application of design thinking has been witnessed to be the road to develop innovative applications, interactive systems, scientific software, healthcare application, and even to utilize Design Thinking to re-think business operation as the case of Airbnb. Recently, there has been a movement to apply design thinking to machine learning and artificial intelligence to ensure creating the “waw” affect to consumers. ACM Taskforce on Data Science program states that “Data Scientists should be able to implement and understand algorithms for data collection and analysis. They should understand the time and space considerations of algorithms.

Yet it can be a challenge to fit the teaching of such skills into the data science curriculum. Team-Based Learning (TBL) is a pedagogical strategy that can help educators teach data science better by flipping the classroom to employ small-group collaborative learning to actively engage students in doing data science. A consequence of this teaching method is helping students achieve the workforce-relevant data science learning goals of effective communication, teamwork, and collaboration. We describe the essential elements of TBL: accountability structures and feedback mechanisms to support students collaborating within permanent teams on well-designed application exercises to do data science. The results of our case study of using TBL to teach a modern, introductory data science course indicate that the course effectively taught reproducible data science workflows, beginning R programming, and communication and collaboration. Students also reported much room for improvement in their learning of statistical thinking and advanced R concepts. To help the data science education community adopt this appealing pedagogical strategy, we outline steps for deciding on using TBL, preparing and planning for it, and overcoming potential pitfalls when using TBL to teach data science.","Collaboration; Cooperative Learning; R Programming; Small-group Learning; Statistical Thinking; Tidyverse","","This work was partially funded by NSF Division of Undergraduate Education grant #2044384 for IUSE: Collaborative Data Science Education: Statistics With Integration of Technology, Computing, and the Humanities (CODE:SWITCH).

The model of the quantified self—in which data about one’s own activities are collected and made into objects of study—provides inspiration for one such approach. By drawing on what one already knows about their self and their prior experiences, it may be possible to bootstrap students’ abilities to interpret and make sense of data. Taking that possibility seriously, this article describes some of the gains observed in students’ statistical reasoning following a quantified self, wearables-based elementary statistics unit and provides a theoretical framework drawing from cognitive psychology, embodiment, and situative perspectives to characterize how prior experience is used as a resource in data sense-making when the data are about students’ own physical experiences. This framework centralizes and interrogates the work of “remembering” prior experiences and articulates how remembering is involved in interpreting quantified self data. Specifically, the framework emphasizes that remembering in service of data interpretation is a reconstructive act that draws from both general and specific embodied resources and that the work of reconstructive remembering in the classroom is both individual and multi-participant work. To demonstrate measured learning gains and illustrate the framework, written assessment results and descriptive cases of student and teacher discussions about quantified self data from two sixth-grade classes participating in a classroom design experiment are provided. Both a discussion of and recommendations for ethical considerations related to quantified self data in education are also provided.","","","This work was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation (US) under Grant No. DRL-1054280.

Many teachers’ preparation for and experiences teaching statistical modeling have focused on probabilistic models. Subsequently, much of the research literature related to the teachers’ understanding has focused on probabilistic models. This study explores the extent to which secondary statistics teachers appear to understand ideas of statistical modeling, specifically the processes of model building and evaluation, when introduced using classification trees, a type of algorithmic model. Results of this study suggest that while teachers were able to read and build classification tree models, they experienced more difficulty when evaluating models. Further research could continue to explore possible learning trajectories, technology tools, and pedagogical approaches for using classification trees to introduce ideas of statistical modeling.","Algorithmic Models; Classification Trees; Data Science Education; Statistical Modeling; Statistics Education Research; Teacher Development","","","Aquilonius, Birgit C., Students' reasoning about p-values, Statistics Education Research Journal, 14, 2, pp. 7-27, (2015); Bargagliotti, Anna E., Undergraduate Learning Outcomes for Achieving Data Acumen, Journal of Statistics Education, 28, 2, pp. 197-211, (2020); Exploring Probability in School Challenges for Teaching and Learning, (2005); Biehler, Rolf, Elementary preservice teachers' reasoning about modeling a ""family factory"" with Tinkerplots - A pilot study, Statistics Education Research Journal, 16, 2, pp. 244-286, (2017); Biembengut, Maria Salett, Mathematical modeling: Implications for teaching, pp. 481-490, (2010); Breiman, Leo, Statistical modeling: The two cultures, Statistical Science, 16, 3, pp. 199-215, (2001); Classification and Regression Trees, (1984); Brown, Emery Neal, Special section: statistical training and curricular revision what is statistics?, American Statistician, 63, 2, pp. 105-110, (2009); Case, Catherine, A framework to characterize student difficulties in learning inference from a simulation-based approach, Statistics Education Research Journal, 17, 2, pp. 9-29, (2018); Challenge of Developing Statistical Literacy Reasoning and Thinking, (2004)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","26939169","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108536469"

To address this demand, we created Data Science in Practice, a large-enrollment undergraduate course. Here, we present our goals for teaching this course, including: (1) conceptualizing data science as creative problem solving, with a focus on project-based learning, (2) prioritizing practical application, teaching and using standardized tools and best practices, and (3) scaling education through coursework that enables hands-on and classroom learning in a large-enrollment course. Throughout this course we also emphasize social context and data ethics to best prepare students for the interdisciplinary and impactful nature of their work.

Through analyzing the hosting departments, design principles, curriculum objectives, and curriculum design of existing programs, our findings reveal that (1) the data science field is inherently interdisciplinary and requires joint collaborations between various departments. Multi-department administration was one of the solutions to offer interdisciplinary training, but some problems have also been identified in its practical implementation; (2) data science education should emphasize hands-on practice and experiential learning opportunities to prepare students for data analysis and problem-solving in real-world contexts; and (3) although the importance of comprehensive coverage of various disciplines in data science curricula is widely acknowledged, how to achieve an effective balance between various disciplines and how to effectively integrate domain knowledge into the curriculum still remain open questions. Findings of this study can provide insights for the design and development of emerging undergraduate data science programs.","Curriculum Design; Data Science Education; Interdisciplinarity; Undergraduate; Curricula; Curriculum Designs; Design And Development; Experiential Learning; Hands-on Practice; Interdisciplinary Training; Science Curriculum; Semi Structured Interviews; Systematic Literature Review; Data Science","Curricula; Curriculum designs; Design and Development; Experiential learning; Hands-on practice; Interdisciplinary training; Science curriculum; Semi structured interviews; Systematic literature review; Data Science","Acknowledgments.

This emergence also extends to undergraduate education, whereby a growing number of institutions now offer degree programs in data science. However, there is considerable variation in what the field actually entails and, by extension, differences in how undergraduate programs prepare students for data-intensive careers. We used two seminal frameworks for data science education to evaluate undergraduate data science programs at a subset of 4-year institutions in the United States; developing and applying a rubric, we assessed how well each program met the guidelines of each of the frameworks. Most programs scored high in statistics and computer science and low in domain-specific education,ethics, and areas of communication. Moreover, the academic unit administering the degree program significantly influenced the course-load distribution of computer science and statistics/mathematics courses. We conclude that current data science undergraduate programs provide solid grounding in computational and statistical approaches, yet may not deliver sufficient context in terms of domain knowledge and ethical considerations necessary for appropriate data science applications. Additional refinement of the expectations for undergraduate data science education is warranted.","Computer Science; Curricula; Data Science; Education; Ethics; Machine Learning; Statistics; Application Programs; Curricula; Education Computing; Electric Grounding; Philosophical Aspects; Statistics; Students; Ethical Considerations; Interdisciplinary Fields; Load Distributions; Science Applications; Science Education; Statistical Approach; Undergraduate Education; Undergraduate Program; Data Science","Application programs; Curricula; Education computing; Electric grounding; Philosophical aspects; Statistics; Students; Ethical considerations; Interdisciplinary fields; Load distributions; Science applications; Science education; Statistical approach; Undergraduate education; Undergraduate program; Data Science","","Aasheim, Cheryl L., Data analytics vs. data science: A study of similarities and differences in undergraduate programs based on course descriptions, Journal of Information Systems Education, 26, 2, pp. 103-115, (2015); Anderson, Paul E., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, pp. 145-150, (2014); Anderson, Paul E., Data science as an undergraduate degree, pp. 705-706, (2014); Harvard Data Science Review, (2019); Bok, Derek C., Higher education in America, pp. 1-479, (2013); Ordinal Regression Models for Ordinal Data, (2012); Reuters, (2018); De Veaux, Richard D., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 15-30, (2017); American Sociological Review, (1983); Donoho, David L., 50 Years of Data Science, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 26, 4, pp. 745-766, (2017)","","PeerJ Inc.","23765992","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104803598"

In general, the processing related to the higher-order tensor is so complicated that we have been developing understanding support tools for it using 3D puzzles from the viewpoint of making students interested. However, although these tools have been tried by students in graduation studies and other some occasions, their introduction into lectures was one issue. Therefore, in this study, we developed a new programming exercise material for the higher-order tensor, which is supposed to be used in data science subjects, by using a 3D puzzle. This learning material is also composed of Microsoft Teams, and students can access the material remotely to learn programming. In this paper, several students actually tried this material. As a result, it was found that the students themselves could create and submit assignment reports by viewing explanatory videos and performing exercises. From this, it is expected that this material will be able to introduce to data science courses, including online use.","3d Puzzle; Data Science Education; Higher-order Tensor; Programing Materials; R; Remote Exercise","","This work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI (Grants-in Aid for Scientific Research) under Grant No. JP18K11596.","SIAM, (2007); Ishida, Akio, Solving 3-D puzzles using tensor decomposition and application to education of multidimensional data analysis, International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing, 8, 5, pp. 447-453, (2018); Proc the Annual Software Symposium in Kumamoto, (2019); Yamamoto, Naoki, Development of teaching tool for supporting understanding of tensor decomposition using macmahon’s coloured cubes, International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 10, 1, pp. 14-19, (2020); R Foundation for Statistical Computing, (2025); Shotoh Sugaku, (2019); On the 444 Cube Puzzle on P 60 of; undefined; de Lathauwer, Lieven, A multilinear singular value decomposition, SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 21, 4, pp. 1253-1278, (2000); Package Rtensor, (2015)","","International Journal of Information and Education Technology","20103689","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102281790"

As an interdisciplinary science it integrates knowledge and methods from computer science, mathematics and statistics, and the domain knowledge of the data. As data science is still forming as a domain, several points of view exist on how to teach data science. The curriculum of many undergraduate data science programs includes advanced knowledge and skills in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and one or more data domains. Several initiatives for designing high school data science curricula have emerged recently. Since it is unrealistic to teach all the above-mentioned advanced topics at the high school level, the high school data science curriculum focuses on a broad understanding of the data science workflow rather than on mathematical and algorithmic details that characterize undergraduate programs. High school computer science pupils, however, are expected to have a deep understanding of algorithms, as algorithms are the heart of computer science. In this paper, we present our attempt to adapt a data science course to computer science high school pupils that incorporates both a broad view on data science and data workflow, as well as deep understanding of data processing algorithms and specifically, machine learning. This course is taught for 10th grade computer science pupils in an Israeli public school, and was also taught in a summer workshop for computer science teachers.","Computer Science Education; Data Science Education; High School; Interdisciplinary; K12; Secondary Education; Curricula; Data Handling; Engineering Education; Equalizers; Machine Learning; Teaching; Computer Science Teachers; Data Processing Algorithms; Domain Knowledge; Interdisciplinary Fields; Science Curriculum; Science Programs; Summer Workshops; Undergraduate Program; Data Science","Curricula; Data handling; Engineering education; Equalizers; Machine learning; Teaching; Computer science teachers; Data processing algorithms; Domain knowledge; Interdisciplinary fields; Science curriculum; Science programs; Summer workshops; Undergraduate program; Data Science","","Anderson, Paul E., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, pp. 145-150, (2014); Berman, Francine, Realizing the potential of data science, Communications of the ACM, 61, 4, pp. 67-72, (2018); Blumenfeld, Phyllis C., Motivating Project-Based Learning: Sustaining the Doing, Supporting the Learning, Educational Psychologist, 26, 3-4, pp. 369-398, (1991); Bryant, Caelin, A middle-school camp emphasizing data science and computing for social good, pp. 358-364, (2019); Danyluk, Andrea Pohoreckyj, ACM task force on data science education draft report and opportunity for feedback, pp. 496-497, (2019); De Veaux, Richard D., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 15-30, (2017); Demchenko, Yuri S., EDISON data science framework: A foundation for building data science profession for research and industry, Proceedings of the International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science, CloudCom, 0, pp. 620-626, (2016); Dryer, Amber, A middle-school module for introducing data-mining, big-data, ethics and privacy using rapidminer and a Hollywood theme, 2018-January, pp. 753-758, (2018); Curriculum Frameworks for Introductory Data Science, (2025); Gal-Ezer, Judith, A High School Program in Computer Science, Computer, 28, 10, pp. 73-80, (1995)","","Association for Computing Machinery","","9781450385855; 9781450314398; 9781450396387; 9781450390019; 9781450390217; 9781450348270; 9781450381963; 9781450322485; 9781450348201; 9781450364454","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123040085"

Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis of research publications on data science was made of papers published in the Web of Science database to identify the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective. Findings: A content analysis of 80 publications is presented. The articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. The category of tools, techniques and applications of data science was most addressed by the authors, followed by data science from the perspective of health sciences, data science education and training and knowledge and skills of the data professional. However, several publications fell into several categories because these topics were closely related. Research limitations/implications: Only publication recorded in the Web of Science database and with the term “data science” in the topic area were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that either were related to other keywords such as “e-science”, “e-research”, “data service”, “data curation”, “research data management” or “scientific data management” or were not present in the Web of Science database.

In data sciences, there are two related but distinct strategies: hypothesis testing and binary classification. In practice, how to choose between these two strategies can be unclear and rather confusing. Here, we summarize key distinctions between these two strategies in three aspects and list five practical guidelines for data analysts to choose the appropriate strategy for specific analysis needs. We demonstrate the use of those guidelines in a cancer driver gene prediction example. In data science education, two analysis strategies, hypothesis testing and binary classification, are mostly covered in different courses and textbooks. In real data application, it can be puzzling whether a binary decision problem should be formulated as hypothesis testing or binary classification. This article aims to disentangle the puzzle for data science students and researchers by offering practical guidelines for choosing between the two strategies. Hypothesis testing and binary classification are two data analysis strategies taught mostly in different undergraduate classes and rarely compared with each other. As a result, which strategy is more appropriate for a specific real-world data analysis task is often ambiguous. To address this issue, this perspective article clarifies the distinctions between the two strategies and offers practical guidelines to the broad data science discipline.","Dsml 1: Concept: Basic Principles Of A New Data Science Output Observed And Reported; Data Handling; Industrial Research; Machine Learning; Testing; Analysis Strategies; Binary Classification; Hypothesis Testing; Practical Guidelines; Science Disciplines; Science Education; Scientific Researches; Statistical Hypothesis Testing; Data Science","Data handling; Industrial research; Machine learning; Testing; Analysis strategies; Binary classification; Hypothesis testing; Practical guidelines; Science disciplines; Science education; Scientific researches; Statistical hypothesis testing; Data Science","","Testing Statistical Hypotheses, (1986); Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective, (2012); All of Statistics A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, (2004); Distinguishing Between Two Groups in Statistics and Machine Learning Hypothesis Test Vs Classification Vs Clustering, (2016); Why is Binary Classification Not A Hypothesis Test, (2016); Liao, Shumin, Test-based classification: A linkage between classification and statistical testing, Statistics and Probability Letters, 77, 12, pp. 1269-1281, (2007); Arxiv, (2019); Efron, Bradley, Computer age statistical inference: Algorithms, evidence, and data science, pp. 1-475, (2016); Breiman, Leo, Statistical modeling: The two cultures, Statistical Science, 16, 3, pp. 199-215, (2001); Riley, Patrick F., Three pitfalls to avoid in machine learning, Nature, 572, 7767, pp. 27-29, (2019)","","Cell Press","26663899","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102966494"

Innovation, computation, and technological advances have now tremendously accelerated the pace of discovery, providing driverless cars, robotic devices, expert healthcare systems, precision medicine, and automated discovery to mention a few. Even though the definition of the term data science continues to evolve, the sweeping impact it has already produced on society is undeniable. We are at a point when new discoveries through data science have enormous potential to advance progress but also to be used maliciously, with harmful ethical and social consequences. Perhaps nowhere is this more clearly exemplified than in the biological and medical sciences. The confluence of (1) machine learning, (2) mathematical modeling, (3) computation/simulation, and (4) big data have moved us from the sequencing of genomes to gene editing and individualized medicine; yet, unsettled policies regarding data privacy and ethical norms could potentially open doors for serious negative repercussions. The data science revolution has amplified the urgent need for a paradigm shift in undergraduate biology education. It has reaffirmed that data science education interacts and enhances mathematical education in advancing quantitative conceptual and skill development for the new generation of biologists. These connections encourage us to strive to cultivate a broadly skilled workforce of technologically savvy problem-solvers, skilled at handling the unique challenges pertaining to biological data, and capable of collaborating across various disciplines in the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. To accomplish this, we suggest development of open curricula that extend beyond the job certification rhetoric and combine data acumen with modeling, experimental, and computational methods through engaging projects, while also providing awareness and deep exploration of their societal implications. This process would benefit from embracing the pedagogy of experiential learning and involve students in open-ended explorations derived from authentic inquiries and ongoing research. On this foundation, we encourage development of flexible data science initiatives for the education of life science undergraduates within and across existing models.","Big Data; Data Science Education; Education Reform; Mathematical Biology Education; Biology; Curriculum; Education; Human; Computational Biology; Curriculum; Data Science; Humans","biology; curriculum; education; human; Computational Biology; Curriculum; Data Science; Humans","The first author was partially supported by the Karl Peace Fellowship in Mathematics, Randolph-Macon College, VA.

This paper contributes to the literature on data science education by examining the sociotechnical practices of data wrangling—strategies for selecting and managing large, aggregated datasets to produce a model and story. We examined the learning opportunities related to data wrangling practices by investigating youth’s talk-in-interaction while assembling models and stories about family migration using interactive data visualization tools and large socioeconomic datasets. We first identified ten sociotechnical practices that characterize youth’s interaction with tools and collaboration in data wrangling. We then suggest four categories of activities to describe patterns of learning related to the practices, including addressing missing data, understanding data aggregation, exploring social or historical events that constitute the formation of data patterns, and varying data visual encoding for storytelling. These practices and activities are important to understand for supporting future data science education opportunities that facilitate learning and discussion about scientific and socioeconomic issues. This study also sheds light on how the family migration modeling context positions the youth as having agency and authority over the data and contributes to the design of CSCL environments that tackle the challenges of data wrangling.","Data Visualization; Data Wrangling; Family Migration; Modeling; Sociotechnical Practices; Storytelling","","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number 1341882.

As a result, new data science education programs are opening at a growing rate. Over the past few years, several papers on data science programs were published, focusing on their curricular aspects. The pedagogy of those programs, however, has received only little attention. To partially close this gap, my doctoral research focuses on the pedagogical aspects of data science. The pilot phase of the research was carried out in graduate, undergraduate, and high school data science programs. The results of the pilot research are organized by a framework of ten challenges of data science education whose purpose is to improve our understanding of the pedagogical challenges of data science education for various populations and to develop pedagogical methods for coping with them. The current stage of research aims to validate this framework.","Computer Science Education; Data Science Education; Population Statistics; Computational Resources; Doctoral Research; Pedagogical Aspects; Pedagogical Method; Radical Growth; Research Focus; Science Education; Science Programs; Data Science","Population statistics; Computational resources; Doctoral research; Pedagogical aspects; Pedagogical method; Radical growth; Research focus; Science education; Science programs; Data Science","","Berman, Francine, Realizing the potential of data science, Communications of the ACM, 61, 4, pp. 67-72, (2018); Raj, Rajendra K., Data science education: Global perspectives and convergence, Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE, pp. 265-266, (2019); Anderson, Paul E., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, pp. 145-150, (2014); Danyluk, Andrea Pohoreckyj, ACM task force on data science education draft report and opportunity for feedback, pp. 496-497, (2019); De Veaux, Richard D., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 15-30, (2017); Havill, Jessen T., Embracing the liberal arts in an interdisciplinary data analytics program, pp. 9-14, (2019); Tartaro, Andrea, Computer scientists at the biology lab bench, pp. 120-125, (2015); Khuri, Sami, Increasing the capacity of STEM workforce: Minor in bioinformatics, pp. 315-320, (2017); Introductory Data Science, (2019); Proceedings of the 18th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research, (2018)","","Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org 2 Penn Plaza, Suite 701 New York NY 10121-0701","","9781450370929","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092130901"

Recent news stories about data breaches and algorithmic biases indicate that big data projects raise ethical concerns with the potential to inflict harm on a wide societal or global scale. In this paper, we address three main research questions: (1) what curricular recommendations have been proposed for the teaching of ethics in undergraduate data science courses, (2) what codes of ethics are relevant to data science, and (3) how can we characterize the proposed codes to help an educator choose which to include in a data science course? We conclude with an overview of an approach to teaching ethics in undergraduate data science courses.","Philosophical Aspects; Teaching; Ethical Concerns; Ethics Education; Global Scale; Research Questions; Science Course; Science Education; Science Programs; Teaching Ethics; Data Science","Philosophical aspects; Teaching; Ethical concerns; Ethics education; Global scale; Research questions; Science course; Science education; Science programs; Teaching ethics; Data Science","2.1 National Science Foundation (NSF)","Realizing the Potential of Data Science Final Report from the National Science Foundation Computer and Information Science and Engineering Advisory Committee Data Science Working Group, (2016); Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Data Science Annual Review of Statistics, (2016); Draft Curriculum Framework Abbreviated Topics List; Data Science Leadership Summit Summary Report, (2018); Data Science Ethics Resources; Envisioning the Data Science Discipline the Undergraduate Perspective Interim Report, (2018); Ethical Reasoning in Big Data an Exploratory Analysis, (2016); Data4democracy Ethics Principles; Oxford Munich Code of Conduct Code of Conduct for Professional Data Scientists; Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice","","American Society for Engineering Education","21535965","9780878232413","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095737074"

Students of Data Science area usually face the difficulty of understanding the complex of real-time data and sophisticated statistical indicators and models. Another difficulty is students are easy to lost interests and patience during the process of learning programming and analysis process, such as R-language. Stock market, as a huge data source and an important data disciplinary, is comparatively easy to attract student attentions. Thus, we developed an intuitive trading platform for education purpose. The platform contains three components: an exploring window, a control windows and a report window. The exploring window shows current and historical stock price trends and related indicators. Several representative stocks from different sectors can be picked and specific time frames can be assigned. The control window allows students to develop their own trading strategies. A trading strategy can be created by either intuitive way, or through single or combinations of indicators, or be built generically though plug-in R-programing module. The report window demonstrates the expected return of a stock in a specific time frame through a specific strategy. A more comprehensive report with detailed transaction information is also provided for back-testing purpose. Students are involved into the development of the software and get experience for R-programming. Preliminary version of the product has been tested and surveyed in a data science classroom. About ten junior Data Science students have practiced and provided feedback. The positive survey results show the feasibility of the approach. In the future, artificial intelligent component will be integrated into the platform.","Data Science; R-programming; Trading Platform; Commerce; Data Science; Education Computing; Electronic Trading; Financial Markets; Surveys; Analysis Process; Artificial Intelligent; Process Of Learning; Science Classroom; Science Education; Statistical Indicators; Trading Strategies; Transaction Information; Students","Commerce; Data Science; Education computing; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Surveys; Analysis process; Artificial intelligent; Process of learning; Science classroom; Science education; Statistical indicators; Trading strategies; Transaction information; Students","","undefined, (2017); Wall Street Journal, (2017); undefined, (2017); Machine Learning for Stock Trading Strategies, (2016); undefined, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9781728170077","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092489291"

Although extracurricular efforts already exist for many computationally intensive disciplines, their support of data science education has significantly helped in coping with the speed of innovation in data science practice and formal curricula. While the proliferation of ad hoc efforts is an indication of their popularity, less has been documented about the needs that they are designed to meet, the limitations that they face, and practical suggestions for holding successful efforts. To holistically understand the role of different ad hoc formats for data science, we surveyed organizers of ad hoc data science education efforts to understand how organizers perceived the events to have gone-including areas of strength and areas requiring growth. We also gathered recommendations from these past events for future organizers. Our results suggest that the perceived benefits of ad hoc efforts go beyond developing technical skills and may provide continued benefit in conjunction with formal curricula, which warrants further investigation. As increasing numbers of researchers from computational fields with a history of complex data become involved with ad hoc efforts to share their skills, the lessons learned that we extract from the surveys will provide concrete suggestions for the practitioner-leaders interested in creating, improving, and sustaining future efforts.","Curricula; Surveys; Ad Hoc Datum; Complex Data; Computational Field; Perceived Benefits; Science Education; Technical Skills; Data Science; Article; Data Science; Education; Human; Human Experiment; Leadership; Physician; Skill; Curriculum; Procedures; Questionnaire; Curriculum; Humans; Surveys And Questionnaires","Curricula; Surveys; Ad hoc datum; Complex data; Computational field; Perceived benefits; Science education; Technical skills; Data Science; article; data science; education; human; human experiment; leadership; physician; skill; curriculum; procedures; questionnaire; Curriculum; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires","","Computing Research News, (2018); Cao, Longbing, Data science: A comprehensive overview, ACM Computing Surveys, 50, 3, (2018); Allen, Gabrielle D., A practical and comprehensive graduate course preparing students for research involving scientific computing, Procedia Computer Science, 4, pp. 1927-1936, (2011); Atwood, Teresa K., GOBLET: The Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training, PLOS Computational Biology, 11, 4, (2015); Baumer, Benjamin S., A Data Science Course for Undergraduates: Thinking With Data, American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 334-342, (2015); Cetinkaya-Rundel, Mine, Infrastructure and Tools for Teaching Computing Throughout the Statistical Curriculum, American Statistician, 72, 1, pp. 58-65, (2018); Proceedings of the 13th Python in Science Conference, (2014); Big Data Factories, (2017); Jacobs, Christian T., Experiences with efficient methodologies for teaching computer programming to geoscientists, Journal of Geoscience Education, 64, 3, pp. 183-198, (2016); Millman, K.

First, it crops the tables and recognizes the templates. Second, it classifies the column names and row names into ""method"", ""dataset"", or ""evaluation metric"", and then unified all the table cells into (method, dataset, metric, score)-quadruples.

Project-based learning (PBL) is a well-known pedagogical tool for interdisciplinary education. In order to successfully accomplish interdisciplinary learning, students must have sufficient knowledge in each of the separate disciplines. Use of cross-disciplinary teams, for example, is one way to make sure a project team includes specialists in all required disciplines. This, however, is not always the case. In many cases, there are significant knowledge gaps within the project team in one or more of the project domains. Specifically, in our case, fourth-year electrical engineering students are working in pairs on biomedical signal processing projects, which are evidently interdisciplinary in nature. The teams, however, are homogeneous and the students lack the essential medical expertise required to achieve solutions applicable by physicians. Furthermore, students tend to acknowledge this gap only in the advanced phases of the project, and so critical phases, such as goal setting and planning, are performed without the required knowledge. In this article, we present (a) data that supports the existence of this knowledge gap and its effect on students; (b) an intervention program that exposes students to both the required domain knowledge and its importance to their work; and (c) initial data that supports the success of this intervention program in bridging these gaps.","Biomedical Signal Processing; Data Science Education; Interdisciplinary Education; Project-based Learning; Biomedical Signal Processing; C (programming Language); Engineering Education; Cross-disciplinary Teams; Electrical Engineering Students; Interdisciplinary Education; Interdisciplinary Learning; Intervention Programs; Pedagogical Tools; Project Based Learning; Real-life Problems; Students","Biomedical signal processing; C (programming language); Engineering education; Cross-disciplinary teams; Electrical engineering students; Interdisciplinary education; Interdisciplinary learning; Intervention programs; Pedagogical tools; Project based learning; Real-life problems; Students","","Alvargonzález, David, Multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, and the sciences, International Studies in the Philosophy of Science, 25, 4, pp. 387-403, (2011); Fourth Industrial Revolution, (2016); Taajamaa, Ville Mikael, Interdisciplinary engineering education - Practice based case, pp. 31-37, (2014); Hadim, Hamid A., Enhancing the engineering curriculum through project-based learning, Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE, 2, (2002); Liu, Jyi-Shane, A project mediation approach to interdisciplinary learning, 2005, pp. 54-58, (2005); Food Culture Society, (2005); Choi, Bernard C.K., Multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity in health research, services, education and policy: 1.

Keeping in mind, the growing importance of data science, under-graduates need to be introduced to data science courses in their first year of under-graduation itself. Although first year undergraduates are furnished with the required mathematical and statistical concepts during their higher secondary education, a requirement of understanding sophisticated programming concepts hamstrings universities from offering courses in data science to first year undergraduates. As an outcome of our research, we propose a software named MetaData. MetaData abstracts all levels of implementation and helps students better understand the fundamental concepts in data science by observing the applicability of these concepts on real-world datasets. We justify the effectiveness of the tool through a data science classroom scenario, wherein 44 first year undergraduates were encouraged to use the tool and provide constructive feedback.","Data Science Education; Data Science Lifecycle; Pedagogy; User-friendly Tool; Metadata; Constructive Feedback; Fundamental Concepts; Programming Concepts; Real-world Datasets; Science Classroom; Science Course; Science Education; Statistical Concepts; Data Science","Metadata; Constructive feedback; Fundamental concepts; Programming concepts; Real-world datasets; Science classroom; Science course; Science education; Statistical concepts; Data Science","","Iit Bombay an Indian University Curriculum; De Veaux, Richard D., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 15-30, (2017); Curriculum the Central Board of Secondary Education India; Hardin, Johanna S., Data Science in Statistics Curricula: Preparing Students to “Think with Data”, American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 343-353, (2015); Song, Il Yeol, Big Data and Data Science: Opportunities and Challenges of iSchools, Journal of Data and Information Science, 2, 3, pp. 1-18, (2017); Procedia Social Behav Sci, (2015); Anderson, Paul E., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, pp. 145-150, (2014); Srikant, Shashank, Introducing data science to school kids, pp. 561-566, (2017); Heinemann, Birte, Drafting a data science curriculum for secondary schools, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, (2018); Integration of Data Science in the Primary and Secondary Curriculum","","Association for Computing Machinery","","9781450385855; 9781450314398; 9781450396387; 9781450390019; 9781450390217; 9781450348270; 9781450381963; 9781450322485; 9781450348201; 9781450364454","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085932752"

Assignments and projects are essential parts of the DS curriculum as they enable students to gain hands-on experience in real-world DS tasks. However, most current assignments and projects are lacking in at least one of two ways: 1) they do not comprehensively teach all the steps involved in the complete workflow of DS projects; 2) students work on separate problems individually or in small teams, limiting the scale and impact of their solutions. To overcome these limitations, we envision novel synergistic modular assignments where a large number of students work collectively on all the tasks equired to develop a large-scale DS product. The resulting product can be continuously improved with students' contributions every semester. We report our experience with developing and deploying such an assignment in an Information Retrieval course. Through the assignment, students collectively developed a search engine for finding expert faculty specializing in a given field. This shows the utility of such assignments both for teaching useful DS skills and driving innovation and research. We share useful lessons for other instructors to adopt similar assignments for their DS courses.","Experience Report; Practical Data Science Education; Synergistic Modular Assignments; Curricula; Data Science; Education Computing; Search Engines; Teaching; Experience Report; Growing Demand; Large Scale Data; Modularized; Real-world; Science Education; Synergistic Modular Assignments; Two Ways; Students","Curricula; Data Science; Education computing; Search engines; Teaching; Experience report; Growing demand; Large scale data; Modularized; Real-world; Science education; Synergistic modular assignments; Two ways; Students","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1801652","Amati, Gianni, Probabilistic Models of Information Retrieval Based on Measuring the Divergence from Randomness, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 20, 4, pp. 357-389, (2002); Anderson, Paul E., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, pp. 145-150, (2014); Anslow, Craig, Datathons: An experience report of data hackathons for data science education, pp. 615-620, (2016); Factors Determining the Performance of Indexing Systems, (1966); Daniel, Ben Kei, Big Data and analytics in higher education: Opportunities and challenges, British Journal of Educational Technology, 46, 5, pp. 904-920, (2015); Teaching Data Driven Innovation Facing A Challenge for Higher Education, (2017); Facfinder Search for Expertise in Academic Institutions, (2008); Geigle, Chase, CLaDS: A cloud-based virtual lab for the delivery of scalable hands-on assignments for practical data science education, Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE, pp. 176-181, (2018); Hardin, Johanna S., Data Science in Statistics Curricula: Preparing Students to “Think with Data”, American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 343-353, (2015); Love, Matthew, Nifty with data: Can a business intelligence analysis sourced from open data form a nifty assignment?, Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE, 11-13-July-2016, pp. 344-349, (2016)","","","","9781450367936","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081537039"

This work depicts the interdisciplinary landscape of iSchools from research outcomes publication knowledge  diffusion input reference output citation and school level based on the WoS publications of 36 iCaucus members in iSchools from 2009 to 2018. Interdisciplinarity is measured by three indicators namely variety balance and intensity. We found that 1 The interdisciplinary characteristics of research outcomes are high subject variety and high subject imbalance. Firstly the papers published by iSchools include 227 disciplines covering 89. 37% of the WoS subject classification the number of disciplines involved in the papers is generally increasing. Secondly the publications are relatively concentrated on a few disciplines such as library and information science and computer science. In addition the overall interdisciplinary intensity of research outcomes is 56. 81% which means 56. 81% of publications involved two or more disciplines reflecting their multidisciplinary nature. 2 The interdisciplinary characteristics of knowledge diffusion are high subject variety and relatively high subject imbalance. Firstly knowledge input and knowledge output cover around 254 WoS subject classifications which shows researches of iSchools are relatively open. Secondly according to the cumulative percentage of the disciplinary distribution the top ten disciplines in knowledge input and output have respectively reached 44% and 46% indicating the relative concentration of knowledge diffusion. In addition the interdisciplinary intensity of knowledge input is 54. 71% indicating that iSchools have cited many papers from other disciplines and their development is mainly related to the cross-border integration of multidisciplinary knowledge. The interdisciplinary intensity of knowledge output is 55. 11% which indicates that iSchools papers have been widely cited by papers from other disciplines and iSchools have formed a strong capacity to output and to infiltrate knowledge to other disciplines. 3 The interdisciplinary characteristics of iSchools members are quite different. The interdisciplinary diversity of UC Irvine Cornell University and Monash University are at the forefront while the interdisciplinary diversity of Humboldt University of Berlin San Jose State University and Renmin University of China lag behind. UC Irvine and Cornell University publish very low percentages of papers in library and information  science. According to the factor analysis of research outcomes knowledge input and knowledge output 36 colleges can be divided into six categories library information computer science data science education research communication and management. The number of colleges in the library and information category is the largest. 4 Library and information science is closely related to iField but significant differences also exist. Library and information science is the subject with the highest proportion of research outputs and the most important source of knowledge for the iField. But the proportion is not high with 22. 87% in research outcomes 13. 05% in reference and 8. 88% in cited paper. It also indicates a downward trend over time. The tendency of iSchools to eliminate library and information science is obvious. In addition though many colleges are currently classified in library and information science subject many of them have a clear trend of diversification. There are several limitations in this study. Taking the iCaucus member as an example to explore the interdisciplinary characteristics of iSchools researches the generalizability of its conclusions needs to be further verified. Second in addition to the diversity balance and intensity combining with more comprehensive indicators may make the conclusion more credible and complete. Finally the sample data from WoS are insufficient to implement a thorough bibliometric analysis. 4 figs. 7 tabs. 56 refs.","Citation Analysis; Interdisciplinary; Ischools; Knowledge Diffusion; Knowledge Outcome; Library And Information Science","","17ATQ009)的研究成果之一。 (This article is an outcome of the key project “Evaluating Synthetically the International Impact of Chinese Research Works in Humanities and Social Sciences”(No. 17ATQ009)supported by National Social Science Foundation of China. ) 通信作者:杨思洛,Email:58605025@qq.com,ORCID:0000-0003-3228-1102(Correspondence should be addressed to YANG Siluo,Email:58605025@ qq. com,ORCID:0000-0003-3228-1102)","Why interdisciplinary research matters, Nature, 525, 7569, (2015); Chakraborty, Tanmoy, Rising popularity of interdisciplinary research - An analysis of citation networks, (2014); Smajgl, Alex, A framework to bridge science and policy in complex decision making arenas, Futures, 52, pp. 52-58, (2013); Directory; Journal of Library Science in China, (2017); Zhang, Ping, The intellectual characteristics of the information field: Heritage and substance, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 64, 12, pp. 2468-2491, (2013); Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research, pp. 1-306, (2005); Rafols, Ismael, Diversity and network coherence as indicators of interdisciplinarity: Case studies in bionanoscience, Scientometrics, 82, 2, pp. 263-287, (2010); Stokols, Daniel, Evaluating transdisciplinary science, Nicotine and Tobacco Research, 5, SUPPL. 1, pp. S21-S39, (2003); Levitt, Jonathan Mendel, Variations between subjects in the extent to which the social sciences have become more interdisciplinary, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 62, 6, pp. 1118-1129, (2011)","","Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China","10018867","","","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127824541"

In this study we present initial results from an ongoing qualitative study of an interdisciplinary cyberinfrastructure-focused NSF-funded graduate data science education workshop hosted at an iSchool in the US. The complexity of the workshop curriculum, the participants’ and instructors’ disparate disciplinary backgrounds, and the technical tools employed are particularly suited to qualitative methods which can synthesize all of these aspects from rich observational, ethnographic, and trace data collected as part of the authors’ role on the grant’s qualitative evaluation team. The success of the workshop in equipping participants to do reproducible computational science was in part due to the successful acculturation process, whereby participants comprehended, altered, and enacted new norms amongst themselves. At the same time, we observed potential challenges for data science instruction resulting from the rhetorical framing of the technologies as inescapably new. This language, which mirrors that of a successful grant proposal, tends to obscure the deeply embedded and contingent history of the command-line technologies required to preform computational science, many of which are decades old. We conclude by describing our ongoing work, future theoretical sampling plans from this and future data, and the contributions that our findings can provide to graduate data science curriculum development and pedagogy.","Data Science Education; Grounded Theory; Temporality; Curricula; Computational Science; Cyber Infrastructures; Graduate Education; Qualitative Evaluations; Qualitative Method; Science Curriculum; Science Education; Science Instructions; Data Science","Curricula; Computational science; Cyber infrastructures; Graduate education; Qualitative evaluations; Qualitative method; Science curriculum; Science education; Science instructions; Data Science","This work was partially supported by National Science Foundation grant 1730390.","Adolph, Steve, Using grounded theory to study the experience of software development, Empirical Software Engineering, 16, 4, pp. 487-513, (2011); Apramian, Tavis, (Re)Grounding grounded theory: a close reading of theory in four schools, Qualitative Research, 17, 4, pp. 359-376, (2017); Bates, Marcia J., The invisible substrate of information science, Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 50, 12, pp. 1043-1050, (1999); Constructing Grounded Theory A Practical Guide Through Qualitative Analysis, (2006); Geiger, R.

This has led to over a decade of calls to establish a corresponding field of Data Science Education. There is still a need, however, to more deeply conceptualize what a field of Data Science Education might entail in terms of scope, responsibility, and execution. This special issue explores how one distinguishing feature of Data Science—its focus on data collected from social and environmental contexts within which learners often find themselves deeply embedded—suggests serious implications for learning and education. The learning sciences is uniquely positioned to investigate how such contextual embeddings impact learners’ engagement with data including conceptual, experiential, communal, racialized, spatial, and political dimensions. This special issue demonstrates the richly layered relationships learners build with data and reveals them to be not merely utilitarian mechanisms for learning about data, but a critical part of navigating data as social text and understanding Data Science as a discipline. Together, the contributions offer a vision of how the learning sciences can contribute to a more expansive, agentive and socially aware Data Science Education.","","","Funding text 1: Many ideas discussed in this introduction emerged from collective discussion at the 2016 Youth, Learning, and Data Science Summit.

This paper reports on a design study in which diverse middle and high school youth in a free summer workshop at an urban public library were asked to model their family geobiographies, or their personal family migration stories, with socioeconomic LSDS. Youth represented family decision-making and social conditions that might have motivated family movements with online, dynamic data modeling and mapping tools (Gapminder.org; SocialExplorer.com). The qualitative video analysis examined participants’ experiences and learning in storytelling and modeling the family geobiography, focusing on multimodal talk-in-interaction to understand how the study design engaged learners’ capacities, histories, and imagined futures in relation to the LSDS and supported learning about oneself and society.

One promising phenomenon investigated in related work is perspective-taking. A first-person “actor” perspective can help facilitate group and individual sensemaking by mediating observations and actions taken by learners. Here we investigate how museum visitors made use of an actor perspective when exploring an open-ended, interactive data map museum exhibit. We use a mix of qualitative and quantitative empirical methods to explore how actor perspective-taking (APT) may mediate joint sensemaking around data visualizations. By applying interpretive coding to 54 conversations wherein APT naturalistically emerged, we identify 3 distinct self-to-data relationships constructed via APT: role-play, projection, and orientation. A further analysis explores how APT was embedded in joint sensemaking of the visualized data. Twelve APT-mediated sensemaking processes are identified; two (extrapolating and noticing absence) were used in conjunction with multiple APT self-to-data relationships, while the remaining ten (e.g., enacting, spatially characterizing, generalizing) were exclusively used with specific self-to-data APT relationships. We use these empirical findings to generate hypotheses about how APT and associated sensemaking processes may support Data Science learning goals.","","","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [NSF INSPIRE 1248052] and the National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant HD 51357].","Abrahamson, Dor, Making sense of movement in embodied design for mathematics learning, Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications, 1, 1, (2016); Allen, Sue, Looking for Learning in Visitor Talk: A Methodological Exploration, pp. 259-303, (2003); Jigsaw Classroom, (1978); Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences, (2006); Berman, Francine, Realizing the potential of data science, Communications of the ACM, 61, 4, pp. 67-72, (2018); Börner, Katy, Investigating aspects of data visualization literacy using 20 information visualizations and 273 science museum visitors, Information Visualization, 15, 3, pp. 198-213, (2016); Brunyé, Tad T., When you and i share perspectives: Pronouns modulate perspective taking during narrative comprehension, Psychological Science, 20, 1, pp. 27-32, (2009); Edelson, Daniel C., Addressing the Challenges of Inquiry-Based Learning Through Technology and Curriculum Design, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 8, 3-4, pp. 391-450, (1999); Enyedy, Noel, Constructing and deconstructing materially-anchored conceptual blends in an augmented reality collaborative learning environment, Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Conference, CSCL, 1, pp. 192-199, (2013); undefined, (2000)","","Routledge aabs@uw.edu","10508406; 15327809","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072064921"

Current pedagogy has focused either on data science or on purely analytic technical aspects. There is therefore, an opportunity to rethink how institutions can develop innovative data-focussed education programmes, addressing both modern industry and community demands. As both academia and industry strive to integrate applied learning, transferable and enterprise skills into business and sciences, this paper proposes a design based research approach (DBR) for designing such a new interdisciplinary data science teaching curriculum as a foundation to deliver business undergraduate degrees in Business Data Science. Adopting a design science method our proposed DBR illustrates effective utilities for conceptualising and evaluating a fully functional new degree programme - Bachelor of Business Data Science. Ten senior business information systems academics and five analytics industry practitioners in Victoria, Australia were interviewed in three iterative prototyping phases followed by a final focus group session with business information systems students that evaluated the proposed structure. The findings suggest that proposed DBR ensures the design of an innovative data science degree that may meet growing industry and interdisciplinary demands.

It aims to introduce and justify the framework that allows flexibly evaluate the processes of a data expedition and a digital media created during it. For these purposes, the authors explore features of digital media artefacts which are specific to data expeditions and are essential to accurate evaluation. The rubrics as a power but hardly formalizable evaluation method in application to digital media artefacts are also discussed. Moreover, the paper documents the experience of rubrics creation according to the suggested framework. The rubrics were successfully adopted to two data-driven journalism courses. The authors also formulate recommendations on data expedition evaluation which should take into consideration structural features of a data expedition, distinctive features of digital media, etc.","Collaborative Technologies; Data Expedition; Data Science; Education; Data Science; Education; Collaborative Learning; Collaborative Technologies; Data Driven Journalisms; Data Expedition; Formative Assessment; Paper Documents; Science Education; Structural Feature; Digital Storage","Data Science; Education; Collaborative learning; Collaborative technologies; Data driven journalisms; Data expedition; Formative assessment; Paper documents; Science education; Structural feature; Digital storage","Funding text 1: Acknowledgment.

At first, only HSE-students of the first-year “Data Journalism” master program was involved into this activity. At second, the participation was obligatory because the DE acted as an assessment after several modules of the Scientific Research Seminar, “Open data” and “Introductory programming” courses. This explains by that the DE was targeted to evaluate complex skills in data-driven journalism which should have been shaped by the end of the first year of education. At third, DE was preceded by short in-class session where students divided into working teams and took part in discussion on evaluation rubrics. At fourth, collaboration between participants and administrators was supported by Microsoft Office 365 Education (using OneNote Class Notebook [24]).","undefined, (2013); undefined, (2017); Anderson, Paul E., Facilitating programming success in data science courses through gamified scaffolding and Learn2Mine, Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE, 2015-June, pp. 99-104, (2015); Koli Calling13 Koli, (2013); Beyond Data Literacy Reinventing Community Engagement and Empowerment in the Age of Data, (2015); Data Expeditions; Radchenko, Irina, On some russian educational projects in open data and data journalism, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9500, pp. 153-165, (2016); Data Science Education and Leadership Landscape, (2017); Teaching Data Science to Post Graduate Students A Preliminary Study Using A F L I P Class Room Approach International Conferences ITS, (2016); Giabbanelli, Philippe J., Teaching computational modeling in the data science era, Procedia Computer Science, 80, pp. 1968-1977, (2016)","Auer, M.E.; Tsiatsos, T.","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","21945357; 21945365","9783319604855; 9783319276427; 9783319419343; 9783319232034; 9783319938844; 9783642330414; 9783319262833; 9788132220084; 9783642375019; 9783030026820","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064639030"

As a result of the field's fluidity, there is often a mismatch between what datarelated programs teach, what employers expect, and the actual tasks data scientists are performing. In addition, the tools available to data scientists are not necessarily the tools being taught; textbooks do not seem to meet curricular needs; and empirical evidence does not seem to support existing program design. Currently, the field appears to be bifurcating into data science (DS) and data engineering (DE), with specific but overlapping roles in the combined data science and engineering (DSE) lifecycle. However, curriculum design has not yet caught up to this evolution.

Unlike these disciplines, however, data science education remains heavily focused on theory and methods, and practical coursework typically revolves around cleaned or simplified data sets that have little analog in professional applications. We believe that the environment in which new data scientists are trained should more accurately reflect that in which they will eventually practice, and we propose here a data science master's degree program that takes inspiration from the residency model used in medicine. Students in the suggested program would spend their time working on a practical problem with an industry, government, or nonprofit partner, supplemented with coursework in data science methods and theory. We also discuss how this program can also be implemented in shorter formats to augment existing professional master's programs in different disciplines. This approach to learning by doing is designed to fill gaps in our current approach to data science education and ensure that students develop the skills they need to practice data science in a professional context and under the many constraints imposed by that context.","Curriculum; Data Science; Data Science Competencies; Education; Training; Academic Achievement; Curriculum; Education; Medical Ethics; Organization And Management; Curriculum; Data Science; Education, Graduate; Ethics, Professional","academic achievement; curriculum; education; medical ethics; organization and management; Curriculum; Data Science; Education, Graduate; Ethics, Professional","For many of the skill domains described above, classroom-based coursework is an inefficient and ineffective method of building student competency.

Many scientific graduate degree programs expect students to acquire these computational skills in an applied statistics course. A gap remains, however, between the computational skills required for the implementation of statistics in scientific research and those taught in statistics courses. This qualitative study examines how five environmental science graduate students at one institution experience the phenomenon of acquiring the computational skills necessary to implement statistics in their research and the factors that foster or inhibit learning. In-depth interviews revealed three themes in these students' paths towards computational knowledge acquisition: use of peer support, seeking out a singular ""consultant, "" and learning through independent research experiences. These themes provide rich descriptions of graduate student experiences and strategies used while developing computational skills to apply statistics in their own research, thus informing how to improve instruction, both in and out of the formal classroom.","Data Science Education; Environmental Sciences; Statistics Education Research","","","Andelman, Sandy J., Understanding Environmental Complexity through a Distributed Knowledge Network, BioScience, 54, 3, pp. 240-246, (2004); Cobb, George W., Mere Renovation is Too Little Too Late: We Need to Rethink our Undergraduate Curriculum from the Ground Up, American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 266-282, (2015); Cortina, Thomas J., An introduction to computer science for non-majors using principles of computation, pp. 218-222, (2007); Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design Choosing Among Five Traditions, (1998); Fox, Joanne A., Education in Computational Biology Today and Tomorrow, PLOS Computational Biology, 9, 12, (2013); Friedman, Jerome H., The role of statistics in the data revolution?, International Statistical Review, 69, 1, pp. 5-10, (2001); Green, Jessica L., Complexity in ecology and conservation: Mathematical, statistical, and computational challenges, BioScience, 55, 6, pp. 501-510, (2005); Gutlerner, Johanna L., Catalyzing curriculum evolution in graduate science education, Cell, 153, 4, pp. 731-736, (2013); Hampton, Stephanie E., Skills and Knowledge for Data-Intensive Environmental Research, BioScience, 67, 6, pp. 546-557, (2017); Hardin, Johanna S., Data Science in Statistics Curricula: Preparing Students to “Think with Data”, American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 343-353, (2015)","","International Association for Statistical Education shse@cbs.nl","15701824","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082018919"

This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Analysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective? Findings: The highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this research are that this study only analyzed research papers in the Web of Science database and therefore only covers a certain amount of scientific papers published in the field of LIS. In addition, only publications with the term “data science” in the topic area of the Web of Science database were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that are not reflected in the Web of Science database or were related to other keywords such as “e-science,” “e-research,” “data service,” “data curation” or “research data management.” Originality/value: The field of data science has not been explored using bibliographic analysis of publications from the perspective of the LIS. This paper helps to better understand the field of data science and the perspectives for information professionals.","Bibliographic Analysis; Business Value; Data Management; Data Science; Data Scientist; Information Science; Iot; Library Science; Literature Review; Skills; Data Science; Database Systems; Internet Of Things; Knowledge Management; Publishing; Bibliographic Analysis; Business Value; Data Scientist; Design/methodology/approach; Iot; Library And Information Science; Library Science; Literature Reviews; Skill; Web Of Science; Libraries","Data Science; Database systems; Internet of things; Knowledge management; Publishing; Bibliographic analysis; Business value; Data scientist; Design/methodology/approach; IoT; Library and information science; Library science; Literature reviews; Skill; Web of Science; Libraries","","Agarwal, Ritu, Big data, data science, and analytics: The opportunity and challenge for IS research, Information Systems Research, 25, 3, pp. 443-448, (2014); Intelligent Techniques for Data Science, (2016); Big Data in Healthcare Springerbriefs in Pharmaceutical Science Drug Development, (2017); Antell, Karen, Dealing with data: Science librarians' participation in data management at association of research libraries institutions, College and Research Libraries, 75, 4, pp. 557-574, (2014); Aristodemou, Leonidas, The state-of-the-art on Intellectual Property Analytics (IPA): A literature review on artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning methods for analysing intellectual property (IP) data, World Patent Information, 55, pp. 37-51, (2018); Baškarada, Saša, Unicorn data scientist: the rarest of breeds, Program, 51, 1, pp. 65-74, (2017); Bell, Gordon C., Computer science: Beyond the data deluge, Science, 323, 5919, pp. 1297-1298, (2009); Are You Recruiting A Data Scientist or Unicorn, (2013); Big Data Little Data no Data Scholarship in the Networked World, (2015); Brunner, Robert J., Teaching data science, Procedia Computer Science, 80, pp. 1947-1956, (2016)","","Emerald Publishing","25149318; 25149288","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072114174"

However, data science education is not currently a graduation requirement at most colleges and universities. As a result, many graduates lack even basic knowledge of data science. To address the shortfall, academic institutions should incorporate introductory data science into general education courses. A general education IT course provides a unique opportunity to integrate data science education. Modules covering databases, spreadsheets, and presentation software, already present in many survey IT courses, teach concepts and skills needed for data science. As a result, a survey IT course can provide comprehensive introductory data science education by adding a data science module focused on modeling and evaluation, two key steps in the data science process. The module should use data science software for application, avoiding the complexities of programming and advanced math, while enabling an emphasis on conceptual understanding. We implemented a course built around these ideas and found that the course helps develop data savvy in students.","Crisp-dm; Data Mining; Data Visualization; Database; Information Technology Education; Introductory Data Science; Application Programs; Curricula; Data Mining; Data Science; Database Systems; Surveys; Academic Institutions; Colleges And Universities; Conceptual Understanding; Crisp-dm; General Education; Information Technology Education; National Academies; Science Education; Data Visualization","Application programs; Curricula; Data mining; Data Science; Database systems; Surveys; Academic institutions; Colleges and universities; Conceptual understanding; CRISP-DM; General education; Information technology education; National academies; Science education; Data visualization","","Anderson, Paul E., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, pp. 145-150, (2014); Baumer, Benjamin S., A Data Science Course for Undergraduates: Thinking With Data, American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 334-342, (2015); Not A Data Scientist You can Still Be Data Savvy, (2015); Journal of General Education, (2009); Brunner, Robert J., Teaching data science, Procedia Computer Science, 80, pp. 1947-1956, (2016); Crisp Dm 1 0 Step by Step Data Mining Guide, (2000); Danyluk, Andrea Pohoreckyj, ACM task force on data science education draft report and opportunity for feedback, pp. 496-497, (2019); De Veaux, Richard D., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 15-30, (2017); de Winter, Joost C.F., Five-point likert items: T test versus Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon, Practical Assessment, Research and Evaluation, 15, 11, (2010); Demchenko, Yuri S., EDISON data science framework: A foundation for building data science profession for research and industry, Proceedings of the International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science, CloudCom, 0, pp. 620-626, (2016)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc acmhelp@acm.org","","9781450369213","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073594142"

Data science is not an exception. In recent years scientists were concerned about a large number of irreproducible studies. Such reproducibility crisis in science could severely undermine public trust in science and science-based public policy. Recent efforts to promote reproducible research mainly focused on matured scientists and much less on student training. In this study, we conducted action research on students in data science to evaluate to what extent students are ready for communicating reproducible data analysis. The results show that although two-thirds of the students claimed they were able to reproduce results in peer reports, only one-third of reports provided all necessary information for replication. The actual replication results also include conflicting claims; some lacked comparisons of original and replication results, indicating that some students did not share a consistent understanding of what reproducibility means and how to report replication results. The findings suggest that more training is needed to help data science students communicating reproducible data analysis.","Action Research; Communication; Data Science Education; Reproducibility; Reproducible Data Analysis; Data Science; Students; Action Research; Data Science Education; Public Trust; Reproducibilities; Reproducible Data Analyse; Reproducible Research; Science Education; Scientific Researches; Student Training; Data Handling","Data Science; Students; Action research; Data science education; Public trust; Reproducibilities; Reproducible data analyse; Reproducible research; Science education; Scientific researches; Student training; Data handling","","Providing New Incentives to Foster Open Science and Increase Reproducibility, (2014); King, Gary, Publication, publication, PS - Political Science and Politics, 39, 1, pp. 119-125, (2006); Nature, (2016); Rigorous Replication Effort Succeeds for Just Two of Five Cancer Papers, (2017); American Economic Review, (1986); Peng, Roger D., Reproducible epidemiologic research, American Journal of Epidemiology, 163, 9, pp. 783-789, (2006); Aarts, Alexander A., Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science, Science, 349, 6251, (2015); Peng, Roger D., Reproducible research in computational science, Science, 334, 6060, pp. 1226-1227, (2011); King, Gary, Replication, Replication, PS - Political Science and Politics, 28, 3, pp. 444-452, (1995); Donoho, David L., An invitation to reproducible computational research, Biostatistics, 11, 3, pp. 385-388, (2010)","","MIT Press Journals","2641435X; 20967004","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087408658"

It is forecast that 75% of enterprise applications will use AI, Machine Learning or Deep Learning technology by 2021, yet university programs commonly place the burden on students to obtain their data science educations through elective coursework spanning multiple disparate departments. Data science requires specific mathematics preparation especially for cybersecurity students whose programs have reduced the requirements for advance mathematics to a bare minimum. To facilitate curricula preparation, and hands-on usage of AI tools, a notebook ('A Trellis For Novice AI Practitioners') was prepared in the R programming language as a first step in introducing computer science and cybersecurity students to the concepts and capabilities of AI. A focus on an intrusion detection data set to mitigate nine common cyber vulnerabilities is used in this analysis. Trellis bridges the theoretical and practical chasm for students by building an ANN network intrusion predictive model from scratch. It serves as a template but also encourages heavy contextual modification, and may be relied upon in the beginning stages of a cybersecurity practitioner's data science activities on a wide variety of data sets in all areas of the discipline.","Ai; Deep-belie/network; Dl; Ml; R; Application Programs; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Programming; Curricula; Data Science; Deep Learning; Education Computing; Intrusion Detection; Cyber Vulnerabilities; Deep-belie/network; Enterprise Applications; Learning Technology; Network Intrusions; Predictive Modeling; Science Activities; University Programs; Students","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Computer programming; Curricula; Data Science; Deep learning; Education computing; Intrusion detection; Cyber vulnerabilities; Deep-Belie/Network; Enterprise applications; Learning technology; Network intrusions; Predictive modeling; Science activities; University programs; Students","","San Diego Business Journal, (2019); R Deep Learning Essentials, (2018); Idc, (2019); Hands on Cybersecurity Artificial Intelligence Plenary Session Presentation 23rd Colloquium for Information Systems Security Education, (2019); Intrusion Detection Data Set of 2 540 044 Records for Nine Types of Attacks, (2019); Open Source R Notebook, (2019); undefined, (2019); Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and Tensorflow Concepts Tools and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems, (2017); Hinton, Geoffrey E., A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets, Neural Computation, 18, 7, pp. 1527-1554, (2006); Precision and Recall, (2024)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9781728124643","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078003033"

Many people who currently teach data science are practitioners such as computational researchers in academia or data scientists in industry. To understand how these practitioner-instructors pass their knowledge onto novices and how that contrasts with teaching more traditional forms of programming, we interviewed 20 data scientists who teach in settings ranging from small-group workshops to large online courses. We found that: 1) they must empathize with a diverse array of student backgrounds and expectations, 2) they teach technical workflows that integrate authentic practices surrounding code, data, and communication, 3) they face challenges involving authenticity versus abstraction in software setup, finding and curating pedagogically-relevant datasets, and acclimating students to live with uncertainty in data analysis. These findings can point the way toward better tools for data science education and help bring data literacy to more people around the world.","Data Science Education; Teaching Programming; Human Computer Interaction; Human Engineering; Students; Uncertainty Analysis; Group Workshops; Online Course; Science Education; Teaching Programming; Work-flows; Data Science","Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Students; Uncertainty analysis; Group workshops; Online course; Science education; Teaching programming; Work-flows; Data Science","Thanks to the UC San Diego Design Lab, rOpenSci, Elissa Redmiles, and Os Keyes for their feedback, and NSF award #1735234 for funding.","50 Most Popular Moocs of all Time, (2017); Complete List of Data Science Bootcamps Fellowships, (2017); Project Jupyter, (2019); Data Carpentry Building Communities Teaching Universal Data Literacy, (2018); Datacamp Learn R Python Data Science Online, (2018); Dataquest Learn Data Science with Python and R Projects, (2018); Ggplot2 is A System for Declaratively Creating Graphics Based on the Grammar of Graphics, (2018); Jupyterhub A Multi User Version of the Notebook Designed for Companies Classrooms and Research Labs, (2018); R Markdown Analyze Share Reproduce, (2018); Rstudio for the Enterprise, (2018)","","Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org","","1581132484; 0897913833; 9781595936424; 1581136374; 9781450346559; 9781595930026; 9781605589312; 9781450356206; 9781450310161; 9781581137033","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067608716"

Although some standalone programs in Data Science have been established around the country, many institutions encounter the challenges in balancing the curricula among different disciplines, allocating new resources, and cooperating with the existing majors regarding enrollment management, student advising, and faculty preparation. In this paper, a strategy-based framework is proposed for those who have limited resources of all kinds to introduce Data Science through their existing Computer Science programs at a baccalaureate level with a minimum curriculum disruption. Instead of a standalone program, to embed Data Science into Computer Science education is demonstrated to be a practical, effective, cost-saving approach based on an extensive study of the synergy between Data Science and Computer Science education. While the proposed framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach, it provides a doable route for blending Data Science into Computer Science education in systematic ways. It has become the consensus that an adequate exposure to Data Science will better prepare computer science students for taking the challenges in this ever-changing, data embraced world.","Computer Science Education; Curriculum Design; Data Science Education; Blending; Curricula; Data Science; Education Computing; Engineering Education; Students; Computer Science Education; Computer Science Programs; Computer Science Students; Cost Saving; Curriculum Designs; Enrollment Management; Library Science; Science Education; Information Management","Blending; Curricula; Data Science; Education computing; Engineering education; Students; Computer Science Education; Computer science programs; Computer science students; Cost saving; Curriculum designs; Enrollment management; Library science; Science education; Information management","","Berman, Francine, Realizing the potential of data science, Communications of the ACM, 61, 4, pp. 67-72, (2018); Burtch Works Study Salaries of Data Scientists, (2014); Cao, Longbing, Data science: A comprehensive overview, ACM Computing Surveys, 50, 3, (2018); Berkeley S Undergraduate Data Science Curriculum Year 1 Pedagogical Overview, (2018); De Veaux, Richard D., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 15-30, (2017); Edison Data Science Framework Part 1 Data Science Competence Framework Cf Ds Release 2, (2017); Dumbill, Edd, Educating the Next Generation of Data Scientists, Big Data, 1, 1, pp. 21-27, (2013); Analyzing the Analyzers an Introspective Survey of Data Scientists and their Work, (2013); Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, (2019); Louridas, Panos, Embedded analytics and statistics for big data, IEEE Software, 30, 6, pp. 33-39, (2013)","","IEEE Computer Society help@computer.org","21540373; 21540357","9781479947744; 9781665480093; 9781509047673; 9781467399852; 9798350330649; 9781665418461; 9781467308199; 9781665493765; 9781728109275; 9781467352086","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072845554"

Hence, it is necessary to design efficient education techniques to rapidly train the next generation of students. We describe a holistic approach that integrates multiple objectives within a single semester course taught at the first year level. The objectives include basic data processing techniques, statistical analysis, teamwork, and project management. We conducted a project that combined different public datasets related to the cost and quality of education in the US. Students demonstrated a high degree of involvement in this exercise as they were curious to explore data that related to their own college selection process. It is well known that it is difficult to perform a cost-quality analysis in the field of college education.We used college ranking data created by the Wall Street Journal, and combined it with data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System database (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) that provided college costs and graduation data. Students worked in teams to download sections of the data from multiple sources, performed cleaning and verification, and merged the data for analysis. This taught them the values of teamwork, goal-setting, and process measurement for timely project completion.We determined that the Pearson correlation between the rank of a college and in-state tuition was-0.65 (p<0.005) for private colleges, and-0.34 (p<0.005) for public colleges. This indicates that higher ranked colleges tend to charge higher tuition. The Pearson correlation between the rank of all colleges and their graduation rates is-0.75 (p<0.005), and between rank and retention rates is-0.71 (p<0.005). Private college tuition is typically $40,000 annually, whereas public colleges cost $20,000. These figures suggest that public colleges provide good value. This has policy implications for government funding of education.","Curricular Development; Data Science; Project Management; Statistical Analysis; Correlation Methods; Cost Benefit Analysis; Data Handling; Data Science; Human Resource Management; Project Management; Public Policy; Quality Control; Statistical Methods; Curricular Development; Data Processing Techniques; Data System Database; Education Technique; Postsecondary Education; Process Measurements; Quality Of Education; Wall Street Journal; Students","Correlation methods; Cost benefit analysis; Data handling; Data Science; Human resource management; Project management; Public policy; Quality control; Statistical methods; Curricular development; Data processing techniques; Data system database; Education technique; Postsecondary education; Process measurements; Quality of education; Wall Street Journal; Students","","Salzman, Hal, What shortages? the real evidence about the STEM workforce, Issues in Science and Technology, 29, 4, pp. 58-67, (2013); Charette, Robert N., The STEM crisis is a myth, IEEE Spectrum, 50, 9, pp. 44-59, (2013); New York Times, (2017); Stem Occupations Past Present and Future, (2017); Desperate for Data Scientists, (2018); Wall Street Journal, (2018); Turk-Bicakci, Lori, University-industry collaboration: Patterns of growth for low- and middle-level performers, Higher Education, 49, 1-2, pp. 61-89, (2005); Hutchison, Laveria F., Addressing the STEM Teacher Shortage in American Schools: Ways to Recruit and Retain Effective STEM Teachers, Action in Teacher Education, 34, 5-6, pp. 541-550, (2012); Howe, Bill, Data science education: We're missing the boat, again, Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering, pp. 1473-1474, (2017); Technology Innovations in Statistics Education, (2013)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9781728115023","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074979383"

The power of evidence-based, inductive reasoning distinguishes data science from science. Hence, this chapter argues that, in its initial stages, data science applications and the data science discipline itself be developed inductively and deductively in a virtuous cycle. The virtues of the twentieth Century Virtuous Cycle (aka virtuous hardwaresoftware cycle, Intel-Microsoft virtuous cycle) that built the personal computer industry (National Research Council, The new global ecosystem in advanced computing: Implications for U.S. competitiveness and national security. The National Academies Press, Washington, DC, 2012) were being grounded in reality and being self-perpetuating-more powerful hardware enabled more powerful software that required more powerful hardware, enabling yet more powerful software, and so forth. Being grounded in reality-solving genuine problems at scale-was critical to its success, as it will be for data science. While it lasted, it was self-perpetuating, due to a constant flow of innovation, and to benefitting all participants-producers, consumers, the industry, the economy, and society. It is a wonderful success story for twentieth Century applied science. Given the success of virtuous cycles in developing modern technology, virtuous cycles grounded in reality should be used to develop data science, driven by the wisdom of the sixteenth Century proverb, Necessity is the mother of invention. This chapter explores this hypothesis using the example of the evolution of database management systems over the last 40 years. For the application of data science to be successful and virtuous, it should be grounded in a cycle that encompasses industry (i.e., real problems), research, development, and delivery. This chapter proposes applying the principles and lessons of the virtuous cycle to the development of data science applications; to the development of the data science discipline itself, for example, a data science method; and to the development of data science education; all focusing on the critical role of collaboration in data science research and management, thereby addressing the development challenges faced by the more than 150 Data Science Research Institutes (DSRIs) worldwide. A companion chapter (Brodie, What is Data Science, in Braschler et al (Eds.), Applied data science - Lessons learned for the data-driven business, Springer 2019), addresses essential questions that DSRIs should answer in preparation for the developments proposed here: What is data science?

To realize the potential of big data in biomedicine, the National Institutes of Health launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative, funding several centers of excellence in biomedical data analysis and a Training Coordinating Center (TCC) tasked with facilitating online and in-person training of biomedical researchers in data science. A major initiative of the BD2K TCC is to automatically identify, describe, and organize data science training resources available on the Web and provide personalized training paths for users. In this paper, we describe the construction of ERuDIte, the Educational Resource Discovery Index for Data Science, and its release as linked data. ERuDIte contains over 11,000 training resources including courses, video tutorials, conference talks, and other materials. The metadata for these resources is described uniformly using Schema.org. We use machine learning techniques to tag each resource with concepts from the Data Science Education Ontology, which we developed to further describe resource content. Finally, we map references to people and organizations in learning resources to entities in DBpedia, DBLP, and ORCID, embedding our collection in the web of linked data. We hope that ERuDIte will provide a framework to foster open linked educational resources on the Web.","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Data Handling; Learning Systems; Neuroimaging; Biology And Medicine; Biomedical Data Analysis; Centers Of Excellence; Educational Resource; Fundings; Linked Datum; Massive Data Sets; National Institute Of Healths; Subfields; Training Paths; Linked Data","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data handling; Learning systems; Neuroimaging; Biology and medicine; Biomedical data analysis; Centers of excellence; Educational resource; Fundings; Linked datum; Massive data sets; National institute of healths; Subfields; Training paths; Linked data","This work is supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under Grant 1U24ES026465.

Through interaction analysis of video data, we identified ten data wrangling practices and developed a conceptual model of the data wrangling process that contains four interrelated recursive stages. These data wrangling practices and the process of data wrangling are important to understand for supporting future data science education opportunities that facilitate learning and discussion about scientific and socioeconomic issues.

Thus, researchers have suggested the urgency for universities to review their curricular as the world is heading towards data era. The aim of this research was to analyze the current skill-gaps needs from stakeholders and opportunities to establish data science postgraduate programme that reflects the current technological trends and market demands at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM). A questionnaire was administered to 85 identified organizations to solicit information on the needs for data scientists and existing skill gaps. A total of 61 filled questionnaires response were received out of the 85 that were administered to selected organizations indicating a turn out rate of over 70%. Overall the analyzed data articulated a compelling evidence for the local industry growing need for data scientist. The survey that was conducted was followed up by conduct of various workshops and meetings to solicit inputs from different experts and stakeholders on different versions of the developed curriculum. Finally, a new programme in MSc in data Science was approved and established from April 2018 at UDSM. Despite its late approval and without formal advertisement on the public media, the programme attracted a large number of applicants for 2018/19 academic year, compared to other several postgraduate programmes in ICT offered at UDSM.","Data Science; Data Science Education; Data Scientists; Ict; Skills-gap; Udsm; Commerce; Developing Countries; Social Aspects; Surveys; Current Demands; Data Scientists; International Federation For Information Processing; Postgraduate Education; Science Education; Skills Gaps; Technological Trends; Udsm; Data Science","Commerce; Developing countries; Social aspects; Surveys; Current demands; Data scientists; International Federation for Information Processing; Postgraduate education; Science education; Skills gaps; Technological trends; UDSM; Data Science","South African educational institutions stands by far as African leading institutions in provision of different forms of data science education including the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) South Africa [11] which offers two months intensive data science training and the University of Witwatersrand [12], offering a one year degree program in Big data Analytics. Tanzania has not been left behind, in this dynamics as there has been a few initiatives that aim to strengthen data use and data driven innovation although largely funded through international donor programs. As part of open government partnership (OGP) membership the country implemented a basic statistics public data portal, and received data capacity building support through the World Bank and other international donor agencies [13]. The basic statistics portal [14] was established to provide data in a machine readable format to be used and reused by anybody.

The adoption of DL in hydrology has so far been gradual, but the field is now ripe for breakthroughs. This paper suggests that DL-based methods can open up a complementary avenue toward knowledge discovery in hydrologic sciences. In the new avenue, machine-learning algorithms present competing hypotheses that are consistent with data. Interrogative methods are then invoked to interpret DL models for scientists to further evaluate. However, hydrology presents many challenges for DL methods, such as data limitations, heterogeneity and co-evolution, and the general inexperience of the hydrologic field with DL. The roadmap toward DL-powered scientific advances will require the coordinated effort from a large community involving scientists and citizens. Integrating process-based models with DL models will help alleviate data limitations. The sharing of data and baseline models will improve the efficiency of the community as a whole. Open competitions could serve as the organizing events to greatly propel growth and nurture data science education in hydrology, which demands a grassroots collaboration. The area of hydrologic DL presents numerous research opportunities that could, in turn, stimulate advances in machine learning as well.","Artificial Intelligence; Hydrology; Learning Algorithms; Data Limitations; Hydrologic Science; Industry Applications; Integrating Process; Research Opportunities; Science Education; Scientific Advances; Scientific Discovery; Deep Learning; Algorithm; Applied Science; Education; Heterogeneity; Hydrology; Knowledge; Machine Learning; Technology Adoption","Artificial intelligence; Hydrology; Learning algorithms; Data limitations; Hydrologic science; Industry applications; Integrating process; Research opportunities; Science education; Scientific advances; Scientific discovery; Deep learning; algorithm; applied science; education; heterogeneity; hydrology; knowledge; machine learning; technology adoption","Acknowledgements.

This has led to a number of opinion pieces advocating for an update to the Statistics curriculum. The unifying recommendation is that computing should play a more prominent role. We strongly agree with this recommendation, but advocate the main priority is to bring applications to the forefront as proposed by Nolan and Speed in 1999. We also argue that the individuals tasked with developing data science courses should not only have statistical training, but also have experience analyzing data with the main objective of solving real-world problems. Here, we share a set of general principles and offer a detailed guide derived from our successful experience developing and teaching a graduate-level, introductory data science course centered entirely on case studies. We argue for the importance of statistical thinking, as defined by Wild and Pfannkuch in 1999 and describe how our approach teaches students three key skills needed to succeed in data science, which we refer to as creating, connecting, and computing. This guide can also be used for statisticians wanting to gain more practical knowledge about data science before embarking on teaching an introductory course.

Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers. Based on our results, we conclude that hack weeks present an effective, easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to positively impact data analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster collaboration, and cultivate best practices.","Data Science; Education; Interdisciplinary Collaboration; Reproducibility; Adult; Article; Career; Data Analysis; Education; Female; Human; Human Experiment; Immersion; Literacy; Male; Reproducibility; Self Report; Educational Model; Information Dissemination; Interdisciplinary Education; Science; University; Humans; Information Dissemination; Interdisciplinary Studies; Models, Educational; Science; Universities","adult; article; career; data analysis; education; female; human; human experiment; immersion; literacy; male; reproducibility; self report; educational model; information dissemination; interdisciplinary education; science; university; Humans; Information Dissemination; Interdisciplinary Studies; Models, Educational; Science; Universities","Funding text 1: Christine Huebner for advice on statistics; Brittany Fiore-Gartland, Laura Norén, and Jason Yeatman for comments on the manuscript; and Tal Yarkoni for advice regarding automated selection procedures.

The growing field of data science has the potential to address many of these needs, primarily due to recent efforts to collect large amounts of data related to social, environmental, and political issues. A challenge is that there exists a disconnect between these real-world issues and the course materials taught to university students. This gap is due in part to a lack of engagement between universities and their local communities, leaving students with few opportunities to work with datasets relevant to real-world problems. To address this disconnect, the authors have implemented a novel data science education and outreach program in which students acquire new knowledge and skills while creating positive social impact through community service. In this work, we outline this outreach program, the Michigan Data Science Team, and provide empirical evidence of positive educational and social impact.","Collaborative Learning; Data Science Education; Service-learning; Social Impact; Economic And Social Effects; Collaborative Learning; Community Services; Large Amounts Of Data; Real-world Problem; Science Education; Service Learning; Social Impact; University Students; Students","Economic and social effects; Collaborative learning; Community services; Large amounts of data; Real-world problem; Science education; Service learning; Social impact; University students; Students","The authors would like to acknowledge the rest of the MDST leadership team and members.

It is essential they learn by working on assignments that involve real world data sets to develop the skills needed to be successful in the workplace. However, enabling instructors to flexibly deliver all kinds of data science assignments using real world data sets to large numbers of learners (both on-campus and off-campus) at low cost is a significant open challenge. To address this emerging challenge generally, we develop and deploy a novel Cloud-based Lab for Data Science (CLaDS) to enable many learners around the world to work on real-world data science problems without having to move or otherwise distribute prohibitively large data sets. Leveraging version control and continuous integration, CLaDS provides a general infrastructure to enable any instructor to conveniently deliver any hands-on data science assignment that uses large real world data sets to as many learners as our cloud-computing infrastructure allows at very low cost. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CLaDS and discuss our experience with using CLaDS to deploy seven major text data assignments for students in both an on-campus course and an online course to work on for learning about text data retrieval and mining techniques; this shows that CLaDS is a very promising novel general infrastructure for efficiently delivering a wide range of hands-on data science assignments to a large number of learners at very low cost.","Cloud Computing; Data Science Education; Virtual Lab; Cloud Computing; Costs; Curricula; E-learning; Education Computing; Engineering Education; Engineering Research; Virtual Reality; Cloud Computing Infrastructures; Continuous Integrations; Design And Implementations; Mining Techniques; Science Education; Scientists And Engineers; Version Control; Virtual Lab; Big Data","Cloud computing; Costs; Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Engineering education; Engineering research; Virtual reality; Cloud computing infrastructures; Continuous integrations; Design and implementations; Mining techniques; Science education; Scientists and engineers; Version control; Virtual lab; Big data","This material is based upon work supported by the NSF GRFP under Grant Number DGE-1144245, by the NSF Research Program under Grant Number IIS-1629161, by Microsoft Azure, and by a gift fund from Intel under its support program for Big Data Education.","Extreme Programming Explained Embrace Change, (2000); Eisenstein, Jacob, A latent variable model for geographic lexical variation, pp. 1277-1287, (2010); Fang, Hui, VIRLab: A web-based virtual lab for learning and studying information retrieval models, pp. 1249-1250, (2014); Fang, Hui, VIR Lab: A platform for privacy-preserving evaluation for information retrieval models, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 1225, pp. 37-38, (2014); Fitzgerald, Brian, Continuous software engineering: A roadmap and agenda, Journal of Systems and Software, 123, pp. 176-189, (2017); González-Martínez, José Antonio, Cloud computing and education: A state-of-the-art survey, Computers and Education, 80, pp. 132-151, (2015); Joy, Mike S., The BOSS online submission and assessment system, ACM Journal on Educational Resources in Computing, 5, 3, (2005); Tacl, (2013); Massung, Sean, META: A unified toolkit for text retrieval and analysis, pp. 91-96, (2016); Matthies, Christoph, Prof. CI: Employing continuous integration services and github workflows to teach test-driven development, Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE, 2017-October, pp. 1-8, (2017)","Andreou, P.; Armoni, M.; Read, J.C.; Polycarpou, I.","Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org","1942647X","9781450368957; 9798400700101; 9781450363013; 9781450382939; 9781450318723; 9781450357074; 9781450362238; 9798400712081; 9798400706035; 9781450312462","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052018269"

Scientists, engineers, and executives routinely encounter enormous volumes of data, and new techniques and tools are emerging to create knowledge out of these data, some of them capable of working with real-time streams of data. The nation's ability to make use of these data depends on the availability of an educated workforce with necessary expertise. With these new capabilities have come novel ethical challenges regarding the effectiveness and appropriateness of broad applications of data analyses. The field of data science has emerged to address the proliferation of data and the need to manage and understand it. Data science is a hybrid of multiple disciplines and skill sets, draws on diverse fields (including computer science, statistics, and mathematics), encompasses topics in ethics and privacy, and depends on specifics of the domains to which it is applied. Fueled by the explosion of data, jobs that involve data science have proliferated and an array of data science programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels have been established. Nevertheless, data science is still in its infancy, which suggests the importance of envisioning what the field might look like in the future and what key steps can be taken now to move data science education in that direction. This study will set forth a vision for the emerging discipline of data science at the undergraduate level. This interim report lays out some of the information and comments that the committee has gathered and heard during the first half of its study, offers perspectives on the current state of data science education, and poses some questions that may shape the way data science education evolves in the future. The study will conclude in early 2018 with a final report that lays out a vision for future data science education.","Computer Privacy; Philosophical Aspects; Broad Application; Educated Workforce; Multiple Disciplines; Real-time Streams; Science Disciplines; Science Education; Science Programs; Techniques And Tools; Data Science","Computer privacy; Philosophical aspects; Broad application; Educated workforce; Multiple disciplines; Real-time streams; Science disciplines; Science education; Science programs; Techniques and tools; Data Science","","Presentation at the National Academies Data Science Education Workshop, (2016); undefined, (2014); undefined, (2017); Fairness in Criminal Justice Risk Assessments the State of the Art, (2017); Investing in America S Data Science and Analytics Talent the Case for Action, (2017); Making Sense of Privacy and Publicity, (2010); Butler, Declan M., When Google got flu wrong, Nature, 494, 7436, pp. 155-156, (2013); undefined, (2016); United States Conference on Teaching Statistics, (2017); Chen, Hsinchun Chun, Business intelligence and analytics: From big data to big impact, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 36, 4, pp. 1165-1188, (2012)","","National Academies Press","","9780309465021","","","English","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065628975"

In this paper, we describe the use of qualitative and quantitative methods to study data science projects completed by undergraduate students who are learning data science but have already learned computer programming. The projects are stored as Jupyter notebooks: documents that store code, as well as its output from execution, formatted text for self-explanations, and graphics. Our analysis of the notebooks discovers two kinds of student attitudes: explorers, who work iteratively, and goal accomplishers, who work incrementally. Despite varying attitudes, we find that students often fluctuate between the two learner types depending on their computational goals for a given notebook. Moreover, when students practice the explorer approach, they often engage more actively with many CT skills such as pattern generalization and communication of results. Finally, we propose ways to utilize these findings to encourage CT practices in future data science curricula.","Computational Thinking; Data Science Education; Jupyter Notebooks; Learner Types","","","Barr, Valerie B., Bringing computational thinking to K-12: What is involved and what is the role of the computer science education community?, ACM Inroads, 2, 1, pp. 48-54, (2011); Bau, David Anthony, Learnable programming: Blocks and beyond, Communications of the ACM, 60, 6, pp. 72-80, (2017); Assessment Design Patterns for Computational Thinking Practices in Secondary Computer Science A First Look, (2015); Boechler, Patricia M., Computational thinking, code complexity, and prior experience in a videogame-building assignment, pp. 396-398, (2014); Proceedings of the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association, (2012); Grover, Shuchi, A framework for using hypothesis-driven approaches to support data-driven learning analytics in measuring computational thinking in block-based programming environments, ACM Transactions on Computing Education, 17, 3, (2017); Kluyver, Thomas A., Jupyter Notebooks—a publishing format for reproducible computational workflows, pp. 87-90, (2016); IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, (2017); Journal of Interactive Media in Education, (2004); Pears, Arnold Neville, A survey of literature on the teaching of introductory programming, pp. 204-223, (2007)","KONG, S.-C.; SIN, K.-F.; ANDONE, D.; BISWAS, G.; CRICK, T.; HOPPE, H.U.; HSU, T.-C.; HUANG, R.; LI, R.K.-Y.; LOOI, C.-K.; MILRAD, M.; SHELDON, J.; TISSENBAUM, M.; SHIH, J.-L.; VAHRENHOLD, J.","The Education University of Hong Kong","26645661","9789463665636; 9789887703457; 9789887703464; 9789887703440","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103846829"

This is due to several good reasons. Probably an important one of those reasons is the growing demand to find proper ways to face the challenges of establishing data-driven economies and societies. As academics and educationalists, but also Data Science professionals, we look at how to bring up this kind of specialists such that to meet the current shortages but also mid-term demands. In this position paper we deliberate about how to architect thematically, didactically, and organizationally a university program under the thematic umbrella of Data Science. We focus on the selection of learning units or disciplines to be covered in order to produce the M.Sci. and Ph.D. graduates who will be ready to face the future challenges in the mid-term perspective. We outline our recommendation on using learning tools and materials. We also concisely present the approach for stimulating competitive and cooperative atmosphere in the class that stimulates intensive collective and individual learning. We recommend to reinforce an academic program by involving industrial partners intensively in the process.

However, as the amount of available data continues to increase, so does the demand for professionals who have the necessary skills to manage and manipulate this data. This paper presents the European Data Science Academy (EDSA), an initiative for bridging the data science skills gap across Europe and training a new generation of world-leading data scientists. The EDSA project has established a rigorous process and a set of best practices for the production and delivery of curricula for data science. Additionally, the project’s efforts are dedicated to linking the demand for data science skills with the supply of learning resources that offer these skills. In order to achieve this, EDSA is offering interactive tools for finding learning resources and building personalised learning pathways towards acquiring the skills that are currently in demand.","Courseware; Curricula; Data Science; Demand Analysis; Personalised Learning Pathways; Skills; Curricula; E-learning; Teaching; Courseware; Data Science; Demand Analysis; Personalised Learning; Skills; Personnel Training","Curricula; E-learning; Teaching; Courseware; Data science; Demand analysis; Personalised learning; Skills; Personnel training","Funding text 1: EDSA is a research project funded by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union, Grant Agreement no. 643937.; Funding text 2: Acknowledgement.

Modern data driven research and industry require new types of specialists that are capable to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. The education and training of Data Scientists currently lacks a commonly accepted, harmonized instructional model that reflects all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science practitioners in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. The educational model and approach should also solve different aspects of the future professionals that includes both theoretical knowledge and practical skills that must be supported by corresponding education infrastructure and educational labs environment. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple form, also providing sufficient data labs facilities for practical training. This paper discussed both aspects: building customizable Data Science curriculum for different types of learners and proposing a hybrid model for virtual labs that can combine local university facility and use cloud based Big Data and Data analytics facilities and services on demand.

These new trends impact the society and future jobs, and thus student careers. At the heart of this digital transformation is data science, the discipline that makes sense of big data. With many rapidly emerging digital challenges ahead of us, this article discusses perspectives on iSchools' opportunities and suggestions in data science education. We argue that iSchools should empower their students with ""information computing""disciplines, which we define as the ability to solve problems and create values, information, and knowledge using tools in application domains. As specific approaches to enforcing information computing disciplines in data science education, we suggest the three foci of user-based, tool-based, and application-based. These three foci will serve to differentiate the data science education of iSchools from that of computer science or business schools. We present a layered Data Science Education Framework (DSEF) with building blocks that include the three pillars of data science (people, technology, and data), computational thinking, data-driven paradigms, and data science lifecycles. Data science courses built on the top of this framework should thus be executed with user-based, tool-based, and application-based approaches. This framework will help our students think about data science problems from the big picture perspective and foster appropriate problem-solving skills in conjunction with broad perspectives of data science lifecycles. We hope the DSEF discussed in this article will help fellow iSchools in their design of new data science curricula.","Big Data; Computational Thinking; Data Science; Data Science Lifecycle; Data-driven Paradigm; Information Computing; Ischool; The Fourth Industrial Revolution","","","Ubs White Paper for the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2016, (2016); Journal of Scientific and Practical Computing, (2007); Davenport, Thomas H., Data scientist: The sexiest job of the 21st century, Harvard Business Review, 90, 10, (2012); Dhar, Vasant, Data science and prediction, Communications of the ACM, 56, 12, pp. 64-73, (2013); Organizing for Big Data Through Better Process and Governance, (2016); Recommendations for Implementing the Strategic Initiative Industrie 4 0, (2013); Lasi, Heiner, Industry 4.0, Business and Information Systems Engineering, 6, 4, pp. 239-242, (2014); Big Data A Revolution that Will Transform how We Live Work and Think, (2013); Provost, Foster John, Data Science and its Relationship to Big Data and Data-Driven Decision Making, Big Data, 1, 1, pp. 51-59, (2013); Fourth Industrial Revolution, (2016)","","Sciendo","2096157X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052224484"

However, currently, data science educators lack good tools and methodologies. In particular, they lack integrated tools through which their students can acquire hands-on software engineering experience. To address these problems, we designed and implemented DataLab, a web-based tool for data science education that integrates code, data and execution management into one system. The goal of DataLab is to provide a hands-on online lab environment to train students to have basic software engineering thinking and habits while maintaining a focus on the core data science contents. In this paper, we present the user-experience design and system-level implementation of DataLab. Further, we evaluate DataLab's performance through an in-classroom use case. Finally, using objective log-based learning behavior analysis and a subjective survey, we demonstrate DataLab's effectiveness.","Data Science; Software Engineering; Education; Education Computing; Engineering Education; Information Management; Students; Data Science; Execution Management; Integrated Tools; Learning Behavior; Science Education; System Levels; User Experience Design; Web-based Tools; Software Engineering","Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Information management; Students; data science; Execution management; Integrated tools; Learning behavior; Science education; System levels; User experience design; Web-based tools; Software engineering","","Hadoop the Definitive Guide, (2009); Zaharia, Matei A., Resilient distributed datasets: A fault-tolerant abstraction for in-memory cluster computing, pp. 15-28, (2012); Isard, Michael, Dryad: Distributed data-parallel programs from sequential building blocks, Operating Systems Review (ACM), pp. 59-72, (2007); Seering, Adam, Efficient versioning for scientific array databases, Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering, pp. 1013-1024, (2012); Khurana, Udayan, Efficient snapshot retrieval over historical graph data, Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering, pp. 997-1008, (2013); Salzberg, Betty, Comparison of access methods for time-evolving data, ACM Computing Surveys, 31, 2, pp. 158-221, (1999); Tsql2 Temporal Query Language, (1995); Foster, Ian T., Chimera: A virtual data system for representing, querying, and automating data derivation, 2002-January, pp. 37-46, (2002); Deelman, Ewa, Pegasus: A framework for mapping complex scientific workflows onto distributed systems, Scientific Programming, 13, 3, pp. 219-237, (2005); Callahan, Steven P., VisTrails: Visualization meets data management, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 745-747, (2006)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9781538626719","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026770911"

The anecdotal evidence suggests this was a mistake: data scientists report spending most of their time grappling with data far upstream of modeling activities. A second wave of data science education is emerging, one with increased emphasis on practical issues in ethics, legal compliance, scientific reproducibility, data quality, and algorithmic bias. The data engineering community has a second chance to influence these programs beyond just providing a set of tools. In this panel, we'll discuss the role of data engineering in data science education programs, and how best to capitalize on emerging opportunities in this space.","Education; Anecdotal Evidences; Data Engineering; Legal Compliance; Practical Issues; Reproducibilities; Scalable Algorithms; Science Education; Statistical Modeling; Information Management","Education; Anecdotal evidences; Data engineering; Legal compliance; Practical issues; Reproducibilities; Scalable algorithms; Science education; Statistical modeling; Information management","","","","IEEE Computer Society help@computer.org","23750286; 10844627","9781424408030; 1424408032; 9781665408837; 9780769535456; 9781509065431; 9781479925544; 081860655X; 1424408326; 0769522858; 0769525709","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021187717"

Data Science education programs are rapidly being created on all levels. Usually it happens through reuse or renaming and can result in curricula that lack proper balance of competences, which balance is necessary for future data scientists. Our quantitative analysis of over 300 programs worldwide shows that at least one of the three core data science competence groups is under-represented in the majority of programs. Moreover, general business courses are often suggested to students to cover the domain competence group, which in most cases results in superficial treatment of this competence group. Our further qualitative analysis demonstrates that learning outcomes for most of the courses are usually not defined or defined improperly.","Cloud Computing; Curricula; Data Analytics; Business Course; Learning Outcome; Qualitative Analysis; Quantitative And Qualitative Analysis; Science Education; Science Programs; Superficial Treatments; Under-represented; Data Science","Cloud computing; Curricula; Data Analytics; Business course; Learning outcome; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative and qualitative analysis; Science education; Science programs; Superficial treatments; Under-represented; Data Science","","College University Datascience Degrees; Building Data Science Profession; Manieri, Andrea, Data science professional uncovered: How the EDISON project will contribute to a widely accepted profile for data scientists, pp. 588-593, (2016); Deliverable D2 1 Data Scientist Competences and Skills Framework Cf Ds and Bok Definition, (2016); Włodarczyk, Tomasz Wiktor, Problem-based learning approach to a course in data intensive systems, Proceedings of the International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science, CloudCom, 2015-February, February, pp. 942-948, (2015)","","IEEE Computer Society help@computer.org","23302186; 23302194","9798350339826; 9781728150116; 9781538678992; 9781509014453; 9798331507589; 9781479940936; 9780738143767; 9781665463676; 9781538606926","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85012996132"

Herein, the authors introduce Multifaceted Rasch Measurement (MFRM) analysis and explain why MFRM must be used when ""judges'"" data are collected. The authors use data from elementary science methods students enrolled in a senior-level, semester-length course. Acting as judges, students used the 23-item Elementary Science Teaching Analysis Matrix (ESTAM) instrument to evaluate five separate science lessons taught by five different teachers. Our MFRM analysis documents that multiple judges need not act as identical robots. Rather, differences in judges' severity can be computed and corrections made in an analysis to take into consideration differing judge severity. This paper extends the current literature in Science Education regarding the application of Rasch measurement.","","","","Abell, Sandra K., Designing and teaching the elementary science methods course, pp. 1-308, (2010); Adams, Paul E., Beginning Science Teacher Cognition and Its Origins in the Preservice Secondary Science Teacher Program, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 34, 6, pp. 633-653, (1997); Alake-Tuenter, Ester, Inquiry-Based Science Education Competencies of Primary School Teachers: A literature study and critical review of the American National Science Education Standards, International Journal of Science Education, 34, 17, pp. 2609-2640, (2012); Beyer, Carrie J., Learning to critique and adapt science curriculum materials: Examining the development of preservice elementary teachers' pedagogical content knowledge, Science Education, 96, 1, pp. 130-157, (2012); Black, Kathie, Science in the trenches: An exploration of four pre-service teachers' first attempts at teaching science in the classroom, International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education, 2, 1, pp. 87-106, (2004); Bond, Trevor G., Applying the rasch model: Fundamental measurement in the human sciences: Second edition, pp. 1-340, (2007); Boone, William John, The role of rasch analysis when conducting science education research utilizing multiple-choice tests, Science Education, 90, 2, pp. 253-269, (2006); Boone, William John, Rasch analysis in the human sciences, pp. 1-482, (2014); Boone, William John, Using Rasch theory to guide the practice of survey development and survey data analysis in science education and to inform science reform efforts: An exemplar utilizing STEBI self-efficacy data, Science Education, 95, 2, pp. 258-280, (2011); Burry-Stock, Judith A., Expert science teaching educational evaluation model (ESTEEM): Measuring excellence in science teaching for professional development, Journal of Personnel Evaluation in Education, 8, 3, pp. 267-297, (1994)","","Wiley-Liss Inc. info@wiley.com","1098237X; 00368326","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958592607"

In this paper we present our experience at hosting and running four datathons that involved students and members from the community coming together to solve challenging problems with data from not-for-profit social good organizations and publicly open data.

Prominent research institutions and private sector industry have embraced data science, but foundations for effective tertiary-level data science education remain absent. This is nothing new, however, as the university has an established tradition of developing its educational mission hand-in-hand with the development of novel methods for human understanding (Feingold, 1991). Thus, it is natural that universities ""figure out"" data science concurrent with the development of needed pedagogy. We consider data science education with respect to recent trends in interdisciplinary and experiential educational methodologies. The first iteration of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) Collaborative, which took place at the University of California, Berkeley in the Spring of 2015, is used as a case study. From this, we draw lessons learned regarding the necessary components of effective tertiary data science education, which range from a complete end-to-end workflow, technological tools for development and team communications, and appropriate motivation and incentives. Our findings will be tested and revised in subsequent iterations of the BIDS Collaborative as we continue our study of data science education, research, and social impact.","Case Study; Data Science; Experiential Learning; Tertiary Education; Data Visualization; Iterative Methods; Data-driven Applications; Educational Methodologies; Experiential Learning; Research Institutions; Technological Tools; Tertiary Education; University Of California , Berkeley; Visualization And Analysis; Data Science","Data visualization; Iterative methods; Data-driven applications; Educational methodologies; Experiential learning; Research institutions; Technological tools; Tertiary education; University of California , Berkeley; Visualization and analysis; Data Science","","Baek, Youngkyun, What makes teachers use technology in the classroom?

It also provides an engaging context in which to learn computational thinking skills in existing classroom contexts. For my dissertation research, I will explore whether and how data science can support inquiry-based learning in social studies. I conjecture that data science could provide students with an opportunity to use computing to better understand their social world, while also allowing students to draw from and make sense of their own experiences. I plan to explore this idea by enhancing and evaluating a software tool, Local Ground, and creating a curriculum that helps young people identify and describe salient characteristics of their lived realities, moving from unstructured to structured data representations (e.g., photos to tags to databases). This process may generate a rich, motivating data source to explore subsequent ideas in computational thinking and social science.","Broadening Participation; Computational Thinking; Data Science Education; Interdisciplinary Approaches; Curricula; Education; Social Sciences; Broadening Participation; Computational Thinkings; Inquiry-based Learning; Interdisciplinary Approaches; Science Education; Structured Data; Support Learning; Young Peoples; Students","Curricula; Education; Social sciences; Broadening participation; Computational thinkings; Inquiry-based learning; Interdisciplinary approaches; Science education; Structured data; Support learning; Young peoples; Students","","Bort, Heather, Introducing computing concepts to non-majors: A case study in gothic novels, pp. 132-137, (2015); Proceedings of Digra, (2009); Edelson, Daniel C., Addressing the Challenges of Inquiry-Based Learning Through Technology and Curriculum Design, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 8, 3-4, pp. 391-450, (1999); Goode, Joanna, Exploring Computer Science: A case study of school reform, ACM Transactions on Computing Education, 11, 2, (2011); Gutiérrez, Kris D., Lifting off the ground to return anew: Mediated praxis, transformative learning, and social design experiments, Journal of Teacher Education, 61, 1-2, pp. 100-117, (2010); Culture Literacy and Learning Taking Bloom in the Midst of the Whirlwind, (2007); Philip, Thomas M., When educators attempt to make ""community"" a part of classroom learning: Thedangers of (mis)appropriating students' communities into schools, Teaching and Teacher Education, 34, pp. 174-183, (2013); Plaue, Christopher, Data journalism: Lessons learned while designing an interdisciplinary service course, pp. 126-131, (2015); van Wart, Sarah, Local ground: A paper-based toolkit for documenting local geo-spatial knowledge, (2010)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc acmhelp@acm.org","","9781450336284","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959306317"

The project focuses on advanced data analytics (ADA) in business management. In the project, advanced data analytics is taught to both students at University of Eastern Finland and to their potential employers at the local organizations. The university teaching favors effective teaching techniques instead of conventional teaching methods, and the same topics are taught to participants from local organizations as shorter versions. The organizations also have an important role in calibrating the teaching via discussions and maturity reviews. Even-though the project is regional there has been great nationwide interest in the project. This indicates the general need for improving know-how on ADA both at universities and in companies and organizations.

Although some conceptions of data science focus primarily on analytical methods, data scientists must also have a deep understanding of how project data were collected, preprocessed and transformed. These processes strongly influence the analytical methods that can be applied, and more importantly how the results of those methods should be interpreted. In the present chapter we provide background information on educational challenges for data scientists and report on the results of a workshop where experts from the information field brainstormed on the educational dimensions of data science. Results of the workshop showed that data scientists must possess a breadth of expertise across three areas - curation, analytics, and cyber-infrastructure - with deep knowledge in at least one of these areas. Workshop participants also underscored the importance of domain knowledge to the success of the data science role. Additionally, the workshop highlighted a factor that differentiates data science from other professional specialties: the emphasis on serving the data needs of information users and decision makers. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","Data Visualization; Information Management; Information Services; Background Information; Cyber Infrastructures; Educational Challenge; Heterogeneous Data; Information Professionals; Information Users; Science Education; Workshop Participants; Metadata","Data visualization; Information management; Information services; Background information; Cyber infrastructures; Educational challenge; Heterogeneous data; Information professionals; Information users; Science education; Workshop participants; Metadata","","Allard, Suzie L., Design engineers and technical professionals at work: Observing information usage in the workplace, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 60, 3, pp. 443-454, (2009); Aaai Spring Symposium on Mining Answers from Texts and Knowledge Bases, (2002); Work at the Boundaries of Science Information and the Interdisciplinary Research Process, (2001); Stanton, Jeffrey M., Using Internet/Intranet Web Pages to Collect Organizational Research Data, Organizational Research Methods, 4, 3, pp. 200-217, (2001); Fourth Paradigm Data Intensive Scientific Discovery, (2009); Big Data the Next Frontier for Innovation Competition and Productivity, (2011); Hey, Tony, The UK e-Science core programme and the grid, Future Generation Computer Systems, 18, 8, pp. 1017-1031, (2002); Revolutionizing Science and Engineering Through Cyberinfrastructure, (2025); Kohavi, Ron, Lessons and challenges from mining retail e-commerce data, Machine Learning, 57, 1-2 SPEC.
