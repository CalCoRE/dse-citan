Accordingly, the book is suitable for teachers and lecturers in all educational frameworks: K-12, academia and industry. This book aims at closing a significant gap in the literature on the pedagogy of data science. While there are many articles and white papers dealing with the curriculum of data science (i.e., what to teach?), the pedagogical aspect of the field (i.e., how to teach?) is almost neglected. At the same time, the importance of the pedagogical aspects of data science increases as more and more programs are currently open to a variety of people. This book provides a variety of pedagogical discussions and specific teaching methods and frameworks, as well as includes exercises, and guidelines related to many data science concepts (e.g., data thinking and the data science workflow), main machine learning algorithms and concepts (e.g., KNN, SVM, Neural Networks, performance metrics, confusion matrix, and biases) and data science professional topics (e.g., ethics, skills and research approach). Professor Orit Hazzan is a faculty member at the Technion’s Department of Education in Science and Technology since October 2000. Her research focuses on computer science, software engineering and data science education. Within this framework, she studies the cognitive and social processes on the individual, the team and the organization levels, in all kinds of organizations. Dr. Koby Mike is a Ph.D. graduate from the Technion's Department of Education in Science and Technology under the supervision of Professor Orit Hazzan. He continued his post-doc research on data science education at the Bar-Ilan University, and obtained a B.Sc. and an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Tel Aviv University. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Computer Science Education;

Data literacy, particularly among underrepresented students, is critical to everyone in this increasingly digital world. However, the integration of data science into K-12 schools is nascent, and the pedagogical training of CS teachers in data science remains limited. Our research-practice partnership modified an existing data science unit to include two pedagogical techniques known to support minoritized students: rich classroom discourse and personally-relevant problem-solving.

Different from some commonly seen model fitting criteria in statistics, such as the ordinary least squares criterion and the maximum likelihood method, its algorithm depends on an optimization problem under constraints, which is unconventional to many students in a second or third course in statistics or data science. As a result, this topic is often not as intuitive to students as some of the more traditional statistical modeling tools. In order to facilitate students’ mastery of the topic and promote active learning, we developed some in-class activities and their accompanying Shiny applications for teaching support vector classifiers. The designed course materials aim at engaging students through group work and solidifying students’ understanding of the algorithm via hands-on explorations. The Shiny applications offer interactive demonstration of the changes of the components of a support vector classifier when altering its determining parameters.

The primary aim of the study was to understand how DSE may be scaled to non-science participants, particularly using immersive DSE training sessions that culminated in a datathon (data science hackathon). The immersion programme was based on a project-based pedagogy informed by the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) to integrate data science's multidisciplinary nature. Quantitative research was used with 107 datathon participants. Using various statistical measures including Exploratory Factor Analysis, the key results revealed that non-science participants who completed the immersions and datathon were sufficiently knowledgeable in all the CRISP-DM components as well as those who attended the full DSE programme. This means data science skills can be attained by non-STEM individuals by spending focused time in immersions on a specific data science concept. In this case, immersion sped up learning as the participants picked up new data science concepts while applying them simultaneously. The study recommends immersions through datathons to encourage transdisciplinary collaborative learning to massify data science skills. © 2023 29th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2023.

Many might begin their exploration by taking a course at a local two-year college. Currently, not many of these institutions in the U.S. offer data science courses. This article introduces the perspective lens of students who have gone through the Montgomery College Data Science Certificate Program. We found that, contrary to many other educational fields at the College, data science students tend to come from diverse backgrounds and career paths. A common theme emerged that all students learned valuable skills and applications such as coding in various programming languages and approaches to machine learning. Other meaningful themes included an appreciation of course accessibility, especially catered toward busy professionals who might only be able to take evening courses. Students appreciated learning that data science and ethics are intertwined. Finally, it was evident that going through the data science program positively impacted the lives and careers of these students. The implications of the themes of these student experiences are discussed as they relate to data science education.

Given the centrality of computing and programming in the contemporary practice of DS, many of these courses include topics historically reserved for computer science (CS) classes. Further, many CS courses include dedicated time for DS topics (e.g., AP Computer Science Principles' unit on Data). In many ways, DS educators and CS educators are working towards the same ends in complementary ways. However, at other times, the two disciplines are in tension, especially given the scarcity of time in K-12 student schedules for non-core subjects. This panel will explore what DS education and CS education can learn from each other, how each can contribute and advance the goals of the other, and how these two intertwined disciplines can productively live alongside each other in K-12 settings. © 2024 Owner/Author.","computer science education; data science education; k-12","Computer programming; Data Science; Education computing; Engineering education; Students; Computer Science Education; Data collection; Data driven; Data science education; K-12; K-12 education; Learn+; Mathematic statistics; Science education; Statistical calculations; Data visualization","","","","","","","LaMar T., Boaler J., The importance and emergence of K-12 data science, Phi Delta Kappan., 103, 1, pp. 49-53, (2021)","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGCSE; Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)","55th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, SIGCSE 2024","20 March 2024 through 23 March 2024","Portland","197936","","979-840070424-6","","","English","SIGCSE - Proc.

The development of human resources for Data Science has become an urgent issue in every aspect of the digitizing society. However, a curriculum to meet the needs in such a digitizing society is not available to higher education in Japan, especially in the realm of liberal arts. In response to the situation required of the approved program for Mathematics, Data Science, and AI Smart Higher education (MDASH), we proposed a conceptual curriculum model for the Data Science education program, which systematically incorporates the knowledge module of Data Science while remedying the weakness in the basic math skills and barriers to be considered in the process of learning Data Science concepts. This paper aims to propose an integrated curriculum based on the conceptual model for the faculty members in a small-sized private liberal arts university, where students lack basic math skills, IT skills, and the basic knowledge of Data Science. Issues consisting of curriculum on knowledge areas and subjects, implementation approach of Data Science education courses, and fusion of Data Science with expertise education are discussed.

The framework is organized around three key dimensions involving engagement & action, knowledge, and enabling processes. It identifies knowledge-bases covering meaning for society and policy and critical evaluation and reflection; selected statistical and mathematical constructs and skills; core literacy and mathematical skills; understanding models and modelling, multivariate ideas and textual and rich visual representations; knowledge of research and data production methods and extensions related to official statistics and risk on the societal level; and it emphasises the importance of appropriate dispositions, critical stance, and habits of mind. We offer examples and curriculum tasks that illustrate each of the 11 facets and their interconnectedness. We also describe the use of a ‘radar plot’ tool to support the analysis of how balanced are prospective class activities or test items in terms of covering the 11 facets and tools. The chapter ends with a brief discussion of the implications of the conceptual model and its 11 facets for planning curricula, instruction, and assessments that can promote teaching and learning about Civic Statistics within mathematics education, statistics and data science education, and related disciplines. © Springer Nature Switzerl and AG 2022.","Citizenship skills; Cognitive task demands; Conceptual framework; Critical statistical literacy; Dispositions and attitudes; Media and data literacy","","","","","","","","Ben-Zvi D., Garfield J.B., The Challenge of Developing Statistical Literacy, Reasoning and Thinking, pp. 3-16, (2004); Boersma S., Diefenderfer C.L., Dingman S.W., Madison B.L., Quantitative reasoning in the contemporary world, 3: Assessing student learning, Numeracy, 4, 2, (2011); Box G., Draper N., Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces, (1987); Callingham R., Watson J.M., The development of statistical literacy at school, Statistics Education Research Journal, 17, 1, pp. 181-201, (2017); Carter J., Nicholson J., Teaching statistical literacy by getting students to use real world data: 40 years worth of experience in 40 minutes, Promoting Understanding of Statistics about Society.

For this purpose, this study proposed and conducted the educational program using epistemic network analysis (ENA) and analyzed students’ reports. The research questions were (1) What do novices learn in introductory QE education? and (2) How do students learn in the proposed educational program? Recently, education for data science and data literacy has been discussed in many countries because data science knowledge and skills have become essential in the 21st century. It is required to develop the educational program in literacy level as well as growing data scientists. Moreover, teaching QE has become a high-profile topic in the QE community. Consequently, I examined the potential of an experiential education program in which novices analyze data by ENA. As a result, the students understood the operation and usefulness of ENA through the course. Besides, they enjoyed interpreting the data with diverse team members.

A mixed-methods approach, integrating focus group interviews and questionnaire surveys conducted over three rounds of data collection, was employed. The collected data underwent rigorous reliability and validity analyses utilizing SPSS software. An Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) was executed to construct a performance chart, evaluating the effectiveness of a 24-item framework designed to encompass key aspects of data science education. The initial internal consistency α coefficients for Questionnaire 2 and Questionnaire 3 were found to be .892 and .913, respectively, surpassing the 0.7 threshold, indicating a high level of reliability for all items related to data science competencies. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measurements approaching approximately 0.9 affirmed the efficiency of the questionnaire, specifically designed to gauge the relevance and effectiveness of data science-related indicators in the context of applied talent cultivation and regional economic development. Furthermore, the study underscores the significance of indicators such as teamwork, regional market research, and business opportunity identification within the domain of data science. It identifies gaps between key indicators and lower-performing indicators, proposing strategic improvement measures to enhance the alignment of applied talent cultivation objectives with the evolving needs of regional economic development, particularly in the data science landscape. The research findings not only contribute to a foundational understanding of data science competencies in applied talent cultivation but also lay the groundwork for innovative reforms in future talent cultivation models. By clarifying objectives and better aligning them with the dynamic demands of regional economic development, this study sets the stage for transformative advancements in the field of applied talent cultivation, particularly within the realm of data science. © Authors retain all copyrights.","Applied Talent Cultivation; Data Science Competencies; Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA); Regional Economic Development","","","","","","","","Bian Y.

However, in conventional education systems, computing & quantitative, and communication skills are often taught in different disciplines. Data storytelling is constructing and presenting data stories to highlight the analytical insights to achieve the communication goals to a specific audience. Digital data storytelling leverages digital storytelling techniques and best practices in communication to deliver stories that can be shared in digital formats to a wide audience. In this paper, we describe and reflect on a semester-long project-based learning pilot using Digital Storytelling as a framework to allow students to explore topics themed around human flourishing and sustainability with the end goal of constructing data stories delivered in digital or video format (i.e., Digital Data Storytelling). The pilot work was conducted in an introductory data science course at a 4-year Minority Serving Institution in collaboration with students studying non-STEM disciplines at a partner community college. Our pilot demonstrates the potential benefit of this sustainability-aware Project-Based Learning design in raising students’ awareness of sustainability issues, increasing confidence in cross-disciplinary communication competency, and at the same time deepening their understanding of data science concepts. We further reflect on the significant role of an effective program model as well as challenges and opportunities for building transdisciplinary communication competency to prepare for a diverse data science workforce. © 2023, Aalborg University press.

At the same time, there is increasing interest in using temporal and sequential analysis to describe and understand learner behaviour, but current work is mostly exploratory, with promising potential for educational interventions. Obtaining sequential patterns from learner data can provide insights into processes that can be missed by descriptive analytics, where the order and timing of actions make a difference. A current scenario is in practical exercises in Data Science Education where teachers cannot access the learners' development process and are therefore unable to properly assess them or provide detailed feedback. Furthermore, there are phases of data science that may not generate data records, such as setting an objective, or intermediate evaluation and reflection. The introduction of Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Github Copilot) as coding assistants has the potential to obtain such data in the form of conversation. By using learning sequence analytics on the interactions between LLM and learners, integrated with the data traces in their programming and analytics environments, we can identify and understand behavioural patterns that can be used to assess, monitor and support the learning process in Data Science Education. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

In this study, we ascertained the impact of data science and AI education on learners’ motivation and career development by analyzing a lecture-style course offered as part of mathematical and data science education at Tokyo City University, Japan. The course analyzed was Data Science Literacy 1 (DS1). The analysis period spanned three academic years, from 2020 to 2022. The analyzed items were three motivational factors derived from expectancy-value theory, namely intrinsic value, attainment utility value, and expectations for success. A fourth factor, career development, was also analyzed. We collected data pertaining to the four factors, that is, the three above mentioned motivational factors and career development, through questionnaires administered to DS1 learners. Regarding data analysis, learners were clas-sified according to the values (high vs. low) they reported for each of the four factors of interest at the beginning of the course. These were compared to the values reported at the end of the course. Results showed increases in all the motivation factors. The increasing trend was particularly pronounced among learners who initially reported low values. Although trends differed from year to year, the results suggest that data science and AI education can positively impact motivational factors and related career development. © 2023, ICIC International.

It is vital to ensure that all students have access to the necessary learning resources. While gender bias in STEM has received significant attention, research on racial bias is relatively limited, and the combined effects of gender and racial biases in Data Science remain largely unexplored. The objective of this study is to investigate these biases in Data Science education by examining the preferences of 300 diverse students enrolled in Data Science related classes, with a specific focus on their preferences regarding teaching practices and methods. The impact of race and gender in Data Science education is an important area of study that has gained increased attention in recent years. Race and gender play a critical role in representation within the Data Science community. Stereotypes and biases can influence the experiences of individuals from different racial and gender backgrounds within Data Science education. Race and gender can impact data science pedagogy in various ways, influencing instructional practices, content delivery, and student experiences. Using machine learning techniques to understand biased pedagogy in data science education can be a valuable approach to uncover patterns and insights. We propose an effective unsupervised learning approach to examine the correlations between preferred pedagogical methods and gender-racial background of the participating students. Our findings show that student's gender has a significant correlation with learning style; e.g., female students prefer more private methods of interaction with TAs and instructors, such as anonymous polls and Zoom meetings. Furthermore, our study uncovers significant associations between race, gender, and learning styles, showing that Asian students exhibit higher levels of Classroom Interaction and Group Assignment Preference than their White counterparts. These findings are crucial for Data Science educators seeking to identify and address racial and gender biases, promoting a more inclusive and equitable learning environment, especially for underrepresented minorities. Recognizing these influences enables educators to implement targeted strategies for a supportive and engaging educational experience for all students. © 2023 IEEE.","","Association reactions; Computer aided instruction; Data Science; Learning systems; Combined effect; Gender bias; Gender equity; Government initiatives; Learning resource; Learningstyles; Racial bias; Science education; STEM fields; Teaching practices; Students","","","","","","","Argyriou P., Benamar K., Nikolajeva M., What to Blend?

In Japanese university students’ standard data science curriculum, group work based on AI application examples is recommended to motivate students to learn data science. All university students who have just graduated from high school may not have sufficient basic data science knowledge, and their understanding of its importance may differ from person to person. Under these circumstances, it is unclear whether an introduction to AI applications would be practical as an introductory education to data science. Therefore, in this study, we designed a lesson including group work based on a case study of using AI technology in job interviews. Although first-year university students’ willingness to learn AI differed by department, we found that their motivation in learning AI increased after the lesson. © 2024 Information Processing Society of Japan.","AI education; group discussion; undergraduate programs","","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (21K20266); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS","Acknowledgments Takahiro Sumiya and Yasushi Nagato conducted the lesson.

The present chapter examines issues that are essential for promoting necessary changes in the teaching and learning of Civic Statistics, which are needed for empowering citizens to engage with and analyze data sources and data-informed reasoning about burning issues in society, and critically interpret messages related to Civic Statistics encountered in the news media, social networks and related digital sources. The chapter first provides further illustrations of activities or tasks pertaining to Civic Statistics and shows how to analyse task demands in terms of the facets and tools they require. Then, general questions are examined regarding the all-important alignment of the features of Civic Statistics and their demands with curriculum plans and learning goals, classroom teaching practices, and assessment methods. We provide some guidelines for developing assessment items relevant to Civic Statistics. Finally, the chapter presents six broad recommendations related to changes in systemic issues that can promote attention to and critical understanding of Civic Statistics, at the school and university levels, and which can improve effective instruction and assessment in this regard, within mathematics education, statistics and data science education, and related disciplines. © Springer Nature Switzerl and AG 2022.","Curriculum alignment; Data literacy; Media literacy; Statistical literacy; Statistics education","","","","","","","","Bargagliotti A., Franklin C., Arnold P., Gould R., Johnson S., Perez L., Spangler D., Pre-K-12 Guidelines for assessment and instruction in statistics education (GAISE) report II, American Statistical Association and National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, (2020); Guidelines for assessment and instruction in statistics education: College report, American Statistical Association, (2016); Gal I., Ograjensek I., Official statistics and statistics education: Bridging the gap, Journal of Official Statistics, 33, 1, pp. 79-100, (2017); Engaging civic statistics: A call for action and recommendations, A Product of the Procivicstat Project, (2018); Ridgway J., Implications of the data revolution for statistics education, International Statistical Review, 84, 3, pp. 528-549, (2016); Ridgway J., Nicholson J., Gal I., Task analysis tool: Facets of statistical literacy, Prepared for a Procivicstat Workshop at the IASE Satellite Conference, (2017); Making data meaningful: A guide to improving statistical literacy, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, (2012)","I.

Considering this, educators should be equipped to prepare future data scientists, but also data literate citizens. This project engages high school students in the real-world practice of data analytics to promote the public interest. The research team is partnering with a local public STEM high school to design, evaluate, and publicly share an enrichment course that introduces students to data analytics in the context of public health. Integrating data science education and public health will enable students to engage in meaningful data-driven problem solving while promoting civic engagement. A key challenge in introducing data skills in K-12 is addressing barriers to access. To cope with these barriers, the course design incorporates the use of spreadsheets to engage students in computational thinking. This poster will present preliminary assessment results from the 3-week enrichment course conducted in January 2024. This project contributes to the ongoing discussion of K-12 data science education by demonstrating the value of contextualizing data science as a key competency for 21st century public service. © 2024 Owner/Author.","civic engagement; data science; public health; public interest technology; spreadsheets","Curricula; Data Analytics; Data Science; Public health; Students; Civic engagement; Data analytics; High demand; High school students; Pilot course; Public interest; Public interest technology; Real-world practice; Research teams; Science education; Spreadsheets","","","","","","","Chapman P., Clinton J., Kerber R., Khabaza T., Reinartz T., Shearer C., Wirth R., CRISP-DM 1.0, (1999); Support K-12 Computer Science Education in Ohio, (2023); Duffey M., Wiseman J., Evans Gaier K., Report of the State Committee on Computer Science, (2022); Gebre E., Conceptions and perspectives of data literacy in secondary education, British Journal of Educational Technology, 53, 5, pp. 1080-1095, (2022); Jonas O., Parry I., Chrisholm D., Banatvala N., Laxminarayan R., Global health threats of the 21st century, Finance & Development, 51, 4, (2014); Dawson McGuinness T., Schank H., Power to the public: The promise of public interest technology, (2021); Roman-Gonzalez M., Perez-Gonzalez J.-C., Jimenez-Fernandez C., Which cognitive abilities underlie computational thinking?

Prior work on similar AI models has shown that they perform well on typical intro-level Computer Science problems. However, little is known about the performance of such tools on Data Science (DS) problems. In this work, we assess the performance of ChatGPT on assignments from three DS courses with varying difficulty levels. First, we apply the raw assignment prompts provided to the students and find that ChatGPT performs well on assignments with dataset(s) descriptions and progressive question prompts, which divide the programming requirements into sub-problems. Then, we perform prompt engineering on the assignments for which ChatGPT had low performance. We find that the following prompt engineering techniques significantly increased ChatGPT's performance: breaking down abstract questions into steps, breaking down steps into multiple prompts, providing descriptions of the dataset(s), including algorithmic details, adding specific instructions to entice specific actions, and removing extraneous information. Finally, we discuss how our findings suggest potential changes to curriculum design of DS courses.  © 2024 ACM.","data science education; large language models; prompt engineering","Data Science; Education computing; Breakings; Data science education; Language model; Large language model; Natural languages; Performance; Prompt engineering; Question prompts; Science course; Science education; Curricula","","","","","","","OpenAI ChatGPT, (2023); Prompt Engineering: Learn How to Use Ai Models with Prompt Engineering, (2023); Arora S., Narayan A., Chen M.F., Orr L.J., Guha N., Bhatia K., Chami I., Sala F., Re C., Ask Me Anything: A Simple Strategy for Prompting Language Models, (2022); Austin J., Odena A., Nye M., Bosma M., Michalewski H., Dohan D., Jiang E., Cai C., Terry Quoc Le M., Et al., Program Synthesis with Large Language Models, (2021); Baidoo-Anu D., Owusu Ansah L., Education in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI): Understanding the Potential Benefits of ChatGPT in Promoting Teaching and Learning, (2023); Becker B.A., Denny P., Finnie-Ansley J., Luxton-Reilly A., Prather J., Antonio Santos E., Programming Is Hard-Or at Least It Used to Be: Educational Opportunities and Challenges of AI Code Generation, Proceedings of the 54th Acm Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V. 1 (Toronto ON, Canada) (SIGCSE 2023), pp. 500-506, (2023); Biderman S., Raff E., Fooling MOSS Detection with Pretrained Language Models, Proceedings of the 31st Acm International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management (Atlanta, GA, USA) (CIKM '22), pp. 2933-2943, (2022); Brown T., Mann B., Ryder N., Subbiah M., Kaplan J.D., Dhariwal P., Neelakantan A., Shyam P., Sastry G., Askell A., Agarwal S., Herbert-Voss A., Krueger G., Henighan T., Child R., Ramesh A., Ziegler D., Wu J., Winter C., Hesse C., Chen M., Sigler E., Litwin M., Gray S., Chess B., Clark J., Berner C., McCandlish S., Radford A., Sutskever I., Amodei D., Language Models are Few-Shot Learners, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 1877-1901, (2020); Caraza-Harter T., Syamkumar M., Data Science Programming Ii, (2023); Chandel S., Clement C.B., Serrato G., Sundaresan N., Training and Evaluating a Jupyter Notebook Data Science Assistant, (2022); Chen M., Tworek J., Jun H., Yuan Q., De Oliveira Pinto H.P., Kaplan J., Edwards H., Burda Y., Joseph N., Brockman G., Et al., Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code, (2021); Denny P., Kumar V., Giacaman N., Conversing with Copilot: Exploring Prompt Engineering for Solving CS1 Problems Using Natural Language, Proceedings of the 54th Acm Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V. 1 (Toronto ON, Canada) (SIGCSE 2023), pp. 1136-1142, (2023); Donoghue T., Voytek B., Ellis S., Data Science in Practice, (2020); Finnie-Ansley J., Denny P., Becker B.A., Luxton-Reilly A., Prather J., The Robots Are Coming: Exploring the Implications of OpenAI Codex on Introductory Programming, Proceedings of the 24th Australasian Computing Education Conference (Virtual Event, Australia) (ACE '22), pp. 10-19, (2022); Hendrycks D., Basart S., Kadavath S., Mazeika M., Arora A., Guo E., Burns C., Puranik S., He H., Song D., Steinhardt J., Measuring Coding Challenge Competence with APPS, Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems Track on Datasets and Benchmarks, 1, (2021); Khan T., What Are Tokens and How to Count Them?; Lai Y., Li C., Wang Y., Zhang T., Zhong R., Zettlemoyer L., Yih W., Fried D., Wang S., Yu T., DS-1000: A Natural and Reliable Benchmark for Data Science Code Generation, Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Machine Learning (Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 202, pp. 18319-18345, (2023); Lake B., Baroni M., Generalization without Systematicity: On the Compositional Skills of Sequence-to-Sequence Recurrent Networks, Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Machine Learning (Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 80, pp. 2873-2882, (2018); Leinonen J., Hellas A., Sarsa S., Reeves B., Denny P., Prather J., Becker B.A., Using Large Language Models to Enhance Programming Error Messages, Proceedings of the 54th Acm Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V. 1 (Toronto ON, Canada) (SIGCSE 2023), pp. 563-569, (2023); MacNeil S., Tran A., Hellas A., Kim J., Sarsa S., Denny P., Bernstein S., Leinonen J., Experiences from Using Code Explanations Generated by Large Language Models in a Web Software Development E-Book, Proceedings of the 54th Acm Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V. 1 (Toronto ON, Canada) (SIGCSE 2023), pp. 931-937, (2023); McAuley J., Cse 158/258: Web Mining and Recommender Systems, (2022); Moradi Dakhel A., Majdinasab V., Nikanjam A., Khomh F., Desmarais M.C., Jack Jiang Z.M., GitHub Copilot AI Pair Programmer: Asset or Liability?, J.

A digital divide separates scientists who accelerate their science using large cyberinfrastructure from those who do not, or who do not have access to the compute resources or learning opportunities to develop the skills needed. The exclusionary nature of the digital divide threatens equity and the future of innovation by leaving people out of the scientific process while over-amplifying the voices of a small group who have resources. However, there are potential solutions: recent advancements in public research cyberinfrastructure and resources developed during the open science revolution are providing tools that can help bridge this divide. These tools can enable access to fast and powerful computation with modest internet connections and personal computers. Here we contribute another resource for narrowing the digital divide: scalable virtual machines running on public cloud infrastructure. We describe the tools, infrastructure, and methods that enabled successful deployment of a reproducible and scalable cyberinfrastructure architecture for a collaborative data synthesis working group in February 2023. This platform enabled 45 scientists with varying data and compute skills to leverage 40,000 hours of compute time over a 4-day workshop. Our approach provides an open framework that can be replicated for educational and collaborative data synthesis experiences in any data- and compute-intensive discipline.  © 2023 Owner/Author.","cyberinfrastructure; digital equity; open science; team science","E-learning; Open Data; Cyberinfrastructure; Data synthesis; Digital divide; Digital equity; Environmental data; Modern science; Open science; Public research; Science education; Team science; Personal computers","","","","","CU Boulder’s Grand Challenge Initiative; ESIIL; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DBI-0735191, DBI-1265383, DBI-1743442, DBI-2153040, DEB-1846384, DEB-2017889, OAC-2137603, OAC-2138259, OAC-2138286, OAC-2138296, OAC-2138307); Indiana University, IU, (BIO220085); Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, CIRES; EarthLab, University of Washington","Funding text 1: The working group was supported by the Environmental Data Synthesis Innovation and Inclusion Lab (ESIIL, NSF award DBI-2153040) and additional NSF grants DEB-2017889 and DEB-1846384.

In collaboration with 17 experts, selected through purposive sampling, and involving 100 instructors within Sichuan, China, this research explores an instructional model designed to foster self-regulated learning in the field of data science. The Delphi data collection method is employed to investigate the relevance of various learning theories within international higher education in Sichuan Province, China, with a specific emphasis on the data science discipline. The Self-Regulated Learning in International Higher Education (SLR-IHE) model, informed by survey questionnaires, addresses pertinent challenges encountered in data science education, including issues related to English language proficiency, faculty training, curriculum development, faculty mobility, cross-border regulations, and funding constraints. The findings of this study lead to the development of an International Higher Education (IHE) Model for Sichuan Province, China, using the Delphi Technique, which consists of four distinct instructional modules. Through a linear regression analysis of the SLR-IHE model, it becomes evident that the self-regulated learning process in data science education comprises four essential stages, each contributing to the acquisition of distinct goals. These stages include: (1) activating prior knowledge; (2) fostering idea exchange and iterative improvement; (3) building organizational knowledge through understanding, memorization, analysis, and transfer; and (4) generating innovative ideas through reflexive thinking and initiating creative thought processes. These stages collectively support the achievement of specific goals associated with Self-Managed Learning (SML), Self-Regulated Learning (SRL), Self-Paced Learning (SPL), and Self-Directed Learning (SDL) in the context of data science education. This comprehensive instructional model for data science education within the framework of international higher education development in Sichuan Province, China, emphasizes globalization, collaborative efforts, and economic growth as key drivers for enhancing the quality of education in the field of data science. © 2023, Bright Publisher.

The report ""Data Science Curriculum in iField"" （iDSCC Report）released by the iSchools Data Science Curriculum Committee gives the viewpoints of iField. [Design/Methodology] This study systematically combs the research methods and findings of the iDSCC Report, and analyzes the main conclusions and opinions. [Findings/Conclusion] The iDSCC Report concluded that the core characteristics of iField data science education include transdisciplinary, human-centered, forward-looking qualities, and its attention to how DS is taught; the core competencies of data science talents are reflected in human-centered thinking and data literacy; undergraduate and graduate education preservesome differences at the hierarchy, while keeping common foundation; and iField data science education will face several challenges in future development. [Originality/Value] Inspired by the iDSCC Report, this paper proposes that the domestic field of Information resources management should develop an iField data science education path with Chinese characteristics based on the Chinese context, keeping the original intention of Library and Information Science, combining the approaches of curriculum ideology and politics and university-industry collaborative education. © The Author(s) 2023.","Data literacy;

Given that educational designers often privilege authenticity, the purpose of this study is to examine how teachers use features of data sets to determine their suitability for authentic data science learning experiences with their students. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews with 12 practicing high school mathematics and statistics teachers were conducted and video-recorded. Teachers were given two different data sets about the same context and asked to explain which one would be better suited for an authentic data science experience. Following knowledge analysis methods, the teachers’ responses were coded and iteratively reviewed to find themes that appeared across multiple teachers related to their aesthetic judgments. Findings: Three aspects of authenticity for data sets for this task were identified. These include thinking of authentic data sets as being “messy,” as requiring more work for the student or analyst to pore through than other data sets and as involving computation. Originality/value: Analysis of teachers’ aesthetics of data sets is a new direction for work on data literacy and data science education. The findings invite the field to think critically about how to help teachers develop new aesthetics and to provide data sets in curriculum materials that are suited for classroom use. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Aesthetics; Data literacy; Data science education; Data sets; Knowledge analysis; Teacher thinking","","","","","","","","Batanero C., Burrill G., Reading C., Teaching Statistics in School Mathematics-Challenges for Teaching and Teacher Education, (2011); Clarke V., Braun V., Thematic analysis, The Journal of Positive Psychology, 12, 3, pp. 297-298, (2017); Conway D., The data science Venn diagram [online], (2013); Delaney V., Lee V.R., With statistics, that’s supposed to take bias away: divergent teacher views on engaging students with race in data sets, Proceedings of the 16th International Conference of the Learning Sciences-ICLS 2022, pp. 1401-1404, (2022); diSessa A.A., Knowledge in pieces, Constructivism in the computer Age, (1988); diSessa A.A., Toward an epistemology of physics, Cognition and Instruction, 10, 2-3, pp. 105-225, (1993); diSessa A.A., Sherin B., What changes in conceptual change?, International Journal of Science Education, 20, 10, pp. 1155-1191, (1998); diSessa A.A., Gillespie N.M., Esterly J.B., Coherence versus fragmentation in the development of the concept of force, Cognitive Science, 28, 6, pp. 843-900, (2004); diSessa A.A., Levin M., Brown N., Knowledge and Interaction: A Synthetic Agenda for the Learning Sciences, (2016); diSessa A.A., Sherin B., Levin M., Knowledge analysis: an introduction, Knowledge and Interaction: A Synthetic Agenda for the Learning Sciences, (2016); Domahs F., Moeller K., Huber S., Willmes K., Nuerk H.-C., Embodied numerosity: implicit hand-based representations influence symbolic number processing across cultures, Cognition, 116, 2, pp. 251-266, (2010); Edelson D.C., My world: a case study in adapting scientists’ tools for learners, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Learning Sciences, (2004); Edelson D.C., Reiser B.J., Making authentic practices accessible to learners: design challenges and strategies, The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences, (2006); Erickson T., Chen E., Introducing data science with data moves and CODAP, Teaching Statistics, 43, S1, pp. S124-S132, (2021); Erickson T., (2017); Gould R., Toward data-scientific thinking, Teaching Statistics, 43, S1, pp. S11-S22, (2021); Gould R., Machado S., Johnson T.A., Molynoux J., Introduction to Data Science v 5.0, (2018); Hammer D., Elby A., Scherr R.E., Redish E.F., Resources, framing, and transfer, Transfer of Learning from a Modern Multidisciplinary Perspective, (2005); Hazzan O., Ragonis N., Lapidot T., Data science and computer science education, Guide to Teaching Computer Science: An Activity-Based Approach, pp. 95-117, (2020); Jiang S., Lee V.R., Rosenberg J.M., Data science education across the disciplines: underexamined opportunities for K-12 innovation, British Journal of Educational Technology, 53, 5, pp. 1073-1079, (2022); Lave J., Murtaugh M., de la Rocha O., The dialectic of arithmetic in grocery shopping, Everyday Cognition: It's Development in Social Context, (1984); Lee V.R., Delaney V., Identifying the content, lesson structure, and data use within pre-collegiate data science curricula, Journal of Science Education and Technology, 31, 1, pp. 81-98, (2022); Lee V.R., Wilkerson M.H., Lanouette K., A call for a humanistic stance toward K-12 data science education, Educational Researcher, 50, 9, pp. 664-672, (2021); Murata A., Paths to learning ten-structured understandings of teen sums: addition solution methods of Japanese grade 1 students, Cognition and Instruction, 22, 2, pp. 185-218, (2004); Cultivating Interest and Competencies in Computing: Authentic Experiences and Design Factors, (2021); Newman G.E., The psychology of authenticity, Review of General Psychology, 23, 1, pp. 8-18, (2019); Nickerson R.S., The production and perception of randomness, Psychological Review, 109, 2, pp. 330-357, (2002); Parnafes O., What does ‘fast’ mean?

The move is prompted by research that shows data science is a great tool to broaden participation in CS because it offers students an opportunity to apply their computing knowledge to socially relevant problems. Broadening participation, particularly among underrepresented students, is critical to the future health and stability of the field. However, data science is still a relatively new in the context of K-12 schools and few CS teachers are pedagogically trained in data science. In order to test whether or not data science can be a tool to increase student representation in CS and help schools implement more data science curriculum, our project partnered with a local school district to modify an existing data science unit. This work explores the process of how our research practice partnership tackled the development of the new data science unit. © 2022 Owner/Author.","data science; data science education; middle school","Curricula; Data Science; Feedback; Broadening participation; CS education; Data science education; K-12 schools; Middle school; Science education; Student feedback; Teacher feedback; Teachers'; Underrepresented students; Students","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2122485)","This work is supported by the National Science Foundation Award #2122485.

Analysis of writing from the students shows that students are very positive about the course, appreciating the relevance of the content, the opportunity to investigate ideas, the chance to learn challenging, applied content, and the opportunity to think creatively. In an assessment of data and functions given to students in data science and Algebra 2 courses, the students in data science scored at significantly higher levels. © 2024 The Author(s).

However, many ITS rely heavily on expert design and hand-crafted rules. This makes them difficult to build and transfer across domains and limits their potential efficacy. In this paper, we investigate how feedback in a large-scale ITS can be automatically generated in a data-driven way, and more specifically how personalization of feedback can lead to improvements in student performance outcomes. First, in this paper we propose a machine learning approach to generate personalized feedback in an automated way, which takes individual needs of students into account, while alleviating the need of expert intervention and design of hand-crafted rules. We leverage state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to provide students with personalized feedback using hints and Wikipedia-based explanations. Second, we demonstrate that personalized feedback leads to improved success rates at solving exercises in practice: our personalized feedback model is used in Korbit, a large-scale dialogue-based ITS with around 20,000 students launched in 2019. We present the results of experiments with students and show that the automated, data-driven, personalized feedback leads to a significant overall improvement of 22.95% in student performance outcomes and substantial improvements in the subjective evaluation of the feedback. © 2021, The Author(s).","Data science education;

Increasing the accessibility of data science to these communities not only benefits the individuals entering data science, but also increases the field's innovation and potential impact as a whole. Education is the most scalable solution to meet these needs, but many data science educators lack formal training in education. Our group has led education efforts for a variety of audiences: from professional scientists to high school students to lay audiences. These experiences have helped form our teaching philosophy which we have summarized into three main ideals: 1) motivation, 2) inclusivity, and 3) realism. 20 we also aim to iteratively update our teaching approaches and curriculum as we find ways to better reach these ideals. In this manuscript we discuss these ideals as well practical ideas for how to implement these philosophies in the classroom.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to reveal the reality of data science education in the Middle East and to determine the opportunities and challenges for teaching data science in the region. Thirteen countries in the Middle East were offering 48 data science programmes at the time of the study. The results reveal that these data science programmes significantly use the words ‘data’ and ‘analytics’ in their names. With regard to the academic affiliations of the data science programmes, the study found that they are offered in a variety of schools, especially computer science, information technology and business. Moreover, the study found that computer science is the dominant trend in the programmes. Data science programmes have a significant overlap with other programmes, especially statistics and computer science, because of the interdisciplinary nature of this field. Data science schools in the Middle East differ in terms of their programme titles, programme descriptions, course catalogues, curriculum structures and course objectives. Broadly, this study may be useful for those who are seeking to establish a data science programme or to strengthen data science curricula at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. © The Author(s) 2021.","Arabian Gulf countries; curriculum analysis; data analytics; Data science; data science education; Middle East","","","","","","","","Aasheim C.L., Williams S., Rutner P., Et al., Data analytics vs data science: A study of similarities and differences in undergraduate programs based on course descriptions, Journal of Information Systems Education, 26, 2, pp. 103-115, (2015); Master of Science in Business Analytics, (2022); Agarwal R., Dhar V., Big data, data science, and analytics: The opportunity and challenge for IS research, Information Systems Research, 25, 3, pp. 443-448, (2014); Ahmad K., Zheng J., Rafi M., An analysis of academic librarians competencies and skills for implementation of big data analytics in libraries: A correlational study, Data Technologies and Applications, 53, 2, pp. 201-216, (2019); Bachelor degree in data science and artificial intelligence, (2022); Alarcon-Soto Y., Espasandin-Dominguez J., Guler I., Et al., (2019); Artandi S., An Introduction to Computers in Information Science, (1972); Barlas P., Lanning I., Heavey C., A survey of open source data science tools, International Journal of Intelligent Computing and Cybernetics, 8, 3, pp. 232-261, (2015); Bennett T.D., Callahan T.J., Feinstein J.A., Et al., Data science for child health, Journal of Pediatrics, 208, pp. 12-22, (2019); Borne K.D., Jacoby S., Carney K., Et al., The revolution in astronomy education: Data science for the masses, (2009); Bussaban K., Waraporn P., Preparing undergraduate students majoring in computer science and mathematics with data science perspectives and awareness in the age of big data, Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences, 197, pp. 1443-1446, (2015); Calzon B., Why data driven decision making is your path to business success.

Recent publications have criticized the use of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools in the classroom, with little focus on the potential benefits. This article focuses on the potential of ChatGPT as an educational tool for statistics and data science. It encourages readers to consider the history of trepidation surrounding introducing new technology in the classroom, such as the calculator. We explore the possibility of leveraging ChatGPT’s capabilities in statistics and data science education, providing examples of how ChatGPT can aid in developing course materials and suggestions for how educators can prompt students to interact with ChatGPT responsibly. As educators, we can guide the use of generative AI tools in statistics and data science classrooms so that students and educators can leverage the benefits of this technology. © 2023 The Author(s).

Although various tools and services such as Jupyter Notebook and Google Cloud's AI have been developed for building and training models, they are not suitable for direct use in educational settings. For example, teachers expect a platform where they can easily distribute and grade programming assignments, and students want to quickly start coding and training models without the burden of setting up an environment. To this end, we develop MLadder, an online training system for machine learning and data science education. Specifically, we seamlessly integrate two open-source software, CodaLab and Jupyter Notebook, which are used for hosting assignments and building models, respectively. Moreover, we devise several methods to make the system lightweight and scalable, so that it can be deployed on-premises even with limited resources. We have used MLadder in the machine learning and data science courses in our school and facilitated both teaching and learning. © 2022 ACM.","educational support; kubernetes; machine learning education; online systems","Data Science; E-learning; Education computing; Machine learning; Open source software; Open systems; Teaching; Building model; Educational support; Kubernetes; Machine data; Machine learning education; Machine-learning; Online training; Science education; Training model; Training Systems; Online systems","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62137001)","This work is supported by the grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62137001).","Bernstein D., Containers and cloud: From lxc to docker to kubernetes, IEEE Cloud Computing, 1, 3, pp. 81-84, (2014); Deng J., Dong W., Socher R., Li L.-J., Li K., Fei-Fei L., Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database, 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper describes a pedagogical approach that uses a data science framework the research team developed to assist teachers in providing data science instruction to elementary-aged students. Using phenomenological case study methodology, the authors use classroom observations, student focus groups, video recordings and artifacts to detail ways learners engage in data science practices and understand how they perceive their engagement during activities and learning. Findings: Findings suggest student engagement in data science is enhanced when data problems are contextualized and connected to students’ lived experiences; data analysis and data-based decision-making is practiced in multiple ways; and students are given choices to communicate patterns, interpret graphs and tell data stories. The authors note challenges students experienced with data practices including conflict between inconsistencies in data patterns and lived experiences and focusing on data visualization appearances versus relationships between variables. Originality/value: Data science instruction in elementary schools is an understudied, emerging and important area of data science education. Most elementary schools offer limited data science instruction; few elementary schools offer data science curriculum with embedded CT practices integrated across disciplines. This research assists elementary educators in fostering children's data science engagement and agency while developing their ability to reason, visualize and make decisions with data. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Connected learning;

But Data Science practices have far outstripped the field's ethical safeguards. We argue that Data Science graduate education programs must address this critical problem. In this theoretical and conceptual paper, we posit an ordinary macroethics that we call data flourishing. We contend that this macroethics is most appropriately developed through a holistic, human-centered data science (HCDS)-based pedagogy that concentrates on cultivating communities of ethical practice (COEPs) through social learning. We favor embedding this macroethics throughout iField programs' graduate data science curricula and by extension, the entire data science education enterprise. This paper aligns with the 2023 ASIS&T annual meeting theme of translating research into practice, particularly the subthemes of “improving decision-making” and “understanding the power of information to develop human happiness, equality, and wellbeing.”.

Over the next several decades, the world's reliance on cloud computing and big data will continuously increase, and new data-centric technologies and engineering approaches will be developed. Due to this rapidly developing field, there is a need to track these trends and incorporate the corresponding developments into our current science and engineering curriculum. Besides data science skills already taught in traditional engineering curricula, such as mathematical, computational, and statistical foundations, the National Academies guide discusses that key concepts in developing data acumen include domain-specific considerations and ethical problem-solving. This work-in-progress (WIP) paper will highlight the foundation of a comprehensive study to explore data science education in two domain-specific programs: material science and engineering and architectural engineering. This project is broken down into the following objectives: 1) facilitate data science education and workforce development for engineering and related topics, 2) provide opportunities for students to participate in practical experiences where they can learn new skills through opportunities in new settings to transform data science education, and 3) expand the data science talent pool by enabling the participation of undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds, experiences, skills, and technical maturity. The paper will focus on the topics, deployment strategies within courses and curricula, establishing data sets, representative examples of work-in-progress efforts and their success. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.","contextualized learning; data science education; modular course materials; workforce development","Data Science; Engineering education; Personnel; Students; Contextualized learning; Course material; Data science education; Domain specific; Engineering curriculum; Modular course material; Modulars; Science education; Undergraduate students; Workforce development; Curricula","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (IIS-2123343)","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant IIS-2123343.

In introductory data science courses, however, students have found these transformations particularly challenging to learn. One complex transformation is the pivot transformation, which reorganizes a table based on aggregation and summarizing along selected columns and rows. Current assessments test student understanding in static scenarios. Thus, there is an opportunity to help students explicitly work through the steps and variables needed to express a pivot transformation in a randomizable manner. As such, we explore whether a dynamic digital assessment for the pivot transformation can effectively achieve mastery learning towards this skill. Our design is inspired by Parsons problems, in which answer components (pivot table output labels and values) can be composed into the output of a pivot transformation. A question can be derived from a small randomized dataset, and randomized Pandas code that operates upon the dataset and can be autograded. We plan to conduct a pilot study with data science students to investigate whether 1) using a programmable online platform to practice pivot tables helps improve performance on exams, and 2) randomization and instant feedback on the online platform contribute to improved student learning. © 2024 Owner/Author.","data science education; educational tools; mastery learning","Data Science; Education computing; 'current; Complex transformations; Data science education; Educational tools; Learn+; Mastery learning; Online platforms; Pivot-tables; Science course; Science education; Students","","","","","","","Alkhabaz R., Li Z., Yang S., Alawini A., Student's Learning Challenges with Relational, Document, and Graph Query Languages, Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Data Systems Education: Bridging Education Practice with Education Research (Seattle, WA, USA) (DataEd '23), pp. 30-36, (2023); Berman F., Rutenbar R., Hailpern B., Christensen H., Davidson S., Estrin D., Franklin M., Martonosi M., Raghavan P., Stodden V., Szalay A.S., Realizing the Potential of Data Science, Commun.

The lectures on these topics cannot stand alone without coding practice on real-world data sets. Some instructors prefer to utilize small data sets for practice in classroom or assignments, which limits experimental experiences and may even bring misleading experiences to students. Others may try to assign large data sets to students, but students may not be able to bear with the running time due to the efficiency issue raised by several factors (e.g., data size, algorithm complexity, computing power, etc.). In this paper, we first learned students' preferences on the scalability of data sets for practice in data science courses, and performed experimental analysis by running different data science algorithms over both student laptops and personal/office computers, in order to deliver a suggestion about the appropriate data size for practice in multiple scenarios (e.g., in-class practice, assignments, class projects, research projects, etc.). We believe that our findings are valuable to help instructors prepare and assign real-world data sets to students in data science curriculum.  © 2022 Owner/Author.","data science; data size; experimental analysis; information technology education; running efficiency; scalability","Big data; Computational complexity; Curricula; Data Analytics; Data mining; Data Science; Efficiency; Scalability; Data analytics; Data set; Data size; Experimental analysis; Information technology education; Mining machines; Pressure tests; Real-world; Running efficiency; Science education; Students","","","","","","","Arthur D., Vassilvitskii S., k-means++: The advantages of careful seeding, Technical Report., (2006); Singh Bhathal G., Singh A., Big data computing with distributed computing frameworks, Innovations in Electronics and Communication Engineering, pp. 467-477, (2019); Breiman L., Random forests, Machine learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Brunner R.J., Kim E.J., Teaching data science, Procedia Computer Science, 80, pp. 1947-1956, (2016); Cen L., Ruta D., Ng J., Big education: Opportunities for big data analytics, 2015 IEEE international conference on digital signal processing (DSP).

Yet, less is known about the pedagogical practices and tools employed in data science education. Through a systematic literature review, we summarize prior pedagogical practices and tools used in data science initiatives at the higher education level. Following the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, we aim to characterize the technological and pedagogical knowledge quality of reviewed studies, as we find the content presented to be diverse and incomparable. TPACK is a universally established method for teaching considering information and communication technology. Yet it is seldom used for the analysis of data science pedagogy. To make this framework more structured, we list the tools employed in each reviewed study to summarize technological knowledge quality. We further examine whether each study follows the needs of the Cognitive Apprenticeship theory to summarize the pedagogical knowledge quality in each reviewed study. Of the 23 reviewed studies, 14 met the needs of Cognitive Apprenticeship theory and include hands-on experiences, promote students’ active learning, seeking guidance from the instructor as a coach, introduce students to the real-world industry demands of data and data scientists, and provide meaningful learning resources and feedback across various stages of their data science initiatives. While each study presents at least one tool to teach data science, we found the assessment of the technological knowledge of data science initiatives to be difficult. This is because the studies fall short of explaining how students come to learn the operation of tools and become proficient in using them throughout a course or program. Our review aims to highlight implications for practices and tools used in data science pedagogy for future research. © Crown 2023.","Artificial intelligence; Data analytics; Education; Higher education","","","","","","Canada Research Chairs","This study was funded by Canada Research Chair Program and Canada Foundation for Innovation ","Akram H., Yingxiu Y., Al-Adwan A.S., Alkhalifah A., Technology integration in higher education during COVID-19: An assessment of online teaching competencies through technological pedagogical content knowledge model, Frontiers in Psychology, 12, (2021); Aktas I., Ozmen H., Investigating the impact of TPACK development course on pre-service science teachers’ performances, Asia Pacific Education Review, 21, pp. 667-682, (2020); Allaire J.J., Xie Y., McPherson J., Luraschi J., Ushey K., Atkins A., Wickham H., Cheng J., Chang W., Iannone R., Rmarkdown: Dynamic Documents for R, (2021); Allen G.I., Experiential learning in data science: Developing an interdisciplinary, client-sponsored capstone program, SIGCSE - Proc.

This includes the production of the school as an institution. A critical approach to education therefore must reinscribe students with the ability to see what educational processes attempt to hide and to construct an understanding of the real for themselves. To illustrate this argument, we explore the production of visuality within data science education as one example of how the visual manifests within schools. In response, we propose a visual literacy informed approach to engaging students with data, one that expands beyond contemporary forms of critical data literacy by involving an ontological critique of educational aestheticization. To ground this work, we examine the role of visuality and aesthetics within the implementation of co-designed arts-infused data science projects in four US middle schools. In analyzing interviews with teachers and students, we uncover a series of tensions that reveal the ongoing influence of school visualities alongside the potential for student generated images to amplify their right to look. We therefore argue that critical pedagogies must not only involve reading and critiquing aesthetic artifacts but also engage students in a critique of visuality itself. © 2024 The Author(s).

Training in quantitative methods and reasoning is critical for graduate students in biomedical and science programs to foster reproducible and responsible research practices. We argue that graduate student education should more center around fundamental reasoning and integration skills rather than mainly on listing 1 statistical test method after the other without conveying the bigger context picture or critical argumentation skills that will enable student to Pleasechecktheeditsmadetothetitleandprovidecorrectwordingifnecessary improve research integrity through rigorous practice.:Herein, we describe the approach we take in a quantitative reasoning course in the R3 program at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with an error-focused lens, based on visualization and communication competencies. Specifically, we take this perspective stemming from the discussed causes of irreproducibility and apply it specifically to the many aspects of good statistical practice in science, ranging from experimental design to data collection and analysis, and conclusions drawn from the data. We also provide tips and guidelines for the implementation and adaptation of our course material to various graduate biomedical and STEM science programs. © 2023 Ciubotariu, Bosch.

However, there are two issues with this approach: (1) it is very costly to prepare multiple real-world problems (using real data) according to the learning objectives, and (2) the learner must suddenly tackle complex real-world problems immediately after learning from a textbook using ideal data. To solve these issues, this paper proposes data science teaching material that uses agent-based simulation (ABS). The proposed teaching material consists of an ABS model and an ABS story. To solve issue 1, the scenario of the problem can be changed according to the learning objectives by setting the appropriate parameters of the ABS model. To solve issue 2, the difficulty level of the tasks can be adjusted by changing the description in the ABS story. We show that, by using this teaching material, the learner can simulate the typical tasks performed by a data scientist in a step-by-step manner (causal inference, data understanding, hypothesis building, data collection, data wrangling, data analysis, and hypothesis testing). The teaching material described in this paper focuses on causal inference as the learning objectives and infectious diseases as the model theme for ABS, but ABS is used as a model to reproduce many types of social phenomena, and its range of expression is extremely wide. Therefore, we expect that the proposed teaching material will inspire the construction of teaching material for various objectives in data science education.  © 2023 IEEE.","agent-based simulation; causal inference; COVID-19; data science education","Data acquisition; Data Science; Learning systems; Agent based simulation; Agent-based simulation models; Causal inferences; Data science education; Data understanding; Learning objectives; Real-world problem; Science education; Science teaching; Teaching materials; COVID-19","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (22K13785)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Edanz (https://jp.edanz.com/ac) for editing a draft of this manuscript.

Data feminism is an approach that draws on feminist scholarship and action to humanize data and contend with the relationships between data and power. In this review paper, we draw on principles from data feminism to review 42 different educational research and design approaches that engage youth with data, many of which are educational technology intensive and bear on future data-intensive educational technology research and design projects. We describe how the projects engage students with examining power, challenging power, elevating emotion and lived experience, rethinking binaries and hierarchies, embracing pluralism, considering context, and making labour visible. In doing so, we articulate ways that current data education initiatives involve youth in thinking about issues of justice and inclusion. These projects may offer examples of varying complexity for future work to contend with and, ideally, extend in order to further realize data feminism in K-12 data science education. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Data feminism is an emergent framework for changing data practices and discourse in service of equity and justice. Data science education is rapidly growing as a topic of interest in the educational technology research and design communities. Many educational technology and design projects have been launched and shared in publications that preceded the widespread distribution of the data feminism framework. What this paper adds Data feminism is partially re-articulated in terms familiar to educational technology research communities. Prior and recent projects are organized with respect to how they illustrate potential connections to core data feminism principles. This paper identifies specific strategies that recent projects have used that have potential for realizing data feminism principles. Implications for practice and/or policy Educational technologists can use the re-articulated principles of data feminism for education to inform their future design work. Tractable steps to achieve data justice that are attainable within existing educational systems can be pursued. Communities can and should bring together multiple ways of knowing to support new educational practices and futures with data. © 2022 The Authors.

Further, the increased availability of large-scale electronically accessible data sets is an untapped area of study. This interpretive study examined middle school students' understanding of statistical concepts involved in making a plan to collect data to answer a statistical question within a social issue context using data available on the internet. Student artifacts, researcher notes, and audio and video recordings from nine groups of 20 seventh-grade students in two gifted education pull-out classes at a suburban middle school were used to answer the study research questions. Data were analyzed using a priori codes from previously developed frameworks and by using an inductive approach to find themes. Three themes that emerged from data related to confirmation bias. Some middle school students held preconceptions about the social issues they chose to study that biased their statistical questions. This in turn inuenced the sources of data students used to answer their questions. Confirmation bias is a serious issue that is exacerbated due to endless sources of data electronically available. We argue that this type of bias should be addressed early in students' educational experiences. Based on the findings from this study, we other recommendations for future research and implications for statistics and data science education. © American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

Background There has been an increase in the number of data science programs especially because of the increased appreciation of data as a multidisciplinary strategic resource. This has resulted in a greater need for skills in data science to extract meaningful insights from data. However, the data science programs are not enough to meet the demand for data science skills. While there is growth in data science programs, they appear more as a rebranding of existing engineering, computer science, mathematics, and statistics programs. Methodology A scoping review was adopted for the period 2010–2021 using six scholarly multidisciplinary databases: Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and the AIS Basket of eight journals. The study was narrowed down to 91 research articles and adopted a classification coding framework and correlation analysis for analysis. Contribution We theoretically contribute to the growing body of knowledge about the need to scale up data science through multidisciplinary pedagogies and disciplines as the demand grows. This paves the way for future research to understand which programs can provide current and future data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs. Findings The key results revealed the limited emphasis on DSE, especially in non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines. In addition, the results identified the need to find a suitable pedagogy or a set of pedagogies because of the multidisciplinary nature of DSE. Further, there is currently no existing framework to guide the design and development of DSE at various education levels, leading to sometimes inadequate programs. The study also noted the importance of various stakeholders who can contribute towards DSE and thus create opportunities in the DSE ecosystem. Most of the research studies reviewed were case studies that presented more STEM programs as compared to non-STEM. Recommendations for Practitioners We recommend CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) as a framework to adopt collaborative pedagogies to teach data science. This research implies that it is important for academia, policymakers, and data science content developers to work closely with organizations to understand their needs. Recommendations for Researchers We recommend future research into programs that can provide current and future data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs and how interdisciplinarity within these programs can be integrated. Impact on Society Data science expertise is essential for tackling societal issues and generating beneficial effects. The main problem is that data is diverse and always changing, necessitating ongoing (up)skilling. Academic institutions must therefore stay current with new advances, changing data, and organizational requirements. Industry experts might share views based on their practical knowledge. The DSE ecosystem can be shaped by collaborating with numerous stakeholders and being aware of each stakeholder’s function in order to advance data science internationally. Future Research The study found that there are a number of research opportunities that can be explored to improve the implementation of DSE, for instance, how can CRISP-DM be integrated into collaborative pedagogies to provide a fully comprehensive data science curriculum? © (CC BY-NC 4.0) This article is licensed to you under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.","data science applications in education; data science education; pedagogy; teaching/learning strategies; transdisciplinary projects","","","","","","European Commission, EC; Deutsche Telekom Stiftung","First, public institutions benefit from the teaching and learning funding model to support DSE through sourcing qualified lecturers and conducting research related to data science and DSE.

Drawing on the analysis of artifacts and videos collected during a three-day workshop, we explore the types of visualizations created by participants and the process they engaged with to produce visualizations. Although the representational forms chosen by students were mainly traditional, our findings indicate that they were engaged in authentic data visualization practices throughout their programming process. These practices included translating ideas into programs, selecting parameters (such as color scheme and space between data points), inspecting the output, and adding annotations to provide context and better communicate the desired information. Moreover, our analysis pointed out opportunities for improving PlayData, mainly by the addition of new primitives for automating labeling and performing data transformations. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, it remains uncertain whether the data science programs provided by universities with different rankings deliver similar or distinct data science competencies. This study aims to compare the competencies of graduate data science programs offered in the United States. It addressed the research question of 'Are there any differences in graduate data science program competencies based on their university rankings?' The program competencies of 228 data science graduate programs as well as their U.S. News university rankings were collected and compared. The findings indicate that regardless of their national rankings, all universities offer most of the competencies required for data science programs, except for Machine Learning and Sensor Networks. Forty-six percent of data science programs are offered in universities that hold national rankings within the top 75, focusing on majors such as data science and business analytics. Furthermore, the top-ranked universities provide data science programs across all departments or schools, with the most prominent ones being Business, Computer Science, Information Science & Technology, and Math/Statistics. The primary research contribution of this study revolves around conducting a comprehensive analysis of data science program competencies within the United States. The implications of the findings have significant relevance to computing education. The study provides valuable guidelines for educational practices in the field of data science: 1) naming the new majors as either 'Data Science' or 'Business Analytics'; 2) housing the new data science programs within existing departments or schools specializing in Business, Computer Science, Information Science & Technology, and Math/Statistics; 3) incorporating all ACM Data Science competencies into the curriculum of these programs while also emphasizing the need for a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics. Overall, these implications provide valuable guidance for universities seeking to develop impactful and well-rounded data science educational offerings that align with industry demands and equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge. © 2023 IEEE.","ACM Competencies; Computer Science; Computing Education; Data Science Competence; Data Science Education; Graduate Education","Education computing; Engineering education; Students; ACM competency; Business analytics; Computing education; Data science competence; Data science education; Graduate education; Graduate programme; Science education; Science projects; Science technologies; Sensor networks","","","","","","","Paul P., Aithal P.S., Computing Academics into New AgePrograms and Fields: Big Data Analytics & Data Sciences in IndianAcademics-An Academic Investigation, IRA-International Journalof Management & Social Sciences, 10, pp. 107-118, (2018); Zhang Y., Wu D., Hagen L., Song I.Y., Mostafa J., Oh S., Anderson T., Data Science curriculum in the iField, Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, (2022); Song I.Y., Zhu Y., Big data and data science: opportunities andchallenges of iSchools, Journal of Data and Information Science, 2, pp. 1-18, (2016); White J.A., Gaver D.P., Butera R.J., Et al., Core Competencies forUndergraduates in Bioengineering and Biomedical Engineering: Findings, Consequences, and Recommendations, Ann Biomed Engvol., 48, pp. 905-912, (2020); Bukhari D., Data Science Curriculum: Current Scenario, International Journal of Data Mining & Knowledge ManagementProcess (IJDKP), 10, (2020); Li D., Milonas E., Zhang Q., Content Analysis of Data Science Graduate Programs in the US, 2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access, (2021); Overton M., Keleinschmit S., Data science literacy: Toward aphilosophy of accessible and adaptable data science skill developmentin public administration programs, Teaching Public Administration, 40, 3, pp. 354-365, (2022); Demchenko Y., Belloum A., Los W., Wiktorski T., Manieri A., Brocks H., Becker J., Heutelbeck D., Hemmje M., Brewer S., EDISON Data Science Framework: A Foundation for Building Data Science Profession for Research and Industry, pp. 620-626, (2016); Leidig P., Cassel L., ACM Taskforce Efforts on ComputingCompetencies in Undergraduate Data Science Curricula, Proceedings of the 2020 ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, (2020); De Veaux R., Agarwal M., Averett M., Baumer B., Bray A., Bressoud T., Bryant L., Cheng L., Francis A., Gould R., Kim A., Kretchmar M., Lu Q., Moskol A., Nolan D., Pelayo R., Raleigh S., Sethi R., Sondjaja M., Tiruviluamala N., Uhlig P., Washington T., Wesley C., White D., Ye P., Curriculum Guidelines forUndergraduate Programs in Data Science, The Annual Review ofStatistics and Its Application, (2017)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE)/Educational Research and Methods Divison (ERM); IEEE; IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Education Society","53rd IEEE ASEE Frontiers in Education International Conference, FIE 2023","18 October 2023 through 21 October 2023","College Station","196211","15394565","979-835033642-9","PFECD","","English","Proc.

Along with the development of curricula to teach data science, the number and diversity of tools for introducing data science to learners are also multiplying. The tools used to teach data science play a central role in shaping the learning experience. Therefore, it is important to carefully choose which tools to use to introduce learners to data science. This article presents a systematic analysis of 30 data science tools that are, or designed to be, used in introductory data science education for K-12 students. The identified tools list includes spreadsheets, visual analysis tools, and scripting environments. For each tool, we examine facets of its capabilities, interactions, educational support, and accessibility. For block-based programming tools, we also examine the data science functionalities available in that tool’s blocks. This paper advances our understanding of the current state of introductory data science environments and highlights opportunities for creating new tools to better prepare learners to navigate the data-rich world surrounding them. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","block-based programming; Data science; K-12 education","Students; Analysis tools; Block based; Block-based programming; K-12 education; Learning experiences; Science education; Science tools; Scripting environment; Systematic analysis; Visual analysis; article; controlled study; data science; education; nonhuman; pharmacology; student; Data Science","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2141655)","This research is supported by the National Science Foundation (award #2141655).

Our study examined policies and professional autonomy with a focus on dilemmas encountered in everyday work by data managers. We found that dilemmas arose at every stage of the research data lifecycle, and legacy data presents particularly vexing challenges. The iFields' emphasis on knowledge organization and representation provides insight into how data, used by scientists, are used to create knowledge. The iFields' disciplinary emphasis also encompasses the sociotechnical complexity of dilemmas that we found arise in research data management. Therefore, we posit that iSchools are positioned to contribute to data science education by teaching about ethics and infrastructure used to collect, organize, and disseminate data through problem-based learning. © 2022 The Authors.

Effective data science education requires a comprehensive approach that incorporates theoretical knowledge, practical skills, and industry relevance. However, it is difficult to find appropriate teaching strategies and tools that successfully integrate all these elements into the classroom. Consequently, there is a need to identify and develop effective pedagogical methods, instructional resources, and technological solutions that enable instructors to deliver well-rounded data science education that caters to the diverse needs of students and prepares them for real-world data-driven challenges. Knowing which technology is appropriate to use in conjunction with a particular teaching pedagogy to deliver a particular piece of learning material to diverse students is crucial. Therefore, this study aimed to explore how the TPACK (technological pedagogical content knowledge) influences data science teaching practices. To achieve this, the study surveyed 26 data science instructors to assess their confidence in the seven TPACK constructs. The findings of the study showed a low representation of women in data science education. The findings also showed a balanced knowledge between pedagogy and technological content, indicating that instructors can contribute to a comprehensive and engaging learning environment that supports student success in data science education. Despite this positive finding being established, it was not clear which technological teaching and learning tools instructors are familiar with. To this end, future studies are recommended in this area. The results further showed that model evaluation is not taught at undergraduate level. Therefore, the study recommends continuous professional development for data science instructors to effectively contribute towards training current and future data scientists. This is necessary since technologies, data, and data science tools and techniques evolve. Furthermore, the study recommends research be conducted on the type of data science framework required to guide instructors in terms of curriculum design, pedagogies, and technological tools. Research that informs policy is also necessary to support efforts directed at data literacy, especially to support personnel involved in human capacity development in data science. Lastly, within the scope of data science, interdisciplinary collaboration at national and international levels is recommended so that instructors can stay updated with advancements in subject matter, technology, and pedagogy. © 2023 The Authors","Data science; Education; Educational technology; Teaching; Technological pedagogical content knowledge","","","","","","","","Ambusaidi A.K., Al-Maqbali F.Y., Exploring pedagogical decision making from the lens of science teachers in response to different pedagogical issues, Social Sciences & Humanities Open, 5, 1, (2022); Anderson P.E., Turner C., Dierksheide J., McCauley R., An extensible online environment for teaching data science concepts through gamification, Proceedings - frontiers in education conference, FIE, (2015); Asamoah D.A., Doran D., Schiller S., Interdisciplinarity in data science pedagogy: A foundational design, Journal of Computer Information Systems, 60, 4, pp. 370-377, (2020); Basaran B., Investigating science and mathematics teacher candidate's perceptions of TPACK-21 based on 21st century skills, Elementary Education Online, 19, 4, pp. 2212-2226, (2020); Beckman M.D., Cetinkaya-Rundel M., Horton N.J., Rundel C.W., Sullivan A.J., Tackett M., Implementing version control with git and GitHub as a learning objective in statistics and data science courses, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 29, 1, pp. 132-144, (2021); Investing in America's data science and analytics talent (Issue April), (2017); Blake A., Dynamics of data science skills: How can all sectors benefit from data science talent?, (2019); Chang C.-L., McAleer M., Wong W.-K., Big data, computational science, economics, finance, marketing, management, and psychology : Connections, Journal of Risk and Financial Management Review, 11, 15, (2018); Daniel B.K., Big data and data science: A critical review of issues for educational research, British Journal of Educational Technology, 50, 1, pp. 101-113, (2019); Davenport T., Malone K., Deployment as a critical business data science discipline, Harvard Data Science Review, 3, 1, (2021); Dill-McFarland K.A., Konig S.G., Mazel F., Oliver D.C., McEwen L.M., Hong K.Y., Hallam S.J., An integrated, modular approach to data science education in microbiology, PLoS Computational Biology, 17, 2, (2021); Donoghue T., Voytek B., Ellis S.E., Teaching creative and practical data science at scale, Taylor & Francis, 29, S1, pp. 27-39, (2021); Doukakis S., Papalaskari M.A., Scaffolding technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) in computer science education through learning activity creation. 2019 4th South-East Europe design automation, computer engineering, computer Networks and social media conference, (2019); Doukakis S., Psaltidou A., Stavraki A., Adamopoulos N., Tsiotakis P., Stergou S., Measuring the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) of in-service teachers of computer science who teach algorithms and programming in upper secondary education, (2021); Dubey R., Gunasekaran A., Education and training for successful career in big data and business analytics, Industrial & Commercial Training, 47, 4, pp. 174-181, (2015); van Dusen E., Suen A., Liang A., Bhatnagar A., Accelerating the advancement of data science education, Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 56, 1, pp. 601-603, (2019); Elas N.I.B., Majid F.B.A., Narasuman S.A., Development of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) for English teachers: The validity and reliability, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning, 14, 20, pp. 18-33, (2019); Ertmer P.A., Ottenbreit-Leftwich A., Removing obstacles to the pedagogical changes required by Jonassen's vision of authentic technology-enabled learning, Computers in Education, 64, pp. 175-182, (2013); Ertmer P.A., Ottenbreit-Leftwich A.T., Sadik O., Sendurur E., Sendurur P., Teacher beliefs and technology integration practices: A critical relationship, Computers in Education, 59, 2, pp. 423-435, (2012); Garcia-Algarra J., Introductory machine learning for non STEM students, (2020); Garmire L.X., Gliske S., Nguyen Q.C., Chen J.H., Nemati S., Van Horn J.D., Moore J.H., Shreffler C., Dunn M., The training of next generation data scientists in biomedicine.

In this paper, we discuss the centrality of API (application programming interface) lookup to data wran-gling, and how an ontology-structured command menu could facilitate it. We design thumbnail graphics as visual alternatives to explaining data wrangling operations and use a survey to validate their quality. We furthermore predict that thumbnail graphics make the menu more navigable, improving lookup e_ciency and performance. Our predictions are tested using Slice N Dice, an online data wrangling tutorial platform that collects learner activity. It includes both non-programmatic and programmatic data wrangling exercises. Participants from a multi-institutional sample (n=200) were randomly assigned the tutorial either with or without thumbnail graphics. Our results show that thumbnail graphics reduce the need for clari_cations, thereby assisting API lookup for novices learning data wrangling. We further present some negative results regarding performance gain and follow up with a discussion on why the di_erences are subtle and how they can be improved. Last but not least, we complement our statistical results with a qualitative study where we receive positive feedback from our participants on the design and helpfulness of the thumbnail graphics. © American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

As a consequence, the spectrum of data science education programs has increased significantly in recent years, and there is a high demand for data scientists at many companies. However, what training is required to become a data scientist? What is the role of data scientists in current enterprises? Is the training well-aligned to the practical needs of a job? In this article, we will address these questions by evaluating a survey of people who were trained in a continuing education program in data science in Switzerland. Our study sheds lights on the practical aspects of the data science education and how this newly-gained knowledge can successfully be applied in an enterprise. One of the highlights from the point of view of the database community is the important role of SQL in data science. © 2023 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","data science; data science education; data science methods","'current; Continuing education; Data science education; Data science method; Education programmes; High demand; Science education; Science methods; Spectra's; Switzerland; Data Science","","","","","","","Baskarada S., Koronios A., Unicorn data scientist: the rarest of breeds, Program: electronic library and information systems, 51, 1, (2017); Braschler M., Stadelmann T., Stockinger K., Applied Data Science, (2019); Davenport T.H., Patil D., Data scientist: The sexiest job of the 21st century, Harvard business review, 90, 5, pp. 70-76, (2012); Klee S., Janson A., Leimeister J.M., How data analytics competencies can foster business value-a systematic review and way forward, Information Systems Management, 38, 3, pp. 200-217, (2021); Kozyrkov C., Why an ai researcher shouldn't be your first data science hire, (2022); Mikalef P., Giannakos M.N., Pappas I.O., Krogstie J., The human side of big data: Understanding the skills of the data scientist in education and industry, 2018 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), pp. 503-512, (2018); Mikalef P., Krogstie J., Investigating the data science skill gap: An empirical analysis, 2019 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), pp. 1275-1284, (2019); Rzeznikiewicz D., How to become a data scientist: A guide to the education, skills, and necessary experience, (2022); Stockinger K., Stadelmann T., Ruckstuhl A., Data Scientist als Beruf, Big Data: Grundlagen, Systeme und Nutzungspotenziale, chapter 4, pp. 59-81, (2016)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","","","01635808","","SRECD","","English","SIGMOD Rec.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168795466"

This paper focuses on the role of data science and analytics education to improve the students' computing and analytical skills across a range of domain-specific problems. The paper studies four examples of data-intensive STEM projects for supervised undergraduate research experiences (SURE) in Mechanical Engineering, Biomedical science, Quantum Physics, and Cybersecurity. The developed projects include the applications of data science for improving additive manufacturing, automating microscopy images analysis, identifying the quantum optical modes, and detecting network intrusion. The paper aims to provide some guidelines to effectively educate the next generation of STEM undergraduate and graduate students and prepare STEM professionals with interdisciplinary knowledge, skills, and competencies in data science. The paper includes a summary of activities and outcomes from our research and education in the field of data science and machine learning.

Over three academic terms, the author mandated these tools across courses in R, Python, C++, SQL, and more. The onboarding relied on simplified Emacs tutorials and starter configurations. Students gained proficiency after undertaking initial practice. Live coding sessions demonstrated the flexible instruction enabled by literate notebooks. Assignments and projects required documentation alongside functional code. Student feedback showed enthusiasm for learning a versatile IDE, despite some frustration with the learning curve. Skilled students highlighted efficiency gains in a unified environment. However, the uneven adoption of documentation practices pointed to a need for better incorporation into grading. Additionally, some students found Emacs unintuitive, desiring more accessible options. This highlights a need to match tools to skill levels, potentially starting novices with graphical IDEs before introducing Emacs. The key takeaways are as follows: literate programming aids comprehension but requires rigorous onboarding and reinforcement, and Emacs excels for advanced workflows but has a steep initial curve. With proper support, these tools show promise for data science education. © 2023 by the author.","case study; data science; Emacs; IDE; literate programming; org-mode; teaching","","","","","","","","Stallman R., Steele G., GNU Emacs Manual, (2022); Knuth D., Literate programming, Comput.

For youth growing up in an increasingly data-driven society, it is critical they have foundational data literacy skills. A central component of data literacy is the ability to collect, analyze, visualize, and make meaning from data. All of these activities are mediated and shaped by the tools that youth use to carry out these data practices. Given the essential role tools play in enabling and supporting youth in engaging with and interpreting data, understanding what tools are used and how they are used in educational contexts will help us understand how youth are being prepared to be data-literate citizens. In this paper, we present the analysis of the data collection and analysis tools used in 4 widely adopted high school data science curricula. The analysis attends to both what tools are used as well as what datasets they are used to analyze. This work contributes to our understanding of the way youth are being introduced to concepts and practices from the field of data science and the role the tools play in shaping those experiences. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","data analysis tools; data science education; youth","Central component; Data analysis tool; Data collection tools; Data driven; Data practices; Data science education; Data understanding; Educational context; Science education; Youth; Data Science","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2141655)","This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant #2141655.

Given that DS is highly interdisciplinary and individual institutions have various academic structures, creating a new DS program needs to consider many factors. This poster details the process of how to create an undergraduate DS minor program with considerations of the following key questions: (1) What is the general background of DS education landscape and iSchools? (2) What is the institutional context of DS education, i.e., what are gaps in the institutional DS education? How does the proposed program fit in and distinguish itself from other DS programs on campus? (3) How to navigate the DS approval process with multiple DS programs on campus? This work will help those who plan to create and revise a DS program that benefits students and fits in the broad DS education landscape and their own institution.

AI) paradigm that aims at broadening participation in data science education and enhancing undergraduate students’ data literacy. The core of the paradigm is the “Tell Stories” approach. This approach applies the 5W+1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How) conceptual schema of stories as a transdisciplinary language for data science education for STEM and non-STEM majors. Accordingly, this study reported findings from the OCEL.AI project that implemented and evaluated the paradigm. A field experiment, in addition to classroom observations, was conducted to compare the learning outcomes of students in data science competence, appreciation, career motivation, life-long willingness to learn, and self-efficacy in data science between the treatment group and the control group. The results showed that the OCEL.AI paradigm improved undergraduates’ data science competence and career motivation despite majors or gender. © 2023","Cooperative/collaborative learning; Data science applications in education; Improving classroom teaching; Interdisciplinary projects; Teaching/learning strategies","","","","","","OCEL.AI; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1935076); National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding text 1: This study is supported and funded by the National Science Foundation CUE Ethics: Open Collaborative Experiential Learning (OCEL.AI).

Data science is one of the six scientific gaps that emerged in the global experience with the COVID-19 pandemic. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) can potentially address the critical need to build public health data science capabilities and competencies in outbreak and pandemic management. The objective of the study was to perform a scoping review with thematic analysis and identify the key themes across MOOCs covering content on outbreak and pandemic management using qualitative evidence synthesis. A total of 458 unique records were found, of which 69 were relevant to the pandemic and outbreak management context. Thematic analysis identified three cross-cutting themes: (i) personal and professional competencies, (ii) institutional and organisational response, and (iii) community participation—the growing role of MOOCs in building competencies that are empowering and enabling to individuals and communities. A limited number of courses covered the use of data science in outbreak and pandemic management suggesting the need for future MOOCs to integrate data science knowledge and methods in public health education and training. Data science competencies are central to strengthening the health system and effective public health response. MOOCs present a promising opportunity to deliver public health data science education, integrating domain expertise, public health ethics, and data science methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Massive open online courses (MOOCs); Outbreak management; Pandemic management; Public health data science; Public health education","Data Science; E-learning; Information management; Health data; Health education; Health systems; Massive open online course; Outbreak management; Pandemic management; Public health data science; Public health education; Science education; Public health","","","","","","","Iniesto F., McAndrew P., Minocha S., Coughlan T., Accessibility of MOOCs: Understanding the provider perspective, J Interact Media Educ, 2016, 1, (2016); Zhang Q., Gao J., Wu J.T., Cao Z., Zeng D.D., Data science approaches to confronting the COVID-19 pandemic: A narrative review, Philos Trans R Soc A, 380, 2214, (2022); Aldridge RW (2019) Research and training recommendations for public health data science, Lancet Public Health, 4, 8; Hunter D.J., Lapp I., Frenk J., Education in public health: Expanding the frontiers, Am J Prev Med, 47, 5, pp. S286-S287, (2014); Gooding I., Klaas B., Yager J.D., Kanchanaraksa S., Massive open online courses in public health, Front Public Health, 1, (2013); Bhattacharya S., Singh A., Hossain M.M., Health system strengthening through Massive open online courses (MOOCs) during the COVID-19 pandemic: An analysis from the available evidence, J Educ Health Promot, 9, (2020); Bendezu-Quispe G., Torres-Roman J.S., Salinas-Ochoa B., Hernandez-Vasquez A., Utility of massive open online courses (MOOCs) concerning outbreaks of emerging and reemerging diseases, F1000research, 6, (2017); Multisectoral and intersectoral action for improved health and well-being for all: Mapping of the WHO European region.

In this exploratory study, we aimed to understand (a) what apt epistemic processes within data literacy look like in practice with children, and (b) to what extent a curriculum built on a simulation-based data analysis intervention (where students engage in experimentation and data analyses through the use of simulations) promotes the epistemic processes of data literacy. We used the Apt-AIR framework, which expounds on the components needed for successful epistemic education, as a tool to identify students’ apt epistemic processes. The results illustrate that elementary students were able to activate cognitive, emotional, and—to a lesser extent—metacognitive and collaborative epistemic processes related to data literacy skills in this context. Additionally, the design features embedded in the experimentation lesson were more successful in engaging students in apt epistemic processes; yet the data analysis lesson, while engaging students in fewer processes overall, was successful in promoting students’ ability to make accurate inferences using an aggregate view of data. We discuss the trends in the apt epistemic processes related to data literacy that emerged and their implications for instruction and learning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Apt-AIR Framework; Data Science Education; Informal Statistical Inference; Simulations","","","","","","Litzsinger Road Ecology Foundation; NSF-DRL; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1513043); National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding text 1: This research was largely funded by the National Science Foundation, grant number 1513043, and, in part, by the Litzsinger Road Ecology Foundation.

While there is widespread agreement on the importance of teaching ethics within computing contexts, there is no clear method for its implementation and assessment. Studies focusing on methods for integrating ethics into data science courses reveal that students tend to neglect ethical concerns in their data analysis. Based on the data we collected from questionnaires distributed to undergraduate science and engineering students, this paper expands the discussion beyond human concerns and ethics in data science education. As we will show, students tend to neglect the context when attempting to solve data science questions. We argue that gaps in understanding the context relating to the data result in gaps in the analysis as well as in the interpretation of the data. Thus, we propose anthropological thinking as a pedagogy to overcome the context neglect. Placing the spotlight on the context promotes a holistic understanding of the phenomenon being analyzed, as it includes important considerations that do not necessarily fit the more commonly used term human concerns. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Anthropology; Application domain; Context; Data science education; Data thinking","","","","","","","","Code 2018 - ACM Ethics, (2018); Banks M., Visual methods in social research, (2001); Identifying versus identifying with the other: Reflections on the siting of the subject in anthropological discourse, After Writing Culture: Epistemology and Praxis in Contemporary Anthropology (Pp., pp. 34-50, (1997); The shortest path to ethics in AI: An integrated assignment where human concerns guide technical decisions, Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research - Volume 1 (ICER ‘22), pp. 344-355, (2022); Introduction: Anthropology and the redicaments of holism, In T.

The tools used to teach data science play a central role in shaping the learning experience. Therefore, it is important to carefully choose which tools to use to introduce learners to data science. This article presents a systematic review of 25 data science tools that are, or can be, used in introductory data science education for K-12 students. The identified tools list includes spreadsheets, visual analysis tools, and scripting environments. For each tool, we examine facets of its capabilities, interactions, educational support, and accessibility.

Feature selection, enabled by RF, is often among the very first tasks in a data science project, such as the college capstone project, industry consulting projects. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of 12 RF-based feature selection methods for classification problems. The review provides necessary description of each method and the software packages. We show that different methods typically do not provide consistent feature selection results, and the model performance also varies when different RF-based feature selection approaches are employed. This observation suggests that caution must be taken when performing feature selection tasks using RF. Feature selection cannot be blindly done without a sound understanding of the methods adopted, which is not always the case in industry and many senior capstone projects that we have observed. The paper serves as a one-stop reference where students, data science consultants, engineers, and data scientists can access the basic ideas behind these methods, the advantages and limitations of different approaches, as well as the software packages to implement these methods. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Capstone projects; Classification; Data science consulting projects; Data science education; Feature importance; Feature selection; Random forest","Data Science; Education computing; Feature Selection; Learning systems; Software packages; Capstone projects; Consulting projects; Data science consulting project; Data science education; Feature importance; Feature selection methods; Features selection; Random forests; Science applications; Science education; Classification (of information)","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (OIA-1946391); National Science Foundation, NSF","This material was partially supported by the National Science Foundation under Award No. OIA-1946391.

Training healthcare specialists who are knowledgeable in both health and data sciences is highly required, important, and challenging. Therefore, it is essential to analyse students’ learning experiences through artificial intelligence techniques in order to provide both teachers and learners with insights about effective learning strategies and to improve existing HDS course designs. Methods: We applied artificial intelligence methods to uncover learning tactics and strategies employed by students in an HDS massive open online course with over 3,000 students enrolled. We also used statistical tests to explore students’ engagement with different resources (such as reading materials and lecture videos) and their level of engagement with various HDS topics. Results: We found that students in HDS employed four learning tactics, such as actively connecting new information to their prior knowledge, taking assessments and practising programming to evaluate their understanding, collaborating with their classmates, and repeating information to memorise. Based on the employed tactics, we also found three types of learning strategies, including low engagement (Surface learners), moderate engagement (Strategic learners), and high engagement (Deep learners), which are in line with well-known educational theories. The results indicate that successful students allocate more time to practical topics, such as projects and discussions, make connections among concepts, and employ peer learning. Conclusions: We applied artificial intelligence techniques to provide new insights into HDS education. Based on the findings, we provide pedagogical suggestions not only for course designers but also for teachers and learners that have the potential to improve the learning experience of HDS students. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence; Educational data mining; Health data science; Health informatics; Learning analytics; Learning engagement; Learning strategy; Learning tactic; Medical education","Artificial Intelligence; Curriculum; Data Science; Humans; Learning; adult; article; artificial intelligence; clinician; data mining; educational theory; health data; human; learning; medical education; medical informatics; science education; student engagement; teacher; videorecording; curriculum; data science; education; learning","","","","","University of Edinburgh, ED; Medical Research Council, MRC, (MR/N013166/1)","Funding text 1: We would like to thank the Precision Medicine programme of the University of Edinburgh, as well as the Medical Research Council, for their support of this project aimed at enhancing health data science education.

At the same time, philosophers of science face the challenge of making their expertise accessible for scientists in such a way that it can improve everyday research practice. Here, we investigate the possibility of approaching these challenges together. In current and proposed approaches to biomedical data science education, we identify a dominant focus on only one aspect of conducting scientific research: understanding and using data, research methods, and statistical methods. We argue that this approach cannot solve biomedical data science’s challenge and we propose to shift the focus to four other aspects of conducting research: making and justifying decisions in research design and implementation, explaining their epistemic and non-epistemic effects, balancing varying responsibilities, and reporting scientific research. Attending to these aspects requires learning on different dimensions than solely learning to apply techniques (first dimension). It also requires learning to make choices (second dimension) and to understand the rationale behind choices (third dimension). This could be fostered by integrating philosophical training in biomedical data science education. Furthermore, philosophical training fosters a fourth dimension of learning, namely, understanding the nature of science. In this article, we explain how we identified the five aspects of conducting research and the four dimensions of learning, and why attending to the fourth dimension is essential. We discuss educational approaches to attend to all aspects and dimensions, and present initial design principles to implement these approaches. © 2022, The Author(s).","","","","","","","Universiteit Utrecht, UU","This study was funded by Utrecht University.

Statistics and data science education research offers a variety of frameworks for understanding variability, but new frameworks for domain applications are necessary. This study investigated the professional practices of working engineers to develop such a framework. The Neglected, Acknowledged, or Targeted (NAT) Taxonomy describes whether one’s data analysis choices engage with variability, and whether those choices target the potential consequences of variability, within a given domain. A targeted analysis is the most beneficial rung for engineering applications and is therefore a useful concept for instruction. This study describes the qualitative methods used to develop the NAT Taxonomy and describes how the taxonomy can be used in statistics and data science education, particularly in support of other domain applications. © 2024 The Author(s).

The chapter provides practical advice regarding task design and development of activities that encourage critical analysis of statistical texts (such as in the news media or publications of official statistics agencies). Key topics include: analysis of the nature of ‘context knowledge’ and what are ‘meaningful and important’ contexts that are worthy of attention when teaching for understanding of Civic Statistics; ways to bring ‘meaningful and important’ contexts and texts about them (e.g., from newspapers or digital media) into the classroom and to make sure students understand them; ideas about question-posing and designing suitable tasks about these meaningful and important contexts, in particular how to shape ‘opinion questions’ that can elicit students’ critical reading, reflective thinking, and communication of thoughtful opinions; and ideas about the dispositions and habits of mind (e.g., critical stance, ability to ask ‘worry questions’) and skills (e.g., reading comprehension, critical interpretation) we want students to internalized and be able to activate when engaging statistical messages. Based on the guidelines and examples regarding these topics, the chapter discusses implications and recommendations for curriculum design and for teaching and teachers working both at the high-school, college, and adult education contexts, in mathematics education, statistics and data science education, and related STEM disciplines. © Springer Nature Switzerl and AG 2022.","Contextualization;

In response, there has been growing attention in research and practice emphasizing pre-college groups. This is partly because of the growing recognition-reflected in initiatives like CS4ALL, Code.org, Bootstrap: Data Science, Exploring Computer Science-that learning experiences before college are consequential in sustaining a robust pipeline of computer scientists and engineers. Despite these inroads, there is justifiable concern that existing efforts might not fully support learner development in the necessary conceptual, epistemological, and heuristic styles needed to productively parse and understand 'big data.' This is because computing-based curricula that include data science often involve data curated by others (rather than learners directly), which results in simulated versions of practice instead of engagement that is realistically discursive and messy. This is further complicated by the persistent shortage of K-12 computer science teachers in general and even fewer who can design and implement curricula that support authentic engagement with data science. To address these issues, we leverage culturally relevant and constructionist perspectives in a sandbox (i.e., open-ended) science where tools like Scratch and electronic textiles (E-textiles) have had success expanding possibilities in computing to also include activities where learners can engage broadly along varied pursuits-and encounter challenges that spur computational thinking and problem-solving. The literature suggests that learning activities framed in this way encourage knowledge construction, practice literacies, and seriously impact learner attitudes, interest, and perceptions of growth in the field. This latter set of self-concept measures represents a few of many related key predictors of long-term field participation and persistence. In this work-in-progress scholarship of discovery research, we co-develop, with youth and educators, 'Coding Like a Data Miner' (CLDM)-a sandbox approach to computing-based data science wherein learners access a social media platform, Twitter, to mine, analyze, and understand quantitative and qualitative data sources. In this preliminary work, we assess affordances in co-developing a curriculum that leverages sandbox approaches to data science. Ultimately (and what will be presented in our final submission), we aim to study learning outcomes when high school students' access, analyze and make sense of 'big data' sets of their own. We collaborated with high school teachers in a West Texas/Paso Del Norte region where computer science educators are exceptionally scarce and where there is an urgent and persistent need to support underrepresented learner access to burgeoning areas of computing. Using mixed-methodological approaches (e.g., quantitative analysis of learner pre- and post-survey responses along with qualitative assessments of semi-structured interview data), we address the following research questions: (1) What affordances exist using co-design approaches to develop sandbox data science for pre-college learners? (2) Which computational concepts do students learn when carrying out CLDM activities, (3) Which computational practices do high school students enact when mining, processing, and analyzing big data sets in CLDM? (4) How do learner knowledge and perceptions about data science shift after participating in CLDM? We use contemporary perspectives in computing education, constructionism, and equity to discuss how open-ended sandbox approaches to computing-based data science support learner computational thinking, practice literacies, and field perceptions. © 2023 IEEE.","Computer Science Education; Computer Science Learning; Constructionism; Curriculum Design; Data Science Education","Digital devices; E-learning; Education computing; Engineering education; Smart textiles; Social networking (online); Students; Computer Science Education; Computer science learning; Constructionism; Curricula design; Data miners; Data science education; High school students; Pre-college; Science education; Science learning; Curricula","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2137708); National Science Foundation, NSF","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation (#2137708).

In recent years, machine learning (ML) 's surging impact has sparked discourse about the importance of AI education for young people, and in recent years, several initiatives and projects pursuing the mission of K-12 AI education have emerged. In 2020 Israel's Ministry of Education (MoE) approved a new comprehensive and rigorous ML curriculum targeting 11 and 12th-grade pupils majoring in computer science (CS). The curriculum is meant to be taught by the existing CS teacher workforce. However, since ML theory and practice are fundamentally different from traditional CS [2], implementing this thorough ML curriculum poses substantial challenges in developing an effective teaching workforce to deliver it. In this research, we suggest a solution for this challenge in the form of a blended-learning (BL) program. The online component of this program is based mainly on Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization MOOCs series [3]. The BL program, enhanced with pedagogical training, is also used for the professional development (PD) of the teachers who deliver the program. Out of fourteen CS teachers who participated in the PD in the summer of 2021, ten teach the BL program this year to 273 high-school pupils. Initial results demonstrate the achievement of the curriculum learning goals and provide compelling preliminary evidence that this program enables CS teachers who are new to machine learning to teach this thorough curriculum effectively © 2022 ACM.","artificial intelligence education; blended-learning; computer science education; data science education; K-12 AI education; machine learning education; MOOCs","Deep learning; Education computing; Learning systems; Personnel training; Artificial intelligence education; Blended learning; Computer Science Education; Data science education; K-12 AI education; Learning projects; Machine learning education; Machine-learning; MOOC; Science education; Curricula","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2021, (2021); Shapiro B., Fiebrink R., Norvig P., Education: How machine learning impacts the undergraduate computing curriculum, Communications of the ACM, 61, 11, pp. 27-29, (2018); Ng A., Deep Learning by deeplearning. ai | Coursera, (2017); Perach S., Alexandron G., A MOOC-Based Computer Science Program for Middle School Results, Challenges, and the Covid-19 Effect, pp. 111-127, (2021); Ng A., Machine Learning by Stanford University | Coursera, (2011); Ng A., Widom J., Origins of the modern MOOC (xMOOC), pp. 34-47, (2014); Shah D., Capturing the Hype: Year of the MOOC Timeline Explained, Class Central, (2020); The 50 Most Popular MOOCs of All Time (Updated For 2021)-Online Course Report, (2021); Khandelwal P., Top Machine Learning MOOCs and Online Lectures: A Comprehensive Survey-KDnuggets, KD nuggets, (2016); Neo B., Top 20 free Data Science, ML and AI MOOCs on the Internet. | by Benedict Neo | Towards Data Science, Towards Data Science, (2020); Costa C.D., Top 10 MOOCs for Learning Data Science and Machine Learning, (2020); Garrison D.R., Anderson T., Archer W., Critical Inquiry in a Text-Based Environment: Computer Conferencing in Higher Education, The Internet and Higher Education, 2, 2, pp. 87-105, (1999); Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) | Coursera.","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Ed Board","9th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2022","1 June 2022 through 3 June 2022","New York City","179832","","978-145039158-0","","","English","LS - Proc.

As a result, there is a growing body of research regarding how to teach interdisciplinary collaboration skills. However, much of the work evaluating methods of teaching statistics and data science collaboration relies primarily on self-reflection data. Additionally, prior research lacks detailed methods for assessing the quality of collaboration skills. In this case study, we present a method for teaching statistics and data science collaboration, a framework for identifying elements of effective collaboration, and a comparative case study to evaluate the collaboration skills of both a team of students and an experienced collaborator on two components of effective data science collaboration: structuring a collaboration meeting and communicating with a domain expert. Results show that the students could facilitate meetings and communicate comparably well to the experienced collaborator, but that the experienced collaborator was better able to facilitate meetings and communicate to develop strong relationships, an important element for high-quality and long-term collaboration. Further work is needed to generalize these findings to a larger population, but these results begin to inform the field regarding effective ways to teach specific data science collaboration skills. © 2023 The Author(s).

This paper investigates the potential use of ChatGPT, a generative AI tool, in providing personalized learning experiences for data science education, specifically focusing on Deep Learning. The paper presents a case study that applies the 5Es model to test personalized learning for students using ChatGPT. The study aims to answer the question of how educators can leverage ChatGPT in their pedagogy to enhance student learning, and whether ChatGPT can provide a better learning experience than traditional teaching methods. The paper also discusses the limitations faced during the study and the findings. The results suggest that ChatGPT can be a valuable resource for data science education, providing personalized and instant feedback to learners. However, ethical considerations such as the potential for biased or inaccurate responses and the need for transparency in AI-generated content should be carefully addressed by educators. The study highlights ChatGPT’s potential as a research tool for data science educators to investigate the effectiveness of AI in personalized learning experiences. Overall, this paper contributes to the ongoing dialogue on the role of AI in data science education and provides insights into how educators can utilize ChatGPT to enhance student learning and engagement. © (2023), (Science and Information Organization).

Computer Science educators have investigated how students debug their own code and how students reason through foreign code. While these studies illuminate different aspects of students’ programming behavior or conceptual understanding, a method has yet to be employed that can shed light on students’ learning processes. This type of inquiry necessitates qualitative methods, which allow for a holistic description of the skills a student uses throughout the computing code they produce, the organization of these descriptions into themes, and a comparison of the emergent themes across students or across time. In this article we share how to conceptualize and carry out the qualitative coding process with students’ computing code. Drawing on the Block Model to frame our analysis, we explore two types of research questions which could be posed about students’ learning.

These benefits include the improvement of the metacognitive process, increased motivation and self-efficacy, and the opportunity to refine communication skills. These benefits are particularly valuable in data science education. Though not as widely studied, teaching assignments, where students demonstrate competency through teaching others can be used as a formative assessment tool. This paper describes an ""alternative midterm""experiment conducted in an undergraduate introductory data science class. In this pilot, students were asked to demonstrate their newly learned data science skills by teaching them to individuals without data science backgrounds. The evidence of learning will be illustrated through an in-depth analysis of the students' teaching products. These products consist of two parts: (1) ""Teaching Preparation""materials, such as Python Notebooks containing problems and solutions crafted by the students, and (2) ""Teaching Implementation"", video recordings of real-time interactions between the students and their ""tutees.""The paper will also present qualitative feedback from the students, highlighting promising signs of engagement and acceptance. We will conclude by discussing the challenges and opportunities of implementing this assessment strategy on a larger scale. © 2024 Owner/Author.","data science education; learning-by-teaching","Data Science; Learning systems; Students; Video recording; Active learning methods; Alternative assessment; Assessment strategies; Data science education; Engaging students; Learning by teaching; Metacognitive process; Science course; Science education; Self efficacy; Teaching","","","","","","","Duran D., Learning-by-teaching, Evidence and implications as a pedagogical mechanism.

I detail how the course components align with the principles of alternative grading, students' responses to the course structure, and the lessons I learned along the way. Finally, I close with a discussion of how infusing alternative methods of assessment into the classroom stands to cultivate the diversity continually lacking in computer science and data science.  © 2023 ACM.","alternative assessment;

Educators are increasingly recognizing the value of building communities of practice and adapting and translating courses and programs that have been shown to be successful and sharing lessons learned in increasing diversity in data science education. We describe and analyze our experiences translating a lower-division data science curriculum from one university, University of California, Berkeley, to another setting with very different student populations and institutional context, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). We present our findings from student interviews across two semesters of the course offering at UMBC specifically focusing on the challenges and positive experiences that the students had in the UMBC course. We highlight lessons learned to reflect on the existing large scale program at UC Berkeley, its adaptation and opportunities for increasing diversity in new settings. Our findings emphasize the importance of adapting courses and programs to existing curricula, student populations, cyberinfrastructure, and faculty and staff resources. Smaller class sizes open up the possibility of more individualized assignments, tailored to the majors, career interests, and social change motivations of diverse students. While students across institutional contexts may need varying degrees of support, we found that often students from diverse backgrounds, if engaged deeply, show significant enthusiasm for data science and its applications.  © 2024 ACM.","computational science education; curriculum adoption; data science; diversity in stem education","Data Science; Education computing; Population statistics; Program translators; Students; Baltimore; Computational science; Computational science education; Curriculum adoption; Diversity in stem education; Institutional contexts; Science curriculum; Science education; STEM education; University of Maryland; Curricula","","","","","","","Foundations of Data Science, (2015); Translational Data Science Workshop Reflections, (2018); Berkeley Computing, Data Science, and Society Curriculum Overview, (2022); National Workshop on Data Science Education, (2023); Bile Hassan I., Ghanem T., Jacobson D., Jin S., Johnson K., Sulieman D., Wei W., Data Science Curriculum Design: A Case Study, Proceedings of the 52nd Acm Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (Virtual Event, USA) (SIGCSE '21, pp. 529-534, (2021); Clarke V., Braun V., Hayfield N., Thematic analysis, Qualitative Psychology: A Practical Guide to Research Methods, 3, pp. 222-248, (2015); De Veaux R.D., Agarwal M., Averett M., Baumer B.S., Bray A., Bressoud T.C., Bryant L., Cheng L.Z., Francis A., Gould R., Et al., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annu Rev Stat Appl, 4, pp. 15-30, (2017); Demchenko Y., BelloumWouter Los Tomasz Wiktorski A., Manieri A., Brocks H., Becker J., Heutelbeck D., Hemmje M., Brewer S., EDISON Data Science Framework: A Foundation for Building Data Science Profession for Research and Industry, 2016 Ieee International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom, pp. 620-626, (2016); Donoghue T., Voytek B., Ellis S., Course Materials for Data Science in Practice, Journal of Open Source Education, 5, 51, (2022); Donoghue T., Voytek B., Ellis S.E., Teaching Creative and Practical Data Science at Scale, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 29, pp. S27-S39, (2021); Computing Competencies for Undergraduate Data Science Curricula, (2021); Investing in America's Data Science and Analytics Talent: The Case for Action, (2017); Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering (CEOSE) Biennial Report to Congress, Broadening Participation in America's Stem Workforce, (2013); Mitchell S., Cole K., Joshi A., X+ CS: A Computing Pathway for Non-Computer Science Majors, Asee Mid Atlantic Section Spring Conference, 2020, (2020); Data Science for Undergraduates: Opportunities and Options, (2018); Schwab-McCoy A., Baker C.M., Gasper R.E., Data Science in 2020: Computing, Curricula, and Challenges for the Next 10 Years, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 29, pp. S40-S50, (2021); Bachelor of Arts in Business Technology Administration; Is 296 Adaptations, (2018)","V.P.

This article seeks to build on existing literature concerned with the sociopolitical, cultural, and ethical dimensions of data science education by considering the salience of two interrelated concepts discussed in Asian and Asian American studies and postcolonial studies: techno-Orientalism and the Filipino mimicry stereotype. These concepts describe the positioning of Asians and Asian Americans, and Filipinos in particular, as performance machines who are adept at copying the ideas of dominant groups but incapable of innovation themselves. This article situates techno-Orientalism and the Filipino mimicry stereotype within broader conversations around postcolonial data politics and then argues for the possibility of including these concepts in data science education curricula. Finally, this article discusses Gaskins’s techno-vernacular creativity as one path for resisting techno-Orientalist and mimicry discourses. © 2023, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.","Asian; Asian American; Data science education; Postcolonialism; Race","","","","","","","","Bargagliotti A., Franklin C., Arnold P., Gould R., Johnson S., Perez L., Spangler D.A., PreK-12 guidelines for assessment and instruction in statistics education II (GAISE II): A framework for statistics and data science education, (2020); Benjamin R., Race after technology: Abolitionist tools for the new Jim code, (2019); Bhabha H., Of mimicry and man: The ambivalence of colonial discourse, October, 28, pp. 125-133, (1984); Buolamwini J., Gebru T., Gender shades: Intersectional accuracy disparities in commercial gender classification, Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency, pp. 77-91, (2018); Burke L.E.C.A., Wallace J., Re-examining postcolonial science education within a power-knowledge framework: A Caribbean case study, Science & Education, 29, pp. 571-588, (2020); Conway D., The data science Venn diagram, Retrieved March 8, 2023, From, (2010); Couldry N., Mejias U.A., Data colonialism: Rethinking big Data’s relation to the contemporary subject, Television & New Media, 20, 4, pp. 336-349, (2019); D'Ignazio C., Klein L., Data feminism, (2020); About the coalition, Retrieved March 8, 2023, From; De Kosnik A., Perfect covers: Filipino musical mimicry and transmedia performance, Verge: Studies in Global Asias, 3, 1, pp. 137-161, (2017); de Laat P.B., The disciplinary power of predictive algorithms: A Foucauldian perspective, Ethics and Information Technology, 21, pp. 319-329, (2019); Draper E.B., Data science job growth in 2021 and beyond, The Commons.

These programs focus on developing both ""classic""information science competencies as well as core data science competencies among their students. Since data science competencies are often associated with mathematical and computational thinking, departmental officials and prospective students often raise concerns regarding the appropriate background students should have in order to succeed in this newly introduced computational content of the LIS training programs. In order to address these concerns, we report on an exploratory study through which we examined the 2020 and 2021 student classes of Bar-Ilan University's LIS graduate training, focusing on the computational data science courses (i.e., supervised and unsupervised machine learning). Our study shows that contrary to many of the concerns raised, students from the humanities performed as well (and in some cases significantly better) on data science competencies compared to those from the social sciences and had better success in the training program as a whole. In addition, students' undergraduate GPA acted as an adequate indicator for both their success in the training program and in the data science part thereof. In addition, we find no evidence to support concerns regarding age or sex. Finally, our study suggests that the computational data science part of students' training is very much aligned with the rest of their training program. © Association for Library and Information Science Education, 2023.","computational data science training; data science competencies; data science education","","","","","","","","Ader H.

In translating scholarship around culturally relevant pedagogy from the fields of education and mathematics education we develop the idea of culturally relevant data. We see this development as a key ingredient to implementing culturally relevant pedagogy in teaching data-intensive courses leveraging the centrality of context through data in both statistics and data science to engage students particularly from historically marginalized groups in STEM. We provide suggestions as to ways of finding or creating culturally relevant data and using them in implementing culturally relevant pedagogy to support the learning and flourishing of students in statistics and data science courses. We also present findings from pilot work we have done in implementing these data in statistics courses. Finally, we discuss lingering questions and possible next steps for research in this area.

One of the key reasons for student attrition is the inability of students to develop an identity and a sense of belonging. This study aims to understand the role of a data science learning community in helping students to develop identity and a sense of belonging. The study used a mixed-methods approach to collect and analyze the data. The study used a pre–post survey to understand students’ perceptions regarding identity formation and sense of belonging. The results of the survey study indicated that the perception of identity formation and sense of belonging increased as students progressed through the semester. To further investigate the reasons for the increase in the perception of identity formation and sense of belonging, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted. The results of the interview revealed that living in the data science learning community, participating in various events and interacting with faculty, staff and working with peers of similar interest helped students to develop a data science identity and leader identity, as well as experience sense of belonging. © 2022 by the authors.","communities of practice; data science education; identity formation; learning community; sense of belonging; undergraduate education","","","","","","Purdue Office of the Provost; Lilly Endowment","This research was supported in part by the Lilly Endowment Charting the Future Phase I Planning Grant, through the Purdue Office of the Provost.

However, the actual techniques learners need to become proficient in are still somewhat “in-construction”, as the relatively new field of data science is constantly expanding to meet new data-related demands. Data science education needs to develop innovative means to keep up with this expansion that focus less on proficiency in specific techniques, but rather introduce novices to authentic data practices, and the authentic purposes directing the authentic practices. This paper focuses on a specific practice, the use of simulations to generate and examine data, in the context of authentic scientific Citizen Science research. We provide a case study of one pair of middle school students' engagement in an extended learning sequence including simulation activities inspired by authentic data practices, adapted to also be authentic for young students. While the simulation activity was inspired by the scientists' purposes, our findings illustrate four different actual purposes the students attributed to it. We also show that as the students deepened their engagement with the simulation, they gradually appropriated its intended purpose, alongside articulating more mature views of data-related concepts. The conclusions summarize the four different purposes the students expressed and identify aspects of design that contributed to the gradual re-shaping process of their actual purposes. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Introducing students to data science and statistics has become essential nowadays. Students need to be introduced to authentic data practices, but also to the authentic purposes motivating these practices. Utilizing computerized simulations is a common authentic practice in science and statistics. The pedagogical, intended, use of computerized simulations can be inspired by the authentic purposes but should also be adapted to be authentic for the students. Students may have actual purposes that differ from the authentic and intended purposes. What this paper adds A case study of a pair of middle school students' engagement with a computerized simulation tool, as part of their participation in a Citizen Science project. The students expressed four actual purposes for the simulation. The students' initial purposes differed from the intended purposes, limiting their participation. Key aspects of the overall activity design ultimately supported the students to appropriate the intended purpose of the simulation and more deeply engage with the intended statistical notions. Implications for practice and/or policy It is important to consider that students may attribute purposes that differ from those of the teacher or the activity designer, to any learning activity they engage in. Making the intended purposes more explicit may be helpful, but potentially not enough for students to appropriate them. Researchers' prompts, students' freedom to reshape their use of the simulation tool and productive discussion norms can be beneficial aspects. © 2022 The Authors.

However, differences in disciplinary practices and routines, as well as school organization and culture, can pose barriers to subject integration. The purpose of this study is to describe synergies and tensions between data science and the arts, and how these can create or constrain opportunities for learners to engage in IIR. Design/methodology/approach: The authors co-designed and implemented four arts-integrated data literacy units with 10 teachers of arts and mathematics in middle school classrooms from four different schools in the USA. The data include student-generated artwork and their written rationales, and interviews with teachers and students. Through maximum variation sampling, the authors identified examples from the data to illustrate disciplinary synergies and tensions that appeared to support different IIR processes among students. Findings: Aspects of artistic representation, including embodiment, narrative and visual image; and aspects of the culture of arts, including an emphasis on personal experience, the acknowledgement of subjectivity and considerations for the audience’s perspective, created synergies and tensions that both offered and hindered opportunities for IIR (i.e. going beyond data, using data as evidence and expressing uncertainty). Originality/value: This study answers calls for humanistic approaches to data literacy education. It contributes an interdisciplinary perspective on data literacy that complements other context-oriented perspectives on data science. This study also offers recommendations for how designers and educators can capitalize on synergies and mitigate tensions between domains to promote successful IIR in arts-integrated data literacy education. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Arts-integration; Classrooms; Co-design; Data literacy; Data science education; Informal inferential reasoning; Interdisciplinary learning; Middle school; STEAM","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1908030, 1908142, 1908557); National Science Foundation, NSF","This research was supported by a collaborative DR K-12 grant from the National Science Foundation, Award Numbers: 1908557, 1908030 and 1908142.","Aslan C.E., Pinsky M.L., Ryan M.E., Souther S., Terrell K.A., Cultivating creativity in conservation science, Conservation Biology, 28, 2, pp. 345-353, (2014); Bach B., Stefaner M., Boy J., Drucker S., Bartram L., Wood J., Ciuccarelli P., Engelhardt Y., Koppen U., Tversky B., Narrative design patterns for data-driven storytelling, Data-Driven Storytelling, pp. 107-133, (2018); Ben-Zvi D., Gil E., Apel N., What is hidden beyond the data?

As an emerging interdisciplinary study field, data science curriculum is typically a collection of individual data science related courses from different schools and departments, most of which are teaching data science in a siloed fashion. Therefore, it is necessary to map the landscape of existing curricula and explore how academic libraries can collaborate and contribute to undergraduate data science education. In this study, we analyzed teaching content and topics of over 100 data science related courses at Purdue University to map the landscape and explore roles of academic libraries to support data science education curriculum. Our results indicate most existing courses focused on ‘hard-core’ scientific analytic principles, such as computer science, statistics, and domain-specific skills. Courses of data-oriented skills, such as data management, data ethics, and data communications were limited across disciplines. In addition, data science courses were more likely targeting STEM students at upper levels (3rd and 4th year students). Academic libraries can enrich data science education efforts, by supporting credit courses, certificate programs, and other co-curricular activities to provide learning opportunities to all students, particularly 1st and 2nd year students and non-STEM majors. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","College; Curriculum; Data ethics; Data management; Data science; Education; Libraries","","","","","","","","Aasheim C.L., Williams S., Rutner P., Gardiner A., Data analytics vs. data science: A study of similarities and differences in undergraduate programs based on course descriptions, Journal of Information Systems Education, 26, 2, (2015); Adams J.C., Creating a balanced data science program, Proceedings of the 51st ACM technical symposium on computer science education, pp. 185-191, (2020); Amstatenews, New undergraduate data science programs, (2015); Anderson P., Bowring J., McCauley R., Pothering G., Starr C.; Antell K., Foote J.B., Turner J., Shults B., Dealing with data: Science librarians’ participation in data management at association of research libraries institutions, College and Research Libraries, 75, 4, (2014); Ashton K., That ‘internet of things’ thing, RFID journal, 22, 7, pp. 97-114, (2009); Baumer B., A data science course for undergraduates: Thinking with data, The American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 334-342, (2015); Berry D.M., Introduction: Understanding the digital humanities, In Understanding digital humanities (pp. 1–20), (2012); Borgman C.L., The conundrum of sharing research data, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 63, 6, pp. 1059-1078, (2012); Burgoyne M.B., Chuppa-Cornell K., Beyond embedded: Creating an online-learning community integrating information literacy and composition courses, The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 41, 4, pp. 416-421, (2015); Burton M., Lyon L., Data science in libraries, Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 43, 4, pp. 33-35, (2017); Cassella M., New trends in academic library partnerships: Academic libraries and digital humanities, (2017); Chatfield A.T., Shlemoon V.N., Redublado W., Rahman F., Data scientists as game changers in big data environments, (2014); Chen C.P., Zhang C.Y., Data-intensive applications, challenges, techniques and technologies: A survey on big data, Information Sciences, 275, pp. 314-347, (2014); Chen H.L., Doty P., Mollman C., Niu X., Yu J.C., Zhang T., Library assessment and data analytics in the big data era: Practice and policies, Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 52, 1, pp. 1-4, (2015); Cleveland, Data science: An action plan for expanding the technical areas of the field of statistics, International Statistical Review, 69, 1, pp. 21-26, (2001); CodeSpaces, Top 20 data science certifications and courses online in 2020, (2020); Conway D., The data science venn diagram, (2010); Cox A.M., Kennan M.A., Lyon L., Pinfield S., Developments in research data management in academic libraries: Towards an understanding of research data service maturity, Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 68, 9, pp. 2182-2200, (2017); Danyluk A., Leidig P., Cassel L., Servin C., ACM task force on data science education: Draft report and opportunity for feedback, Proceedings of the 50th ACM technical symposium on computer science education, pp. 496-497, (2019); De Veaux R.D., Agarwal M., Averett M., Baumer B.S., Bray A., Bressoud T.C., Kim A.Y., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 15-30, (2017); Dhar V., Data science and prediction, Communications of the ACM, 56, 12, pp. 64-73, (2013); Dietrich D., Adamus T., Miner A., Steinhart G., De-mystifying the data management requirements of research funders, Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship, 70, 1, (2012); Donoho D., 50 years of data science.

An integral part of many degree programs is a capstone experience, where students complete a major research or real-world project at the culmination of their educational program. In engineering and computer science, many have shown that client-sponsored projects lead to better student engagement and improved training. In this paper, we discuss experiences with developing an interdisciplinary, client-sponsored capstone program in data science and machine learning. We show how we set up the capstone program, including how the program is structured, how projects are set up, how the course is managed, how students are assessed, and outline the newly developed capstone curriculum. Finally, we report results from a cohort of students participating in this capstone program and discuss lessons learned as well as best practices when developing data science capstone programs. © 2021 ACM.","capstone;

Much of the attention has been on the application of AI principles and techniques, especially machine learning, natural language processing and predictive analytics. While AI is only one phase in the data science ecosystem, we must embrace a fuller range of job roles that help manage AI algorithms and systems | from the AI innovators and architects (in CS, Math and Statistics) to the AI technicians and specialists (in CS, IT and IS). Also, it's important that we better understand the current state of the low participation and representation of minoritized groups that further sties the accessibility and inclusion efforts. However, how we learn and what we learn is highly dependent on who we are as learners. In this paper, we examine demographic disparities by race/ethnicity and gender within the information systems educational infrastructure from an evaluative perspective. More specifically, we adopt intersectional methods and apply the theory of public value failure to identify learning gaps in the fast-growing field of data science. National datasets of Master's and Doctoral graduate students in IS, CS, Math and Statistics are used to create an \institutional parity score"" which calculates field-specific representation by race/ethnicity and gender in data science related fields. We conclude by showcasing bias creep including the situational exclusion of individuals from access to the broader information economy, be it access to technologies and data or access to participate in the data workforce or data enabled-economic activity. Policy recommendations are suggested to curb and reduce this marginalization within in-formation systems and related disciplines. © 2021 AIDBEI.

Assignments and projects are essential parts of the DS curriculum as they enable students to gain hands-on experience in real-world DS tasks. However, most current assignments and projects are lacking in at least one of two ways: 1) they do not comprehensively teach all the steps involved in the complete workflow of DS projects; 2) students work on separate problems individually or in small teams, limiting the scale and impact of their solutions. To overcome these limitations, we envision novel synergistic modular assignments where a large number of students work collectively on all the tasks equired to develop a large-scale DS product. The resulting product can be continuously improved with students' contributions every semester. We report our experience with developing and deploying such an assignment in an Information Retrieval course. Through the assignment, students collectively developed a search engine for finding expert faculty specializing in a given field. This shows the utility of such assignments both for teaching useful DS skills and driving innovation and research. We share useful lessons for other instructors to adopt similar assignments for their DS courses. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

These trainings provide young people with the opportunity to learn the skills to work on Data science, with some focused specifically on women and girls. While this is encouraging and brings new opportunities for women and girls to participate in the knowledge economy, it is important to understand the wider context of data science training in Africa, in particular, how women and girls experience their (data science) education, and how this knowledge can impact their lives, sustain livelihoods and bring empowerment. Through a review of the literature, as well as an examination of different pedagogical approaches and practices used by various formal and informal training programs in Africa, we examined the experience of women and girls. We conducted a mapping of the training and networks that have been set up to provide knowledge and skills and to empower women in data science. We highlight some of the facilitators that have positively contributed to a greater participation of women and girls in data science education, while also revealing some of the barriers and structural impediments to fair access to training for women in data science. © 2022 The Author(s).

In this article, we assert that these discussions of teaching and learning must attend to the human dimensions of data work. Specifically, we draw from several established lines of research to argue that practices involving the creation and manipulation of data are shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural tools and practices, and political concerns. We demonstrate through two examples how our proposed humanistic stance highlights ways that efforts to make data personally relevant for youth also necessarily implicate cultural and sociopolitical dimensions that affect the design and learning opportunities in data-rich learning environments. We offer an interdisciplinary framework based on literature from multiple bodies of educational research to inform design, teaching and research for more effective, responsible, and inclusive student learning experiences with and about data. © 2021 The Author(s).","case studies; computers and learning; curriculum; data literacy; data science; mathematics education; science education; technology","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Center for Selective C-H Functionalization, National Science Foundation; Center for Hierarchical Manufacturing, National Science Foundation, CHM, NSF; National Science Foundation, United Arab Emirates, NRF; National Science Foundation of Sri Lanka, NSF, (1054280, 1541676, 1900606)","","Arnold P., What about the P in the PPDAC cycle?

This work depicts the interdisciplinary landscape of iSchools from research outcomes publication knowledge  diffusion input reference output citation and school level based on the WoS publications of 36 iCaucus members in iSchools from 2009 to 2018. Interdisciplinarity is measured by three indicators namely variety balance and intensity. We found that 1 The interdisciplinary characteristics of research outcomes are high subject variety and high subject imbalance. Firstly the papers published by iSchools include 227 disciplines covering 89. 37% of the WoS subject classification the number of disciplines involved in the papers is generally increasing. Secondly the publications are relatively concentrated on a few disciplines such as library and information science and computer science. In addition the overall interdisciplinary intensity of research outcomes is 56. 81% which means 56. 81% of publications involved two or more disciplines reflecting their multidisciplinary nature. 2 The interdisciplinary characteristics of knowledge diffusion are high subject variety and relatively high subject imbalance. Firstly knowledge input and knowledge output cover around 254 WoS subject classifications which shows researches of iSchools are relatively open. Secondly according to the cumulative percentage of the disciplinary distribution the top ten disciplines in knowledge input and output have respectively reached 44% and 46% indicating the relative concentration of knowledge diffusion. In addition the interdisciplinary intensity of knowledge input is 54. 71% indicating that iSchools have cited many papers from other disciplines and their development is mainly related to the cross-border integration of multidisciplinary knowledge. The interdisciplinary intensity of knowledge output is 55. 11% which indicates that iSchools papers have been widely cited by papers from other disciplines and iSchools have formed a strong capacity to output and to infiltrate knowledge to other disciplines. 3 The interdisciplinary characteristics of iSchools members are quite different. The interdisciplinary diversity of UC Irvine Cornell University and Monash University are at the forefront while the interdisciplinary diversity of Humboldt University of Berlin San Jose State University and Renmin University of China lag behind. UC Irvine and Cornell University publish very low percentages of papers in library and information  science. According to the factor analysis of research outcomes knowledge input and knowledge output 36 colleges can be divided into six categories library information computer science data science education research communication and management. The number of colleges in the library and information category is the largest. 4 Library and information science is closely related to iField but significant differences also exist. Library and information science is the subject with the highest proportion of research outputs and the most important source of knowledge for the iField. But the proportion is not high with 22. 87% in research outcomes 13. 05% in reference and 8. 88% in cited paper. It also indicates a downward trend over time. The tendency of iSchools to eliminate library and information science is obvious. In addition though many colleges are currently classified in library and information science subject many of them have a clear trend of diversification. There are several limitations in this study. Taking the iCaucus member as an example to explore the interdisciplinary characteristics of iSchools researches the generalizability of its conclusions needs to be further verified. Second in addition to the diversity balance and intensity combining with more comprehensive indicators may make the conclusion more credible and complete. Finally the sample data from WoS are insufficient to implement a thorough bibliometric analysis. 4 figs. 7 tabs. 56 refs. © 2020, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

Initial work in a quasi-experimental setting suggests that explicitly designing for experiences of failure leads to better learning outcomes than designing for success. We build on this to report on a controlled experimental study where students are exposed to failure-driven, success-driven, or no explicit scaffolding in problem-solving prior to instruction. For assessments of non-isomorphic conceptual understanding, our results align with those from prior work. Despite the similarity in posttest scores, students exposed to failure-driven scaffolding demonstrate higher quality of constructive reasoning than those receiving success-driven scaffolding. Additionally, our study reveals learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding (for both posttest scores and reasoning quality) on assessments of transfer. Several cognitive, affective and meta-cognitive mechanisms are investigated to explain robust learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding in preparatory problem-solving. © 2021 The Author(s)","Data science education; Failure; Higher education; Problem-based learning; Scaffolding","","","","","","","","Ackerman R., Thompson V.A., Meta-Reasoning: Monitoring and control of thinking and reasoning, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 21, 8, pp. 607-617, (2017); Aleven V., Connolly H., Popescu O., Marks J., Lamnina M., Chase C., An adaptive coach for invention activities, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 3-14, (2017); Aleven V., McLaughlin E.A., Glenn R.A., Koedinger K.R., Instruction based on adaptive learning technologies, Handbook of Research on Learning And Instruction, pp. 522-560, (2016); Aleven V., Stahl E., Schworm S., Fischer F., Wallace R., Help seeking and help design in interactive learning environments, Review of Educational Research, 73, 3, pp. 277-320, (2003); Bjork R.A., Dunlosky J., Kornell N., Self-regulated learning: Beliefs, techniques, and illusions, Annual Review of Psychology, 64, pp. 417-444, (2013); Brand S., Reimer T., Opwis K., How do we learn in a negative mood?

Yet it can be a challenge to fit the teaching of such skills into the data science curriculum. Team-Based Learning (TBL) is a pedagogical strategy that can help educators teach data science better by flipping the classroom to employ small-group collaborative learning to actively engage students in doing data science. A consequence of this teaching method is helping students achieve the workforce-relevant data science learning goals of effective communication, teamwork, and collaboration. We describe the essential elements of TBL: accountability structures and feedback mechanisms to support students collaborating within permanent teams on well-designed application exercises to do data science. The results of our case study of using TBL to teach a modern, introductory data science course indicate that the course effectively taught reproducible data science workflows, beginning R programming, and communication and collaboration. Students also reported much room for improvement in their learning of statistical thinking and advanced R concepts. To help the data science education community adopt this appealing pedagogical strategy, we outline steps for deciding on using TBL, preparing and planning for it, and overcoming potential pitfalls when using TBL to teach data science. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this paper, we shall report strategy and development of the DS curriculum standards. Data science education and the development of data scientists are recognised to be quite important in both social and business contexts. The IPSJ DS curriculum standard is developed by integrating various related initiatives and has the following unique features. (1) The DS curriculum standard covers a wide range of related fields to ensure international compatibility through mapping to the ACM Data Science curriculum and the European EDISON Data Science Framework. (2) It collaborates with the IPSJ Data Scientist certification (under development) by referring to the Data Scientist skill checklist (assistant level) developed by the Data Scientist Society of Japan. (3) It clarifies the knowledge and skills required of students majoring in data science. (4) It assigns a time to each educational content so that the curriculum size becomes approximately 675 class hours (60 credits in the Japanese credit system). (5) It collaborates with the Model Curriculum for Mathematics, Data Science and AI Education (literacy level) developed by the Japan Inter-University Consortium for Mathematics and Data Science, supported by the Japanese government. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Curriculum development; Data management; Data science; Data scientist certification; Software engineering; Statistics","Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Data Science; Education computing; Software engineering; Students; Business contexts; Curriculum development; Curriculum standards; Data scientist certification; Educational contents; Science curriculum; Science education; Social context; Unique features; University levels; Information management","","","","","Ministry of Education of Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20K03232); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT","Funding text 1: This research is supported by JSPS Kakenhi #20K03232.; Funding text 2: IPSJ has developed curriculum standards for computing education at the university level for nearly 30 years and has promoted a variety of activities related to computing education at the primary, secondary, high school, and university levels.

The model of the quantified self—in which data about one’s own activities are collected and made into objects of study—provides inspiration for one such approach. By drawing on what one already knows about their self and their prior experiences, it may be possible to bootstrap students’ abilities to interpret and make sense of data. Taking that possibility seriously, this article describes some of the gains observed in students’ statistical reasoning following a quantified self, wearables-based elementary statistics unit and provides a theoretical framework drawing from cognitive psychology, embodiment, and situative perspectives to characterize how prior experience is used as a resource in data sense-making when the data are about students’ own physical experiences. This framework centralizes and interrogates the work of “remembering” prior experiences and articulates how remembering is involved in interpreting quantified self data. Specifically, the framework emphasizes that remembering in service of data interpretation is a reconstructive act that draws from both general and specific embodied resources and that the work of reconstructive remembering in the classroom is both individual and multi-participant work. To demonstrate measured learning gains and illustrate the framework, written assessment results and descriptive cases of student and teacher discussions about quantified self data from two sixth-grade classes participating in a classroom design experiment are provided. Both a discussion of and recommendations for ethical considerations related to quantified self data in education are also provided. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","Doug Clark and Mike Horn; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DRL-1054280)","This work was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation (US) under Grant No. DRL-1054280.

The use of computing software has become ubiquitous and a working knowledge of data science has become increasingly essential for researchers in all domains. However, curriculum development focusing on imparting foundational programming skills and fundamentals of data science for researchers in domains other than computing has been scarce. Thus, there is an unmet need for curriculum development involving computational thinking, programming, and the fundamentals of data science for this audience. Recognizing these growing needs and demands of researchers to learn programming and data science that can then be applied to their area of research or practice, we developed an introductory course in programming and data science for PDRs in biology and medicine. The primary goal of the course was to develop computational thinking skills in PDRs who hail from backgrounds that have traditionally not focused on inculcating computational thinking. This course covered the fundamental concepts of programming using either Python or R - languages that researchers outside the computing community use in numerous ways including the statistical analysis of large datasets that are becoming increasingly common in biomedical research. Further, PDRs enrolled in the course were introduced to some of the broad categories of problems in data science - exploratory data analysis, classification, regression, and clustering - along with relevant algorithms and how they can be applied to real-world datasets in their respective domains using packages or libraries in Python or R. We also report the feedback from the enrolled PDRs, lessons learned, and recommendations for instructors interested in designing similar curricula. Our course focusing on computing and data science education for postdoctoral scholars from a non-computing background demonstrates a promising model for incorporating computing education in other areas of study that do not traditionally have a focus on computing education as well as in continuing education. © 2022 IEEE.","computer science education;

Our work presents a first step in this direction, by leveraging the coding metrics from traditional software engineering (Halstead Volume and Cyclomatic Complexity) in combination with those that reflect a data science project's learning objectives (number of library calls and number of common library calls with the solution code). Through these metrics, we examined the code submissions of 97 students across two semesters of an introductory data science course. Our results indicated that the metrics can identify cases where students had overly complicated codes and would benefit from scaffolding feedback. The number of library calls, in particular, was also a significant predictor of changes in submission score and submission runtime, which highlights the distinctive nature of data science programming. We conclude with suggestions for extending our analyses towards more actionable intervention strategies, for example by tracking the fine-grained submission grading outputs throughout a student's submission history, to better model and support them in their data science learning process. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Coding metrics;

This transition has accelerated over the last five years and training in statistics, machine learning, and data analysis has struggled to keep up. In April 2014, we launched a program of nine courses, the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization, which has now had more than 4 million enrollments over the past five years. Here, the program is described and compared to standard data science curricula as they were organized in 2014 and 2015. We show that novel pedagogical and administrative decisions introduced in our program are now standard in online data science programs. The impact of the Data Science Specialization on data science education in the U.S. is also discussed.

In the intervening decade, the statistics education community has acknowledged that computational skills are as important to statistics and data science practice as mathematics. There remains a notable gap, however, between our intentions and our actions. In this special issue of the Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, we have assembled a collection of articles that (1) suggest creative structures to integrate computing, (2) describe novel data science skills and habits, and (3) propose ways to teach computational thinking. We believe that it is critical for the community to redouble our efforts to embrace sophisticated computing in the statistics and data science curriculum. We hope that these articles provide useful guidance for the community to move these efforts forward. © 2021 The Author(s).

Based on early prototyping conducted with several 7th grade classrooms, we sought to design a tool that would allow students to (a) integrate their data investigations with relevant personal and contextual information; (b) record the step-by-step process and rationale of their data analysis; and (c) reflect on and share these contextual and process-oriented elements of data analysis work with others.

Data science is a new and interdisciplinary STEM-oriented domain, integrating knowledge and skills from computer science, mathematics, and statistics with an application domain, from which the data draw their context and meaning. Data science applications are relevant for various domains, and therefore, a variety of populations are increasingly attracted to learning it. Addressing the theme of the conference, i.e., 'Women in Engineering', in this paper we describe a data science workshop for social sciences and digital humanities researchers. A significant majority (83%) of the participants of this workshop self-identified as women. This gender proportion, the opposite of that prevailing in STEM studies, led us to examine the workshop from a gender perspective. Our results indicate that the women participating in the data science workshop perceived it as an opportunity to acquire research tools rather than programming tools. We suggest that framing the workshop as a research tool workshop and not as a programming workshop reduced prevalent gender barriers in STEM, encouraging a majority of women researchers to participate. In this paper, we elaborate on the participants' perceptions about data science and programming and analyze them based on three theoretical perspectives: expectancy value theory, the interdisciplinary perspective, and the epistemological perspective. © 2021 IEEE.","Data science; Data science education; Gender balance; Interdisciplinary of data science","Engineering education; Population statistics; Professional aspects; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Digital humanities; Expectancy-value theory; Oriented domains; Programming tools; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Science applications; Science workshops; Women in engineering; Data Science","","","","","","","Berman F.D., Bourne P.E., Let's make gender diversity in data science a priority right from the start, PLoS Biology, 13, 7, (2015); Eccles J.S., Wigfield A., From expectancy-value theory to situated expectancy-value theory: A developmental, social cognitive, and sociocultural perspective on motivation, Contemporary Educational Psychology, (2020); Lattuca L.R., Voigt L.J., Fath K.Q., Does interdisciplinarity promote learning?

What does the end-to-end workflow of a data scientist's collaboration with clients look like throughout the lifetime of a project? To investigate this question, we interviewed ten data scientists (5 female, 4 male, 1 non-binary) in diverse roles across industry and academia. We discovered that they work with clients in a six-stage outer-loop workflow, which involves 1) laying groundwork by building trust before a project begins, 2) orienting to the constraints of the client's environment, 3) collaboratively framing the problem, 4) bridging the gap between data science and domain expertise, 5) the inner loop of technical data analysis work, 6) counseling to help clients emotionally cope with analysis results. This novel outer-loop workflow contributes to CSCW by expanding the notion of what collaboration means in data science beyond the widely-known inner-loop technical workflow stages of acquiring, cleaning, analyzing, modeling, and visualizing data. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for data science education, parallels to design work, and unmet needs for tool development.  © 2021 Owner/Author.","collaborative work; data science; interview study","Client needs; Collaborative Work; Domain expertise; End to end; Inner loops; Interview study; Non-binary; Outer loop; Six stages; Work-flows; Data Science","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (IIS-1845900); Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, CISE, (1845900)","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. NSF IIS-1845900.","Alspaugh S., Zokaei N., Liu A., Jin C., Hearst M.A., Futzing and moseying: Interviews with professional data analysts on exploration practices, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 25, 1, pp. 22-31, (2019); Ball A., Review of Data Management Lifecycle Models; Kaj Blomkvist J., Persson J., Aberg J., Communication through boundary objects in distributed agile teams, Association for Computing Machinery, pp. 1875-1884, (2015); Bross I.D.J., The role of the statistician: Scientist or shoe clerk, The American Statistician, 28, 4, pp. 126-127, (1974); Choi J., Tausczik Y., Characteristics of collaboration in the emerging practice of open data analysis, Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, pp. 835-846, (2017); Clark H.H., Brennan S.E., Grounding in communication, Perspectives on Socially Shared Cognition, pp. 127-149, (1991); Corbin J.M., Strauss A.L., Basics of Qualitative Research: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory, (2008); Cross N., Design thinking: Understanding how designers think and work, Bloomsbury, (2011); Cross N., Expertise in Professional Design, pp. 372-388, (2018); Densmore J., There Are Two Types of Data Scientists-and Two Types of Problems to Solve, (2017); Dewey C., An ode to the type a data scientist, Towards Data Science, (2018); Donoho D., 50 years of data science, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 26, 4, pp. 745-766, (2017); Dourish P., Process descriptions as organisational accounting devices: The dual use of workflow technologies, Proceedings of the 2001 International ACM SIGGROUP Conference on Supporting Group Work, pp. 52-60, (2001); Drosos I., Barik T., Guo P.J., DeLine R., Gulwani S., Wrex: A unified programming-by-example interaction for synthesizing readable code for data scientists, Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-12, (2020); Finney D.J., The questioning statistician, Statistics in Medicine, 1, 1, pp. 5-13, (1982); Gallego Gomez C., Puchades Ruiz C., The inclusion of methodologies user experience in the consulting industry: An approach to the experience of capgemini, Proceedings of the XVII International Conference on Human Computer Interaction, (2016); Grandey A.A., Emotion regulation in the workplace: A new way to conceptualize emotional labour, Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 5, pp. 95-100, (2000); Guo P.J., Software Tools to Facilitate Research Programming, (2012); Guo P.J., Kandel S., Hellerstein J.M., Heer J., Proactive wrangling: Mixed-initiative end-user programming of data transformation scripts, Proceedings of the 24th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology, pp. 65-74, (2011); Hayes B., Who Does the Machine Learning and Data Science Work, (2020); Hellmann D., Maitland C., Tapia A., Collaborative analytics and brokering in digital humanitarian response, Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, pp. 1284-1294, (2016); Hicks S.C., Peng R.D., Elements and Principles for Characterizing Variation between Data Analyses, (2019); Hill C., Bellamy R., Erickson T., Burnett M., Trials and tribulations of developers of intelligent systems: A field study, 2016 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC), pp. 162-170, (2016); Russell Hochschild A., The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling, (2012); Hou Y., Wang D., Hacking with npos: Collaborative analytics and broker roles in civic data hackathons, Proc.

Students of Data Science area usually face the difficulty of understanding the complex of real-time data and sophisticated statistical indicators and models. Another difficulty is students are easy to lost interests and patience during the process of learning programming and analysis process, such as R-language. Stock market, as a huge data source and an important data disciplinary, is comparatively easy to attract student attentions. Thus, we developed an intuitive trading platform for education purpose. The platform contains three components: an exploring window, a control windows and a report window. The exploring window shows current and historical stock price trends and related indicators. Several representative stocks from different sectors can be picked and specific time frames can be assigned. The control window allows students to develop their own trading strategies. A trading strategy can be created by either intuitive way, or through single or combinations of indicators, or be built generically though plug-in R-programing module. The report window demonstrates the expected return of a stock in a specific time frame through a specific strategy. A more comprehensive report with detailed transaction information is also provided for back-testing purpose. Students are involved into the development of the software and get experience for R-programming. Preliminary version of the product has been tested and surveyed in a data science classroom. About ten junior Data Science students have practiced and provided feedback. The positive survey results show the feasibility of the approach. In the future, artificial intelligent component will be integrated into the platform.  © 2020 IEEE.","Data Science; R-Programming; Trading Platform","Commerce; Data Science; Education computing; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Surveys; Analysis process; Artificial intelligent; Process of learning; Science classroom; Science education; Statistical indicators; Trading strategies; Transaction information; Students","","","","","","","Metz C., (2017); Wladawsky-Berger I., The Wall Street Journal, (2017); Semeney A., (2017); Machine Learning for Stock Trading Strategies, (2016); Greg Walters S., (2017)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Educational Informatization, CSEI 2020","12 June 2020 through 14 June 2020","Xinxiang","161915","","978-172817007-7","","","English","Proc.

This program was built to support a set of introductory skills-based, higher education courses. We are motivated by work done in project-based learning contexts and culturally responsive pedagogies and are particularly keen to understand how we can scale such kinds of approaches to large and diverse global classrooms. Specifically, we consider the country from which a learner is accessing the course as the key context for our work and discuss two interrelated investigations we have undertaken to understand how this feature interacts with learners’ motivation and learning. Our findings provide insights on how learners respond to location-specific problem-based personalizations in data science education and provides an initial exploration as to how this form of personalization differs depending on the geo-political context of the learners. © 2021, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.","Culturally relevant pedagogy; Data science education; Learning at scale; Personalization","Artificial intelligence; Initial exploration; Large scale data; Political context; Project based learning; Science education; Science learning; Science programs; Specific problems; Data Science","","","","","","","Studying MOOC completion at scale using the MOOC replication framework, In Proceedings of the 8Th International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, pp. 71-78, (2018); Barrows H.S., How to Design a Problem-Based Curriculum for Preclinical Years, (1985); Blumenfeld P.C., Soloway E., Marx R.W., Krajcik J.S., Guzdial M., Palincsar A., Motivating project-based learning: Sustaining the doing, supporting the learning, Educational Psychologist, 26, 3-4, pp. 369-398, (1991); (2015); Donoho D., 50 years of data science, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 26, 4, pp. 745-766, (2017); Dweck C.S., Motivational processes affecting learning, American Psychologist, 41, 10, pp. 1040-1048, (1986); Engle R.A., Conant F.R., Guiding principles for fostering productive disciplinary engagement: Explaining an emergent argument in a community of learners classroom, Cognition and Instruction, 20, 4, pp. 399-483, (2002); Garcia C., Chun H., Culturally responsive teaching and teacher expectations for Latino middle school students, Journal of Latina/o Psychology, 4, 3, pp. 173-187, (2016); Haklev S., From Seminar to Lecture to MOOC: Scripting and Orchestration at Scale (Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation), (2016); Hood N., Littlejohn A., Milligan C., Context counts: How learners' contexts influence learning in a MOOC, Computers & Education, 91, pp. 83-91, (2015); Kerlin S.C., McDonald S.P., Kelly G.J., Complexity of secondary scientific data sources and students’ argumentative discourse, International Journal of Science Education, 32, 9, pp. 1207-1225, (2010); Kizilcec R.F., Brooks C., Advancing a more inclusive science of learning through rapid iterative research with massive open online courses, (2016); Kizilcec R.F., Halawa S., Attrition and achievement gaps in online learning, In Proceedings of the Second (2015) ACM Conference on Learning@ Scale, pp. 57-66, (2015); Kluyver T., Ragan-Kelley B., Perez F., Granger B., Bussonnier M., Frederic J., Et al., Jupyter notebooks--a publishing format for reproducible computational workflows, Proceedings of the 20Th International Conference on Electronic Publishing, pp. 87-90, (2016); Krajcik J.S., Blumenfeld P.C., Project-based learning.

This paper contributes to the literature on data science education by examining the sociotechnical practices of data wrangling—strategies for selecting and managing large, aggregated datasets to produce a model and story. We examined the learning opportunities related to data wrangling practices by investigating youth’s talk-in-interaction while assembling models and stories about family migration using interactive data visualization tools and large socioeconomic datasets. We first identified ten sociotechnical practices that characterize youth’s interaction with tools and collaboration in data wrangling. We then suggest four categories of activities to describe patterns of learning related to the practices, including addressing missing data, understanding data aggregation, exploring social or historical events that constitute the formation of data patterns, and varying data visual encoding for storytelling. These practices and activities are important to understand for supporting future data science education opportunities that facilitate learning and discussion about scientific and socioeconomic issues. This study also sheds light on how the family migration modeling context positions the youth as having agency and authority over the data and contributes to the design of CSCL environments that tackle the challenges of data wrangling. © 2020, International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.","Data visualization; Data wrangling; Family migration; Modeling; Sociotechnical practices; Storytelling","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, CISE, (1341882)","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number 1341882.

It takes tons of time to read the experimental section of thousands of papers and figure out the performance of the data science techniques. In this work, we build an experimental evidence extraction system to automate the integration of tables (in the paper PDFs) into a database of experimental results. First, it crops the tables and recognizes the templates. Second, it classifies the column names and row names into ""method"", ""dataset"", or ""evaluation metric"", and then unified all the table cells into (method, dataset, metric, score)-quadruples. We propose hybrid features including structural and semantic table features as well as an ensemble learning approach for column/row name classification and table unification. SQL statements can be used to answer questions such as whether a method is the state-of-the-art or whether the reported numbers are conflicting. © 2020 ACM.","Data Science Education; Information Extraction; PDF Tables","Extraction; Semantics; World Wide Web; Ensemble learning; Ensemble learning approach; Evaluation metrics; Experimental evidence; Experimental section; Higher education and researches; Hybrid features; State of the art; Data Science","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1849816, IIS-1849816)","This work was supported in part by NSF Grant IIS-1849816.","Agichtein E., Gravano L., Snowball: Extracting relations from large plain-text collections, Proceedings of the Fifth ACM Conference on Digital Libraries.

Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis of research publications on data science was made of papers published in the Web of Science database to identify the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective. Findings: A content analysis of 80 publications is presented. The articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. The category of tools, techniques and applications of data science was most addressed by the authors, followed by data science from the perspective of health sciences, data science education and training and knowledge and skills of the data professional. However, several publications fell into several categories because these topics were closely related. Research limitations/implications: Only publication recorded in the Web of Science database and with the term “data science” in the topic area were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that either were related to other keywords such as “e-science”, “e-research”, “data service”, “data curation”, “research data management” or “scientific data management” or were not present in the Web of Science database. Originality/value: The paper provides the first exploration by content analysis of the field of data science from the perspective of the LIS. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Content analysis; Data science; Education; Information science; Library science; Literature review","Data Science; Database systems; Knowledge management; Publishing; Content analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Education and training; Health science; Library and information science; Library science; Literature reviews; Science education; Science-data; Web of Science; Libraries","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Dhar V., Big data, data science, and analytics: the opportunity and challenge for IS research, Information Systems Research, 25, 3, pp. 443-448, (2014); Alluqmani A., Shamir L., Writing styles in different scientific disciplines: a data science approach, Scientometrics, 115, 2, pp. 1071-1085, (2018); Almugbel R., Hung L.H., Hu J., Almutairy A., Ortogero N., Tamta Y., Yeung K.Y., Reproducible Bioconductor workflows using browser-based interactive notebooks and containers, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 25, 1, pp. 4-12, (2018); Amirian P., van Loggerenberg F., Lang T., Data science and analytics, Big Data in Healthcare, SpringerBriefs in Pharmaceutical Science and Drug Development, pp. 15-37, (2017); Antell K., Foote J.B., Turner J., Shults B., Dealing with data: science librarians’ participation in data management at association of research libraries institutions, College and Research Libraries, 75, 4, pp. 557-574, (2014); Aristodemou L., Tietze F., The state-of-the-art on intellectual property analytics (IPA): a literature review on artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning methods for analysing intellectual property (IP) data, World Patent Information, 55, pp. 37-51, (2018); Barbuti N., Caldarola T., Ferilli S., A graphic matching process for searching and retrieving information in digital libraries of manuscripts, Digital Libraries and Multimedia Archives.

Project-based learning (PBL) is a well-known pedagogical tool for interdisciplinary education. In order to successfully accomplish interdisciplinary learning, students must have sufficient knowledge in each of the separate disciplines. Use of cross-disciplinary teams, for example, is one way to make sure a project team includes specialists in all required disciplines. This, however, is not always the case. In many cases, there are significant knowledge gaps within the project team in one or more of the project domains. Specifically, in our case, fourth-year electrical engineering students are working in pairs on biomedical signal processing projects, which are evidently interdisciplinary in nature. The teams, however, are homogeneous and the students lack the essential medical expertise required to achieve solutions applicable by physicians. Furthermore, students tend to acknowledge this gap only in the advanced phases of the project, and so critical phases, such as goal setting and planning, are performed without the required knowledge. In this article, we present (a) data that supports the existence of this knowledge gap and its effect on students; (b) an intervention program that exposes students to both the required domain knowledge and its importance to their work; and (c) initial data that supports the success of this intervention program in bridging these gaps. © 2020 IEEE.","Biomedical signal processing; Data science education; Interdisciplinary education; Project-based learning","Biomedical signal processing; C (programming language); Engineering education; Cross-disciplinary teams; Electrical engineering students; Interdisciplinary education; Interdisciplinary learning; Intervention programs; Pedagogical tools; Project based learning; Real-life problems; Students","","","","","","","Alvargonza D., Multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, and the sciences, Int.

This growth has resulted in straining program resources at many institutions and causing concern about how to most effectively respond to the rapidly growing demand and provide equal opportunities for all students to pursue their degree. The primary goal of this work is to provide an intelligent solution to automatically identify biases related to race and gender in the content of Data Science related courses such as Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Mining, Data Analytics, and Knowledge Discovery just to name a few. While machine learning allows to build powerful predicting tools, it hasn't been used sufficiently to detect biases rooted in gender and race in educational material. Hence, using effective machine learning techniques we aim to enhance the success rate of undergraduate students in Data Science education and programs while promoting engagement through identifying and mitigating potential gender and racial biases. To this end, we propose a novel bias detection approach which uses a combination of gender identification and sentiment classification for characterization of gender and race in educational contents. Our proposed framework can help educators and course developers to mitigate race and gender biases in their course materials and create an equitable learning experience for students of minority and under-represented groups. © 2022 IEEE.","Data Science; Education; Gender and Racial Equity; Machine Learning","Curricula; Data Analytics; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Students; Data analytics; Educational materials; Equal opportunity; Gender and racial equity; Gender bias; Growing demand; Intelligent solutions; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Undergraduate degrees; Data Science","","","","","","","Tsvetkov Y., Field A., Unsupervised Discovery of Implicit Gender Bias, (2020); Barker M., Inception v3 deep convolutional architecture for classifying acute myeloid/lymphoblastic leukemia, Intel.

Currently significant progress has been made in classwork, while progress in hands-on research experience is still lacking. To help fill this gap, we propose to create data-enabled engineering project (DEEP) modules in the form of interactive Jupyter Notebooks based on real data and applications. We hypothesize that this web-based interactive development and learning environment (IDLE) will enable easy and wide adoption of the DEEP modules by other educators and institutions. In this work, we will present our ideas, the rationale behind the proposed approach, the work in progress, and the future plans for the project. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","Course-based undergraduate research experience; Data science; Data-enabled engineering project; Experiential learning; Workforce development","Computer aided instruction; Engineering education; Course-based undergraduate research experience; Data-enabled engineering project; Education in engineerings; Engineering program; Experiential learning; Research experience; Science and engineering; Science education; Undergraduate research; Workforce development; Students","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Education, ED; U.S. Department of Transportation, DOT; U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA","Dr. Jin Wang is B.

We discuss a proposal for the stealth development of computational skills in students' exposure to introductory data science through careful, scaffolded exposure to computation and its power. Our intent is to support students, regardless of interest and self-efficacy in coding, in becoming data-driven learners, who are capable of asking complex questions about the world around them, and then answering those questions through the use of data-driven inquiry.

To open the “data-science-blackbox” for lower secondary school students, we developed a data science teaching unit focusing on the analysis of environmental data, which we embedded in a ninth-grade computer science class. In this unit, students experience a new insight-driven programming approach, using Jupyter Notebook and the programming language Python for their data analysis. In this paper, we evaluate the second cycle of this project, report how the students coped with the Jupyter Notebooks for doing statistical investigations and describe the insights they gained. © 2022","Data Science Education; Epistemic Programming; Jupyter Notebooks; Python; Reproducible Data Analysis; Statistics Education Research","","","","","","","","Atkinson R.

Data Science is becoming a new recognised field of science that leverages the Data Analytics methods with the power of the Big Data technologies and Cloud Computing that both provide a basis for effective use of the data driven research and economy models. Data Science research and education require a multi-disciplinary approach and data driven/centric paradigm shift. Besides core professional competences and knowledge in Data Science, increasing digitalisation of Science and Industry also requires new type of workplace and professional skills that rise the importance of critical thinking, problem solving and creativity required to work in highly automated and dynamic environment. The education and training of the data related professions must reflect all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science and handling practitioners in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple forms, also providing sufficient lab facilities for practical training. This paper discusses aspects of building customizable and interoperable Data Science curricula for different types of learners and target application domains. The proposed approach is based on using the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) initially developed in the EU funded Project EDISON and currently being maintained by the EDISON Community Initiative. © 2021 IEEE.","Big Data; Curriculum Design; Data Science; Data Science Body of Knowledge; Data Science Competences Framework; Data Science Model Curriculum; Data Scientist Professional; EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF); FAIR principles in Open Education","Data Analytics; Data Science; Engineering education; Industrial economics; Life cycle; Dynamic environments; Education and training; Multi-disciplinary approach; Practical training; Professional competence; Professional skills; Science curriculum; Target application; Data handling","","","","","","","EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF); Data Science Competence Framework; Data Science Body of Knowledge; Data Science Model Curriculum; Data Science Professional Profiles; Demchenko Y., Gruengard E., Klous S., Instructional model for building effective big data curricula for online and campus education, 1st IEEE STC CC and RDA Workshop on Curricula and Teaching Methods in Cloud Computing, Big Data, and Data Science, in Proc.

Data science education has seen rapid growth over the past decade. To provide students with hands-on opportunities to work with real data, many data science programs have advocated for and implemented experiential learning opportunities throughout the curriculum, which has been shown in a wide variety of literature to have many benefits. Most experiential learning opportunities in STEM programs are provided through capstone and engineering design courses; this is becoming increasingly the case in data science programs as well where several universities have developed data science capstone programs in which students work with clients on the client's real-world data sets. While client-sponsored capstone projects are an exemplar of experiential learning, they may pose major challenges to implement and can be particularly resource-intensive for institutions; this is especially the case in data science where the legalities of data sharing may come with additional hurdles. Because of this, we were motivated to develop a novel client-facing data science consulting course that provides a unique experiential learning scenario to both undergraduate and graduate students while requiring much fewer resources and legalities. In our novel data science consulting course, groups of students work directly with real clients in a consulting clinic setting to provide data science guidance and short-term help with data science challenges. Through this process, students learn about the diversity of real-world problems in data science, how to lead consultations with clients effectively as a team, how to frame data science challenges and research possible solutions, and how to communicate solutions to clients in reports and presentations. We leveraged best practices in consulting courses developed in business school settings to design our course. Additionally, the consulting course serves as a community service initiative whereby researchers, clinicians, non-profit and government workers, and industry professionals benefit from the advice and short-term help provided through consultation. In this paper, we report how our consulting course is set up, how clients from both within and outside the university can seek help at the consulting clinic, and how the structure of the course enables students to have firsthand experience working on many real-world data science problems with clients. Finally, we discuss how student performance is assessed in this course, the lessons learned from offering this course, and recommendations for other data science programs in universities that wish to design similar courses. © 2022 IEEE.","consulting course; data science education; experiential learning","Data Science; Facings; Students; Capstone projects; Consulting course; Curriculum development; Data science education; Experiential learning; Innovative practices; Learning opportunity; Real-world; Science education; Science projects; Curricula","","","","","","","Anderson P., Bowring J., McCauley R., Pothering G., Starr C., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, Proceedings of the 45th ACM technical symposium on Computer science education, ser.

Using a designbased research approach, a web-based task was developed. The task was constructed using our design framework and implemented within a face-to-face professional development workshop involving six high school statistics teachers. The teachers were guided through the process of developing a prediction model using: an informal approach; visual prediction intervals; data about movie ratings from an API; and R code that ran in the browser. Our findings from this exploratory study indicate that the web-based task supported the development of new statistical and computational ideas related to predictive modelling and APIs. © 2022","APIs; Data science education; High school teachers; Integrating statistical and computational thinking; Predictive modelling; Task design","","","","","","","","Allaire J., Xie Y., McPherson J., Luraschi J., Ushey K., Atkins A., Wickham H., Cheng J., Chang W., Iannone R., rmarkdown: Dynamic documents for R.

This paper presents a highly innovative course in a UK university that introduces undergraduate medical students to data science. It also discusses a study on student perspectives on the learning and teaching of health data science. Methods: The pedagogical design elements of the Data Science in Medicine course are discussed, along with its syllabus, assessment methodology and flipped classroom delivery. The course has been offered to approximately 630 students over three years. Student perspectives were investigated through three focus groups with the participation of 19 students across different study years in medicine. An experiment was conducted regarding instructor-led vs. video-based modalities of online programming labs, with the participation of 8 students. Results: The course has led to improved data competency among medical students and to a positive change in their opinions about data science. Motivating the course and showing relevance to clinical practice was one of the biggest challenges. Statistics was perceived by focus group participants as an essential data skill. Including data science in the medical curriculum was perceived as important by Year 1 students, while opinions varied between Year 4/5 participants. Video-based online labs were preferred over instructor-led online labs, and they were found to be more useful and enjoyable, without leading to any significant difference in academic performance. Conclusions: Teaching data science to undergraduate medicine students is highly desirable and feasible. We recommend including statistics in the curriculum and practical skill development through simple and clinically-relevant data science tasks, supported through video-based online labs. Further reporting on similar courses is needed, as well as larger-scale studies on student perspectives. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Data science; Education; Health; Health informatics; Medicine; Training","Curriculum; Data Science; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Learning; Students, Medical; Universities; Curricula; Data Science; Laboratories; Medical education; Medicine; Students; Teaching; Focus groups; Health data; Health informatics; Learning and teachings; Medical curriculum; Medical students; Online labs; Science education; Student perspectives; Teaching practices; academic achievement; adult; article; clinical practice; curriculum; data science; female; health data; human; human experiment; learning; major clinical study; male; medical informatics; medical student; skill; teaching; videorecording; medical education; medical student; university; Medical informatics","","","","","Medical School; University of Edinburgh, ED","The authors would like to thank the Usher Institute at the University of Edinburgh for funding this work through an Usher Education Development Grant.

Specifically, the main focus will be on tackling already present challenges in data science education and a solution presented around DS Lab, an interactive computational notebook. The core ideas are represented by the concept of extending the traditional computing notebooks, especially from the Jupyter family, with live visualizations, debugging, widgets, and interactivity during the educational process across all the major platforms: web, Android, and IOS. The features are outlined in several use cases that can be useful in the data-science teaching process, with a primary focus in matrix manipulations, scatter plots, and image filters. Python 3 was used as the main programming runtime and the back-end for providing access to variable values and type information is being described in the form of a runtime-independent pipeline relying on code parsing and injection.  © 2020 IEEE.","Data Science; Development frameworks and environments; Human computer interaction; Interactive systems and tools; Jupyter; Real-Time","Computer applications; Computer science; Educational process; Matrix manipulation; Science applications; Science education; Science teaching; Technical applications; Traditional computing; Type information; Data Science","","","","","","","Apache Zeppelin, (2020); Brython, A Python 3 Implementation for Client-side Web Programming, (2020); Cardoso A., Leitao J., Teixeira C., Using the Jupyter Notebook As A Tool to Support the Teaching and Learning Processes in Engineering Courses, (2019); Felix H., JSCPP, C++ Interpreter Written in JavaScript, (2020); Google Colab, (2020); GNU Bison, (2020); Guo P., Online Python Tutor: Embeddable Web-based Program Visualization for Cs Education, (2013); JavaScript Parser Generator, (2020); Khalid Y., Running Python in the Browser, (2020); Microsoft Azure Notebooks, (2020); Nteract, Official Repository and Source Code, (2020); Project Jupyter, (2020); The Python Scientific Stack Compiled to WebAssembly, Official Repository and Source Code, (2020); PyPy Compiled into JavaScript, Official Repository and Source Code, (2020); Python to Javascript Compiler, (2020); Root Data Analysis Framework, (2020); Skulpt, In-browser Implementation of Python, (2020); Brython Speed Test, (2020); Swift Playgrounds, (2020)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","22nd International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing, SYNASC 2020","1 September 2020 through 4 September 2020","Virtual, Timisoara","167393","","978-172817628-4","","","English","Proc. - Int.

However, the what and how of data science in pre-collegiate education have not yet reached consensus. This paper analyzes two prominent self-identified data science curricula, Introduction to Data Science (Gould et al. 2018) and Bootstrap: Data Science (Krishnamurthi et al. 2020), in order to ascertain what is thus far being presented to schools as data science. We highlight overlapping content and practices by the curricula while noting some key differences between the curricula and with professional practice. Moreover, we examine how lessons are structured and what kinds of data sets are used as well as introduce a measure of data set proximity. We conclude with some recommended areas for further coverage or elaboration in future iterations and future curricular efforts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Curriculum analysis; Data literacy; Data science education; Data science lessons; Secondary school; Statistics education","","","","","","","","Arnold P., Pfannkuch M., Posing comparative statistical investigative questions, Topics and trends in current statistics education research: international perspectives, pp. 173-195, (2019); Bakker A., Biehler R., Konold C., Should young students learn about box plots?, Curricular Development in Statistics Education, pp. 163-173, (2005); Bargagliotti A., Franklin C., Arnold P., Gould R., Johnson S., Perez L., Spangler D., Pre-K-12 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) report II, American Statistical Association, (2020); Ben-Zvi D., Arcavi A., Junior high school students construction of global views of data and data representations, Educational Studies in Mathematics, 45, 1, pp. 35-65, (2001); Bowen G.A., Document analysis as a qualitative research method, Qualitative Research Journal, 9, 2, pp. 27-40, (2009); Burke J., Estrin D., Hansen M., Parker A., Ramanathan N., Reddy S., Srivastava M.B., Participatory Sensing, Proceedings of WSW’06 at Sensys ’06.

Achieving critical and just data literacies is especially challenging in an ideologically polarizing “post-truth” world in which we confront a rising tide of misinformation and fake news, alongside discourse that denigrates politically conservative perspectives. Although reasoning with data is rooted in epistemic processes, the stances people take are-and should be-influenced by values, concerns about maintaining cultural group membership, and concerns about equity and justice. Through a range of approaches, contexts, and age groups, the papers seek to illuminate how to help learners become adept at employing data interpretation conventions, scrutinizing the reliability of data representations, and examining whether data representations render humans and more-than-humans visible or invisible, central, peripheral, unidimensional, or complex. Jointly, the papers examine how to cultivate publics who make use of consequential data representations to negotiate their everyday lives, and who identify and resist datafied injustice. © ISLS.","axiology; data literacies; data science education; epistemology; justice; post-truth","Axiology; Cultural groups; Data literacy; Data representations; Data science education; Epistemology; Group memberships; Justice; Post-truth; Science education","","","","","","","Arastoopour Irgens G., Knight S., Wise A.

To date, the research on the IDS course has primarily focused on pedagogy, professional learning for teachers, and the curriculum. This mixed-methods case study expands our understanding by analyzing the perspective of IDS students at a California public high school. Selfdetermination theory provides a useful frame for interpreting how these students experience the IDS course. The theory focuses on conditions for students to engage in meaningful learning: competence (self-efficacy), autonomy (agency), and relatedness (a sense of belonging). The findings from this case study suggest the IDS students feel confident, empowered, and part of a vibrant community, unlike previous mathematics and statistics courses they may have completed; and use specific language to describe their joy in problem-solving and the accessibility of the course. These findings have implications for the development and refinement of any high school data science course, including IDS. © 2022","Data science education; High school mathematics pathways; Non-traditional high school mathematics; Statistics education research","","","","","","","","Aguirre J., Mayfield-Ingram K., Martin D., The impact of identity in K‒8 mathematics: Rethinking equity-based practices, (2013); Arnold K., Bargagliotti A., Franklin C., Gould R., Johnson S., Perez L., Spangler D., Pre-K‒12 guidelines for assessment and instruction in statistics education II (GAISE II) report, (2020); Investing in America’s data science and analytics talent: The case for action, (2017); Boersma S., Savina F., Re-envisioning the pathway to calculus: Supporting all students, Emerging issues in mathematics pathways, pp. 13-22, (2019); Bressoud D., Insights from the MAA national study of college calculus, Mathematics Teacher, 109, 3, pp. 178-185, (2015); Burdman P., Degrees of freedom: Diversifying math requirements for college readiness and graduation, PACE & Learning Works, (2015); Burdman P., The Mathematics of opportunity: Rethinking the role of math in educational equity, (2018); California school dashboard, (2017); Mathematics framework, (2022); The transition from high school to postsecondary mathematics designing modernized and socially just pathways through collaboration, (2020); Carnevale A.

In general, the processing related to the higher-order tensor is so complicated that we have been developing understanding support tools for it using 3D puzzles from the viewpoint of making students interested. However, although these tools have been tried by students in graduation studies and other some occasions, their introduction into lectures was one issue. Therefore, in this study, we developed a new programming exercise material for the higher-order tensor, which is supposed to be used in data science subjects, by using a 3D puzzle. This learning material is also composed of Microsoft Teams, and students can access the material remotely to learn programming. In this paper, several students actually tried this material. As a result, it was found that the students themselves could create and submit assignment reports by viewing explanatory videos and performing exercises. From this, it is expected that this material will be able to introduce to data science courses, including online use. © 2021 by the authors.","3D puzzle; Data science education; Higher-order tensor; Programing materials; R; Remote exercise","","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP18K11596)","This work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI (Grants-in Aid for Scientific Research) under Grant No. JP18K11596.","Elden L., Matrix methods in data mining and pattern recognition, SIAM, (2007); Ishida A., Yamamoto N., Murakami J., Oishi N., Solving 3-D puzzles using tensor decomposition and application to education of multidimensional data analysis, International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing, 8, 5, pp. 447-453, (2018); Yamamoto N., Murakami J., Ishida A., Using 3D puzzles to help understand tensor decomposition programming, Proc. the Annual Software Symposium in Kumamoto, pp. 115-124, (2019); Yamamoto N., Ishida A., Oishi N., Murakami J., Development of teaching tool for supporting understanding of tensor decomposition using MacMahon‟s coloured cubes, International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 10, 1, pp. 14-19, (2020); Team R.

As an interdisciplinary science it integrates knowledge and methods from computer science, mathematics and statistics, and the domain knowledge of the data. As data science is still forming as a domain, several points of view exist on how to teach data science. The curriculum of many undergraduate data science programs includes advanced knowledge and skills in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and one or more data domains. Several initiatives for designing high school data science curricula have emerged recently. Since it is unrealistic to teach all the above-mentioned advanced topics at the high school level, the high school data science curriculum focuses on a broad understanding of the data science workflow rather than on mathematical and algorithmic details that characterize undergraduate programs. High school computer science pupils, however, are expected to have a deep understanding of algorithms, as algorithms are the heart of computer science. In this paper, we present our attempt to adapt a data science course to computer science high school pupils that incorporates both a broad view on data science and data workflow, as well as deep understanding of data processing algorithms and specifically, machine learning. This course is taught for 10th grade computer science pupils in an Israeli public school, and was also taught in a summer workshop for computer science teachers.  © 2020 ACM.","computer science education; Data science education; high school; interdisciplinary; K12; secondary education","Curricula; Data handling; Engineering education; Equalizers; Machine learning; Teaching; Computer science teachers; Data processing algorithms; Domain knowledge; Interdisciplinary fields; Science curriculum; Science programs; Summer workshops; Undergraduate program; Data Science","","","","","","","Anderson P., Bowring J., McCauley R., Pothering G., Starr C., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, Proceedings of the 45th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 145-150, (2014); Berman F., Rutenbar R., Hailpern B., Christensen H., Davidson S., Estrin D., Franklin M., Martonosi M., Raghavan P., Stodden V., Et al., Realizing the potential of data science, Commun.

This emergence also extends to undergraduate education, whereby a growing number of institutions now offer degree programs in data science. However, there is considerable variation in what the field actually entails and, by extension, differences in how undergraduate programs prepare students for data-intensive careers. We used two seminal frameworks for data science education to evaluate undergraduate data science programs at a subset of 4-year institutions in the United States; developing and applying a rubric, we assessed how well each program met the guidelines of each of the frameworks. Most programs scored high in statistics and computer science and low in domain-specific education,ethics, and areas of communication. Moreover, the academic unit administering the degree program significantly influenced the course-load distribution of computer science and statistics/mathematics courses. We conclude that current data science undergraduate programs provide solid grounding in computational and statistical approaches, yet may not deliver sufficient context in terms of domain knowledge and ethical considerations necessary for appropriate data science applications. Additional refinement of the expectations for undergraduate data science education is warranted. © Copyright 2021 Oliver and McNeil Distributed under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0","Computer science; Curricula; Data science; Education; Ethics; Machine learning; Statistics","Application programs; Curricula; Education computing; Electric grounding; Philosophical aspects; Statistics; Students; Ethical considerations; Interdisciplinary fields; Load distributions; Science applications; Science education; Statistical approach; Undergraduate education; Undergraduate program; Data Science","","","","","","","Aasheim CL, Williams S, Rutner P, Gardiner A., Data analytics vs. data science: a study of similarities and differences in undergraduate programs based on course descriptions, Journal of Information Systems Education, 26, pp. 103-115, (2015); Anderson P, Bowring J, McCauley R, Pothering G, Starr C., An undergraduate degree in data science: curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, SIGCSE 2014: Proceedings of the 45th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 145-150, (2014); Anderson P, McGuffee J, Uminsky D., Data science as an undergraduate degree, SIGCSE 2014 - Proceedings of the 45th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 705-706, (2014); Berthold MR., What Does it take to be a successful data scientist?, Harvard Data Science Review, 1, pp. 1-6, (2019); Bok D., Higher education in America, (2013); Christensen RHB., Ordinal: regression models for ordinal data, (2019); Dastin J., Amazon scraps secret AI recruiting tool that showed bias against women, Reuters, (2018); De Veaux RD, Agarwal M, Averett M, Baumer BS, Bray A, Bressoud TC, Bryant L, Cheng LZ, Francis A, Gould R, Kim AY, Kretchmar M, Lu Q, Moskol A, Nolan D, Pelayo R, Raleigh S, Sethi RJ, Sondjaja M, Tiruviluamala N, Uhlig PX, Washington TM, Wesley CL, White D, Ye P., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, 1, pp. 15-30, (2017); DiMaggio PJ, Powell WW., The iron cage revisited: institutional isomorphism and collective rationality in organizational fields, American Sociological Review, 48, 2, pp. 147-160, (1983); Donoho D., 50 Years of data science, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 26, 4, pp. 745-766, (2017); Irizarry RA., The role of academia in data science education, Harvard Data Science Review, 2, 1, (2020); Kafka AC., With student interest soaring, Berkeley creates new data-sciences division: the chronicle of higher education, (2018); Lum K, Isaac W., To predict and serve?, Significance, 13, 5, pp. 14-19, (2016); Data science for undergraduates, (2018); Obermeyer Z, Powers B, Vogeli C, Mullainathan S., Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations, Science, 366, 6464, pp. 447-453, (2019); O'Neil C., Weapons of math destruction, (2017); Parry M., Data scientists in demand: new programs train students to make honest sense of numbers (The Trends Report), Chronicle of Higher Education, 64, (2018); Provost F, Fawcett T., Data science and its relationship to big data and data-driven decision making, Big Data, 1, 1, pp. 51-59, (2013); R: a language and environment for statistical computing, (2020); Saltz JS, Dewar NI, Heckman R., Key concepts for a data science ethics curriculum, Proceedings of the 49th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 952-957, (2018); Slaughter S, Leslie LL., Academic capitalism: politics, policies, and the entrepreneurial university, (1997); Slaughter S, Rhoades G., Academic capitalism and the new economy: markets, state, and higher education, (2004); Stefanidis A, Fitzgerald G., IS education research: review of methods of surveying the IS curriculum to support future development of IS courses, Information Systems:Education, Applications, Research, pp. 1-11, (2014); Swanstrom R., College & university data science degrees, (2020); Tang R, Sae-Lim W., Data science programs in U.S. higher education: an exploratory content analysis of program description, curriculum structure, and course focus, Education for Information, 32, 3, pp. 269-290, (2016); About Carnegie classification, (2018); Wickham H, Averick M, Bryan J, Chang W, McGowan LD, Francois R, Grolemund G, Hayes A, Henry L, Hester J, Kuhn M, Pedersen TL, Miller E, Bache SM, Muller K, Ooms J, Robinson D, Seidel DP, Spinu V, Takahashi K, Vaughan D, Wilke C, Woo K, Yutani H., Welcome to the tidyverse, Journal of Open Source Software, 4, 43, (2019)","J.C.

The effort is led by members of a joint data science criteria subcommittee appointed by ABET's Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) and CSAB (the lead society for computing accreditation). Establishing data science accreditation criteria is a notable milestone in the maturing data science discipline, indicating the presence of an accepted body of knowledge, standards of practice, and ethical codes for practitioners. This position paper motivates the effort and discusses prior work towards defining data science education requirements. It describes the ongoing process for creating and obtaining approval of the accreditation criteria, and how feedback was and will be solicited from the computing and statistical communities. The current draft data science criteria, which was approved in July 2020 by the relevant ABET bodies for a year of public review and comment, is presented. These criteria emphasize the three pillars of data science: Computing foundations, mathematical/statistical foundations, and experience in at least one data application domain. This report thus serves both to inform and to stimulate the academic discussion needed to finalize appropriate data science accreditation by ABET. © 2021 ACM.","computing education; data analytics programs; data science programs; program accreditation","Accreditation; Education computing; Abet accreditation criterion; Accreditation criteria; Body of knowledge; Computing Accreditation Commission; Data application; Science disciplines; Science education; Science programs; Data Science","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1433736, 1922169, 2021287)","Our thanks are due to Lillian (Boots) Cassel, Hridesh Rajan, Barbara Price, and Heikki Topi, who served on the Data Science Criteria Subcommittee and helped to develop the Data Science Criteria proposal drafts.

The radical growth in recent years in the availability of data and of the computational resources required to process them, has led to a corresponding increase in demand for data scientists. As a result, new data science education programs are opening at a growing rate. Over the past few years, several papers on data science programs were published, focusing on their curricular aspects. The pedagogy of those programs, however, has received only little attention. To partially close this gap, my doctoral research focuses on the pedagogical aspects of data science. The pilot phase of the research was carried out in graduate, undergraduate, and high school data science programs. The results of the pilot research are organized by a framework of ten challenges of data science education whose purpose is to improve our understanding of the pedagogical challenges of data science education for various populations and to develop pedagogical methods for coping with them. The current stage of research aims to validate this framework. © 2020 Owner/Author.","computer science education; data science education","Population statistics; Computational resources; Doctoral research; Pedagogical aspects; Pedagogical method; Radical growth; Research focus; Science education; Science programs; Data Science","","","","","","","Berman F., Et al., Realizing the potential of data science, Commun Acm, 61, 4, pp. 67-72, (2018); Raj R.K., Et al., Data science education: Global perspectives and convergence, Annu.

Many teachers’ preparation for and experiences teaching statistical modeling have focused on probabilistic models. Subsequently, much of the research literature related to the teachers’ understanding has focused on probabilistic models. This study explores the extent to which secondary statistics teachers appear to understand ideas of statistical modeling, specifically the processes of model building and evaluation, when introduced using classification trees, a type of algorithmic model. Results of this study suggest that while teachers were able to read and build classification tree models, they experienced more difficulty when evaluating models. Further research could continue to explore possible learning trajectories, technology tools, and pedagogical approaches for using classification trees to introduce ideas of statistical modeling. © 2021 The Author(s).

Although extracurricular efforts already exist for many computationally intensive disciplines, their support of data science education has significantly helped in coping with the speed of innovation in data science practice and formal curricula. While the proliferation of ad hoc efforts is an indication of their popularity, less has been documented about the needs that they are designed to meet, the limitations that they face, and practical suggestions for holding successful efforts. To holistically understand the role of different ad hoc formats for data science, we surveyed organizers of ad hoc data science education efforts to understand how organizers perceived the events to have gone-including areas of strength and areas requiring growth. We also gathered recommendations from these past events for future organizers. Our results suggest that the perceived benefits of ad hoc efforts go beyond developing technical skills and may provide continued benefit in conjunction with formal curricula, which warrants further investigation. As increasing numbers of researchers from computational fields with a history of complex data become involved with ad hoc efforts to share their skills, the lessons learned that we extract from the surveys will provide concrete suggestions for the practitioner-leaders interested in creating, improving, and sustaining future efforts. © 2020 DeMasi et al.","","Curriculum; Data Science; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires; Curricula; Surveys; Ad hoc datum; Complex data; Computational field; Perceived benefits; Science education; Technical skills; article; data science; education; human; human experiment; leadership; physician; skill; curriculum; procedures; questionnaire; Data Science","","","","","","","Zweben S., Bizot B., 2017 CRA taulbee survey, Computing Research News, 30, 5, pp. 1-47, (2018); Cao L., Data science: A comprehensive overview, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 50, 3, (2017); Allen G., Benger W., Hutanu A., Jha S., Loffler F., Schnetter E., A practical and comprehensive graduate course preparing students for research involving scientific computing, Procedia Computer Science, 4, pp. 1927-1936, (2011); Atwood T.K., Bongcam-Rudloff E., Brazas M.E., Corpas M., Gaudet P., Lewitter F., Et al., GOBLET: The global organisation for bioinformatics learning, education and training, PLoS Comput Biol., 11, 4, (2015); Baumer B., A data science course for undergraduates: Thinking with data, The American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 334-342, (2015); Cetinkaya-Rundel M., Rundel C., Infrastructure and tools for teaching computing throughout the statistical curriculum, The American Statistician, 72, 1, pp. 58-65, (2018); Clark D., Culich A., Hamlin B., Lovett R., BCE: Berkeley's common scientific compute environment for research and education, Proceedings of the 13th Python in Science Conference (SciPy 2014), pp. 5-13, (2014); Hill B.M., Dailey D., Guy R.T., Lewis B., Matsuzaki M., Morgan J.T., Democratizing data science: The community data science workshops and classes, Big Data Factories, pp. 115-135, (2017); Jacobs C.T., Gorman G.J., Rees H.E., Craig L.E., Experiences with efficient methodologies for teaching computer programming to geoscientists, Journal of Geoscience Education, 64, 3, pp. 183-198, (2016); Millman J.K., Brett M., Barnowski R., Poline J.B., Experiences with efficient methodologies for teaching computer programming to geoscientists, Frontiers in Neuroscience, 12, (2018); Creating Institutional Change in Data Science, (2018); West J., Portenoy J., The data gold rush in higher education, Big Data Is Not A Monolith, (2016); Sugimoto C.R., Ekbia H.R., Mattioli M., The data gold rush in higher education, Big Data Is Not A Monolith, MITP, pp. 129-139, (2016); Huppenkothen D., Arendt A., Hogg D.W., Ram K., VanderPlas J.T., Rokem A., Hack weeks as a model for data science education and collaboration, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 115, 36, pp. 8872-8877, (2018); Rokem A., Aragon C., Arendt A., Fiore-Gartland B., Hazelton B., Hellerstein J., Et al., Building an urban data science summer program at the university of Washington eScience institute, Bloomberg Data for Good Exchange Conference, (2015); Wilson G., Software carpentry: Lessons learned, F1000Research, (2016); Alnoamany Y., Borghi J.A., Towards computational reproducibility: Researcher perspectives on the use and sharing of software, PeerJ., 4, (2018); Wilson G., Aruliah D.A., Brown C.T., Hong N.P.C., Davis M., Guy R.T., Et al., Best practices for scientific computing, PLoS Biol., 12, 1, (2014); Holdgraf C., Culich A., Rokem A., Deniz F., Alegro M., Ushizima D., Portable learning environments for hands-on computational instruction: Using container-and cloud-based technology to teach data science, Proceedings of the Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing 2017 on Sustainability, Success and Impact.

Organizations that pursue data intelligence consider Data Science professionals immensely relevant. However, universities and higher education institutions are starting to offer undergraduate programs and courses for Data Science education. In this sense, EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) is presented as a relevant framework to further the education of Data Science Professionals. Thus, this article addresses the integration of EDSF with ADDIE Model, an instructional design model, capable of enabling the construction of an Instructional System (IS). Based on the Learning Outcomes (LO) of the EDSF Model Curriculum Data Science (MC-DS), the article proposes an integrated approach of these LOs along with the phases of ADDIE Model supporting the construction of a Data Science Instructional System (DSIS). This integrated approach assists the understanding of the development of a DSIS and its learning objects, with its technological needs, such as: hardware environment, programming environments (IDEs, scripts, etc.), database models (SQL and NoSQL), massive data storage and processing tools, visualization tools, among others.  © 2021 IEEE.","data science; EDISON framework; instructional design; professional education","Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Data Science; Data visualization; Digital storage; Education computing; Integrated control; Learning systems; ADDIE model; Computing Intelligence; Data engineering; EDISON framework; Engineering intelligence; Instructional designs; Instructional system; Integrated approach; Professional education; Science education; Decision making","","","","","Data Science Framework; EDSF; Polytechnic School of University of São Paulo; European Commission, EC","Funding text 1: III.

The challenges we encountered preliminary data collection include course catalog unavailability, disambiguation, and lack of data for investigating the evolution of courses. Next steps of this study are to expand our data collection to all the iSchool members and create an interactive data dashboard with periodically automatic data acquisition over time.

This is especially challenging when teaching massively open online courses (MOOCs) where students come from across the globe and have a variety of access to and types of computing systems. There are additional challenges with using sensitive health information for clinical data science education. Here we describe the development and performance of a computing platform developed to support a series of MOOCs in clinical data science. This platform was designed to restrict and log all access to health datasets while also being scalable, accessible, secure, privacy preserving, and easy to access. Over the 19 months the platform has been live it has supported the computation of more than 2300 students from 101 countries. ©2021 AMIA - All rights reserved.","","Data Science; Education, Distance; Humans; Students; education; human; student","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","1942597X","","","34457158","English","AMIA Annu Symp Proc","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115266318"

Tim Brown, president, and CEO of IDEO, defines design thinking as “A human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success”. The application of design thinking has been witnessed to be the road to develop innovative applications, interactive systems, scientific software, healthcare application, and even to utilize Design Thinking to re-think business operation as the case of Airbnb. Recently, there has been a movement to apply design thinking to machine learning and artificial intelligence to ensure creating the “waw” affect to consumers. ACM Taskforce on Data Science program states that “Data Scientists should be able to implement and understand algorithms for data collection and analysis. They should understand the time and space considerations of algorithms. They should follow good design principles developing software, understanding the importance of those principles for testability and maintainability” However, this definition hides the user behind the machine who works on data preparation, algorithm selection and model interpretation. Thus, Data Science program to include design thinking to ensure meeting the user demands, generating more usable machine learning tools, and developing new ways of framing computational thinking. In this poster, we describe the motivation behind injecting DT in Data Science programs, an example course, its learning objective and teaching modules. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Data science; Design thinking; Higher education; Machine learning","Application programs; Data Science; Education computing; Product design; Business success; Corporates; Design thinking; Development process; High educations; Interactive system; Product and services; Science education; Science projects; Scientific softwares; Machine learning","","","","","","","Dragicevic N., Lee W., Tsui E., Supporting service design with storyboards and diagrammatic models, Proceedings of the Theory and Applications in the Knowledge Economy Conference, pp. 457-469, (2017); Elmansy R., Design Thinking Case Study: Innovation at Apple, (2020); Mehrabi N., Morstatter F., Saxena N., Lerman L., Galstyan A., A survey on bias and fairness in machine learning, Preprint Arxiv, 1908, (2019); Machine Leaning Bias, (2020); Schmarzo B., Design Thinking Humanizes Data Science, (2019)","S.I.

A new interdisciplinary data science course aims to merge STEM and humanities perspectives starting at the very beginning of the data science curriculum. Existing literature suggests that humanities integration can make STEM courses more appealing to a wider range of students, including women and students of color, and enhance student learning of essential concepts and foundational reasoning skills, such as those collectively known as data acumen.

In invoking exponential growth, mathematical modelling, statistical analysis, and the like, these data visualizations invite opportunities for mathematics teaching and learning. Yet data visualizations are social texts, authored from specific points of view, that narrate particular, and often consequential, stories. Their fundamental reliance on quantification and mathematics cements their social positioning as supposedly objective, reliable, and neutral. The reading of any data visualization demands unpacking the role of mathematics, including how data and variables have been formatted and how relationships are framed to narrate stories from particular points of view. We present an approach to a critical reading of data visualizations for the context of mathematics education that draws on three interrelated concepts: mathematical formatting (what gets quantified, measured, and how), framing (how variables are related and through what kind of data visualization), and narrating (which stories the data visualization tells, its potential impacts and limits). This approach to reading data visualisations includes a process of reimagining through reformatting, reframing and renarrating. We illustrate this approach and these three concepts using data visualizations published in the New York Times in 2020 about COVID-19. We offer a set of possible questions to guide a critical reading of data visualizations, beyond this set of examples. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","COVID-19; Critical mathematics education; Critical pedagogy; Data science education; Data visualizations; Graph reading","","","","","","","","Adam D., A guide to R – the pandemic’s misunderstood metric, Nature., (2020); Ainley J., Re-viewing graphing: Traditional and intuitive approaches, For the Learning of Mathematics, 15, 2, pp. 10-16, (1995); Baicker K., Dube O., Mullainathan S., Pope D., Wezerek G., Is it safer to visit a coffee shop or a gym?, The New York Times., (2020); Bell A., Janvier C., The interpretation of graphs representing situations, For the Learning of Mathematics, 2, 1, pp. 34-42, (1981); Junior high school students’ construction of global views of data and data representations, Educational Studies in Mathematics, 45, pp. 35-65, (2001); Data visualization literacy: Definitions, conceptual frameworks, exercises, and assessments, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 116, 6, pp. 1857-1864, (2019); Boyd D., Crawford K., Critical questions for Big Data, Information, Communication & Society, 15, 5, pp. 662-679, (2012); Bruner J., The narrative construction of reality, Critical Inquiry, 18, 1, pp. 1-21, (1991); Burton L., Mathematical thinking: The struggle for meaning, Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, 15, 1, pp. 35-49, (1984); Calarco J.M., Anderson E., Meanwell E., Knopf A., ‘Let’s Not Pretend It’s Fun’: A mixed-methods analysis of increased time with children and mothers’ well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A real-life case study of a hackathon for college participants who are prospective students of a university data science programme is demonstrated. The university-industry collaborative approach of the hackathon provides several benefits for its stakeholders, namely promoting the reputation and recognition of the university's data science programme; offering creative and innovative solutions to the enterprise's workplace problems; encouraging the adoption of the technology vendor's platform, and finally, enhancing the teaching and learning experience for the college students and lecturers. This paper provides a structured framework and recommends practical principles and guidelines for designing effective hackathons that can bring about mind-set change and real-world business transformation.  © 2021 IEEE.","Data Science Education; Education Innovation; Hackathon Education","Data Science; Engineering education; Data science education; Digital transformation; Education innovation; Hackathon education; Hybrid approach; Science education; Science projects; Technological innovation; Technology vendors; University-industry collaboration; Students","","","","","","","Angelidis P., Berman L., Casas-Perez M.L., Et al., The Hackathon Model to Spur Innovation Around Global MHealth.

In this module, they use CODAP's “Arbor” plug-in to manually build decision trees and understand how to systematically build trees based on data. Further on, the students use a menu-based environment in a Jupyter Notebook to apply an algorithm that automatically generates decision trees and to evaluate and optimize the performance of these.

Keeping in mind, the growing importance of data science, under-graduates need to be introduced to data science courses in their first year of under-graduation itself. Although first year undergraduates are furnished with the required mathematical and statistical concepts during their higher secondary education, a requirement of understanding sophisticated programming concepts hamstrings universities from offering courses in data science to first year undergraduates. As an outcome of our research, we propose a software named MetaData. MetaData abstracts all levels of implementation and helps students better understand the fundamental concepts in data science by observing the applicability of these concepts on real-world datasets. We justify the effectiveness of the tool through a data science classroom scenario, wherein 44 first year undergraduates were encouraged to use the tool and provide constructive feedback. © 2020 ACM.","Data Science Education; Data Science Lifecycle; Pedagogy; User-friendly Tool","Metadata; Constructive feedback; Fundamental concepts; Programming concepts; Real-world datasets; Science classroom; Science course; Science education; Statistical concepts; Data Science","","","","","","","IIT Bombay: An Indian University Curriculum; De Veaux Richard D., Agarwal M., Averett M., Baumer B.S., Bray A., Bressoud T.C., Bryant L., Cheng L.Z., Francis A., Gould R., Et al., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, Annu.

Since the 1990s, Indian software firms have developed expertise in carrying out outsourced back-office tasks and mid-level IT services like data entry, managing call centres, and performing software quality testing for foreign companies taking advantage of a technically trained local workforce. The trend of automating manual work practices in the IT industry has generated a different kind of demand for data sciences directed at upskilling and job readiness. India is witnessing a market-oriented groundswell of data science and IT skill tutoring ‘shops’, resituating science and engineering education. In this chapter we report from ethnographic research conducted in two IT skill training parks to underpin arguments about emerging neo-educational learning structures suited to a data science education for new livelihood opportunities in an IT-accredited India. Our chapter makes a case for looking at ‘data studies’ from an ethnographic perspective uncovering a ‘program’ of upward mobility through IT skilling and employment. What directions might data studies about tutoring data science skills in the Indian context lead to? Excerpts presented here from field research imagine new livelihoods, aspirations, and technology skills that are more often than not a reflection of the power of data science education. © 2022, The Author(s).","Data science education; Employment; India; IT industry; IT Skills","","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (RES-063-27-0089)","1This research was funded by ESRC early career fellowship awarded to HN (Grant number—RES-063-27-0089).","Akerlof G.A., The market for lemons: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, 3, pp. 488-500, (1970); Altbach P.G., The dilemma of change in Indian higher education, Higher Education, 26, 1, pp. 3-20, (1993); The Economist, March, (2017); Davenport T.H., Patil D.J., Data scientist: The sexiest job of the 21st century, Harvard Business Review, 90, 10, pp. 70-76, (2012); Espinoza V., Social networks among the urban poor: Inequality and integration in a Latin American city, Networks in the Global Village, pp. 147-184, (1999); Fox R., From Zamindar to Ballot Box: Community Change in a North Indian Market Town, (1969); Fuller C.J., Narasimhan H., Engineering colleges, ‘exposure’ and information technology professionals in Tamilnadu, Economic and Political Weekly, 41, 3, pp. 258-262, (2006); Garrido M., Badshah A., Coward C., Deconstructing ICT Skills and Employability, Vol 5, Issue 2 | Summer, (2009); Gohain H., In search of scholarship, Economic and Political Weekly, 32, 1-2, pp. 26-27, (1997); Gupta D., Whither the Indian village: Culture and agriculture in ‘rural’ India, Economic and Political Weekly, 40, 8, pp. 751-758, (2005); Jiazhi F., Steinmuller H., Leadership programmes: Success, self-improvement, and relationship management among new middle-class Chinese, Ethnos, (2021); Joshi M., Joshi T., Rangaswamy N., Scaling classroom IT skill tutoring: A case study from India, Proceedings of the 2018 ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Paper, pp. 1-12, (2018); Kambhampati U.S., The software industry and development: The case of India, Progress in Development Studies, 2, 1, pp. 23-45, (2002); Kapur D., American Universities in a Global Market, (2010); Kumar N., Provincialism in modern India: The multiple narratives of education and their pain, Modern Asian Studies, 40, 2, pp. 397-423, (2006); Ladousa C., Disparate markets: Language, nation, and education in north India, American Ethnologist, 32, 3, pp. 460-478, (2005); Ladousa C., Liberalisation, privatisation, modernisation, and schooling in India: An interview with Krishna Kumar, Globalisation, Societies and Education, 5, 2, pp. 137-152, (2007); Mohammad M., Alsaig A., Alsaig A., Introducing context-awareness to MOOC systems, Proceedings of the 3Rd International Conference on Context-Aware Systems and Applications, pp. 48-56, (2014); Engineers., 2016, (2016); JOSSA Seat Information, (2017); Patibandla M., Petersen B., Role of transnational corporations in the evolution of a high-tech industry: The case of India’s software industry, World Development, 30, 9, pp. 1561-1577, (2002); Statistics Times, (2016); (2016); Rose C.P., Carlson R., Yang D., Wen M., Resnick L., Goldman P., Sherer J., Social Factors that Contribute to Attrition in Moocs.

New data science education programs, which are being launched at an increasing rate, are designed for multiple education levels and populations. Machine learning (ML) is an essential element of data science that requires an extensive background in mathematics. Whereas it is possible to teach the principles of ML only as a black box, novice learners might find it difficult to improve an algorithm’s performance without a white box understanding of the underlying ML algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a pedagogical method, based on hands-on pen-and-paper tasks, to support white box understanding of ML algorithms for learners who lack the level of mathematics knowledge required for this purpose. Data were collected using a comprehension questionnaire and analyzed according to the process-object theory borrowed from mathematics education research. We present evidence of the effectiveness of this method based on data collected in an introduction-level data science course for graduate psychology students. This population had extensive psychology domain knowledge, as well as an established background in statistics, but had gaps in mathematical and computer science knowledge compared with data science majors. The research contribution is both practical and theoretical. Practically, we present a learning module that supports non-major data science students’ white box understanding of ML. Theoretically, we propose a data analysis method to evaluate students’ conceptions of ML algorithms. © 2022","Data science education; Machine learning; Process-object duality theory; Statistics education research","","","","","","MLIS; Technion’s Machine Learning & Intelligent Systems; Tel Aviv University, ТАУ; Technion-Israel Institute of Technology","This work was supported by generous funding from the Technion’s Machine Learning & Intelligent Systems (MLIS) Center.

In this paper, a thorough comparative study between Informatics and Data Science was presented through comparing and investigating the similarities and differences of their curriculum structures, bodies of domain knowledge, technical skill sets, research areas, faculty preparation, student background, as well as the lessons learnt from the development of Informatics programs and challenges in developing Data Science programs. It is believed that the recommendations drawn from this study will assist educators to build their Data Science programs with the confidence and determination but without hesitation and fear of misstepping along the way in promoting and building their new programs. © 2020 IEEE.","Comparative Study; Curriculum Design; Data Science; Informatics; Informatics and Data Science Education","Application programs; Curricula; Informatics; Students; Academic program; Comparative studies; Curriculum development; Curriculum structure; Domain knowledge; Higher education; Science programs; Technical skills; Data Science","","","","","","","Informatics Education: Europe Cannot Afford to Miss the Boat.

In data sciences, there are two related but distinct strategies: hypothesis testing and binary classification. In practice, how to choose between these two strategies can be unclear and rather confusing. Here, we summarize key distinctions between these two strategies in three aspects and list five practical guidelines for data analysts to choose the appropriate strategy for specific analysis needs. We demonstrate the use of those guidelines in a cancer driver gene prediction example. In data science education, two analysis strategies, hypothesis testing and binary classification, are mostly covered in different courses and textbooks. In real data application, it can be puzzling whether a binary decision problem should be formulated as hypothesis testing or binary classification. This article aims to disentangle the puzzle for data science students and researchers by offering practical guidelines for choosing between the two strategies. Hypothesis testing and binary classification are two data analysis strategies taught mostly in different undergraduate classes and rarely compared with each other. As a result, which strategy is more appropriate for a specific real-world data analysis task is often ambiguous. To address this issue, this perspective article clarifies the distinctions between the two strategies and offers practical guidelines to the broad data science discipline. © 2020 The Author(s)","DSML 1: Concept: Basic principles of a new data science output observed and reported","Data handling; Industrial research; Machine learning; Testing; Analysis strategies; Binary classification; Hypothesis testing; Practical guidelines; Science disciplines; Science education; Scientific researches; Statistical hypothesis testing; Data Science","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1846216)","","Lehmann E.L., Romano J.P., Testing Statistical Hypotheses, (2006); Murphy K.P., Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, (2012); Wasserman L., All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, (2013); Distinguishing between two groups in statistics and machine learning: hypothesis test vs. classification vs. clustering, (2016); Why is binary classification not a hypothesis test?, (2016); Liao S.-M., Akritas M., Test-based classification: a linkage between classification and statistical testing, Stat.

However, only scattered studies have shown how learning analytics has been taught more effectively. Meanwhile, there are limited studies on analysing students' motivation, volition and information processing during emergency remote teaching. In the Spring 2022 semester, the author taught a learning analytics course in an ERT situation without any notice in advance. After the semester, the author conducted a retrospective analysis to identify what instructional strategies had been unintentionally adopted, based on an integrated model of motivation, volition and performance proposed by Keller. This manuscript is on the analysis of how instructional strategies had been deployed. Recommended strategies have been proposed for adoption in the future.  © 2022 IEEE.","data science education; emergency remote teaching; learning analytics education; motivation","Education computing; Students; Teaching; Data science education; Emergency remote teaching; Instructional strategy; Integrated modeling; Learning analytic education; Performance; Remote teaching; Retrospective analysis; Science education; Student motivation; Motivation","","","","","","","Lang C., Teasley S., Stamper J., Building the learning analytics curriculum: Workshop, Proceedings of the Seventh International Learning Analytics & Knowledge Conference, (2017); Lang C., Siemens G., Wise A., Gasevic D., Handbook of learning analytics, (2017); LASI-Learning Analytics Summer Institute, (2022); Baker R., Big Data and Education, edX, (2015); McKay T., Practical Learning Analytics; Schneider B., Reilly J., Radu I., Lowering barriers for accessing sensor data in education: Lessons learned from teaching multimodal learning analytics to educators, Journal for STEM Education Research, 3, 1, pp. 91-124, (2020); Ferri F., Grifoni P., Guzzo T., Online learning and emergency remote teaching: Opportunities and challenges in emergency situations, Societies, 10, 4, (2020); Whalen J., Should teachers be trained in emergency remote teaching?

Through analyzing the hosting departments, design principles, curriculum objectives, and curriculum design of existing programs, our findings reveal that (1) the data science field is inherently interdisciplinary and requires joint collaborations between various departments. Multi-department administration was one of the solutions to offer interdisciplinary training, but some problems have also been identified in its practical implementation; (2) data science education should emphasize hands-on practice and experiential learning opportunities to prepare students for data analysis and problem-solving in real-world contexts; and (3) although the importance of comprehensive coverage of various disciplines in data science curricula is widely acknowledged, how to achieve an effective balance between various disciplines and how to effectively integrate domain knowledge into the curriculum still remain open questions. Findings of this study can provide insights for the design and development of emerging undergraduate data science programs. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Curriculum design; Data science education; Interdisciplinarity; Undergraduate","Curricula; Curriculum designs; Design and Development; Experiential learning; Hands-on practice; Interdisciplinary training; Science curriculum; Semi structured interviews; Systematic literature review; Data Science","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation National Natural Science Foundation of China; University of Hong Kong, HKU, (61703357)","Acknowledgments.

Innovation, computation, and technological advances have now tremendously accelerated the pace of discovery, providing driverless cars, robotic devices, expert healthcare systems, precision medicine, and automated discovery to mention a few. Even though the definition of the term data science continues to evolve, the sweeping impact it has already produced on society is undeniable. We are at a point when new discoveries through data science have enormous potential to advance progress but also to be used maliciously, with harmful ethical and social consequences. Perhaps nowhere is this more clearly exemplified than in the biological and medical sciences. The confluence of (1) machine learning, (2) mathematical modeling, (3) computation/simulation, and (4) big data have moved us from the sequencing of genomes to gene editing and individualized medicine; yet, unsettled policies regarding data privacy and ethical norms could potentially open doors for serious negative repercussions. The data science revolution has amplified the urgent need for a paradigm shift in undergraduate biology education. It has reaffirmed that data science education interacts and enhances mathematical education in advancing quantitative conceptual and skill development for the new generation of biologists. These connections encourage us to strive to cultivate a broadly skilled workforce of technologically savvy problem-solvers, skilled at handling the unique challenges pertaining to biological data, and capable of collaborating across various disciplines in the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. To accomplish this, we suggest development of open curricula that extend beyond the job certification rhetoric and combine data acumen with modeling, experimental, and computational methods through engaging projects, while also providing awareness and deep exploration of their societal implications. This process would benefit from embracing the pedagogy of experiential learning and involve students in open-ended explorations derived from authentic inquiries and ongoing research. On this foundation, we encourage development of flexible data science initiatives for the education of life science undergraduates within and across existing models. © 2020, Society for Mathematical Biology.","Big data; Data science education; Education reform; Mathematical biology education","Computational Biology; Curriculum; Data Science; Humans; biology; curriculum; education; human","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (-1300426); National Science Foundation, NSF; University of Tennessee, UT","The first author was partially supported by the Karl Peace Fellowship in Mathematics, Randolph-Macon College, VA.

In this article, we reflect on JSDSE’s relevance to K-12 education and how it might increase its influence in this area. We characterize JSDSE’s K-12 impact partially in terms of its ability to foster statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT). We also introduce a new construct, statistical knowledge for the transformation of teaching (SKT (Formula presented.), to more fully capture the K-12 contributions JSDSE can make. Our analysis draws upon the perspectives of an experienced high school teacher (the first author) and a statistics education researcher (the second author). The first author of the article surveyed recent JSDSE issues to identify and reflect upon articles with implications for his teaching practice. The second author framed the first author’s article reflections in terms of their connections to SKT and SKT2. Drawing upon our collaborative analysis, we propose strategies to help JSDSE more fully realize its potential to contribute to SKT and SKT2. We explain how acting on the proposed strategies may help JSDSE readers, authors, and editors bridge the persistent historical gap between formal scholarship and practice in K-12 education. © 2022 The Author(s).

This has shifted major challenges in biological research from data generation and processing to interpretation and knowledge translation. However, postsecondary training in bioinformatics, or more generally data science for life scientists, lags behind current demand. In particular, development of accessible, undergraduate data science curricula has the potential to improve research and learning outcomes as well as better prepare students in the life sciences to thrive in public and private sector careers. Here, we describe the Experiential Data science for Undergraduate Cross-Disciplinary Education (EDUCE) initiative, which aims to progressively build data science competency across several years of integrated practice. Through EDUCE, students complete data science modules integrated into required and elective courses augmented with coordinated cocurricular activities. The EDUCE initiative draws on a community of practice consisting of teaching assistants (TAs), postdocs, instructors, and research faculty from multiple disciplines to overcome several reported barriers to data science for life scientists, including instructor capacity, student prior knowledge, and relevance to discipline-specific problems. Preliminary survey results indicate that even a single module improves student self-reported interest and/or experience in bioinformatics and computer science. Thus, EDUCE provides a flexible and extensible active learning framework for integration of data science curriculum into undergraduate courses and programs across the life sciences. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

In the world of the 21st century people who are data illiterate, will increasingly find themselves in the same situation, irrespective of their field of employment. Companies and society need people who can analyse data and use the resulting information to direct decisions. Another aspect of the 21st century that society struggles with, is the increasing prevalence of mental illness due to work pressures, failing marriages, torn family structures, isolation and so forth. The mental health of students is a major cause for concern since one in three students show signs of depression and anxiety. Within this context there is a need to develop a plan to address the instructional design for data science students. They need to learn relevant content in a manner that will equip them to succeed in the workplace and society at large within a context where their wellbeing will be nurtured. The study employs the Systems Informed Positive Psychology perspective to direct the process of improving the design of data science modules. Critical Systems Thinking determines how different components are interlinked, and how they can best be changed to attain the overall goal by listening to the voices of all the affected parties. Directed content analysis of comments received from 284 students participating in an introductory statistics module at a South African university indicates that students intuitively mentioned several aspects of the Flourishing Classrooms Systems Model, thereby indicating that students would like a thriving classroom. The students' voice indicated that things like emotional bonding and supportiveness are important to them. Little classroom flexibility is experienced by the students, it may be due to lecturers who are lacking in leadership in the classroom and are unwilling to negotiate on matters with the students. Students indicated the importance of proper classroom communication - clarity and listener skills are crucial for students to flourish in a class. Finally, several aspects of classroom wellbeing were mentioned: strength focus rather than zooming in on shortcomings, lecturers' emotional management, students' increased attention through active learning, improved coping through better planning and time management, and the forming of good study habits. This study shows that by employing systems thinking, the inter-connectedness of diverse factors emerged more clearly, enabling educationists to develop better solutions that may make a difference in the lives of many students. © ISSS 2022.","Data science education; flourishing classroom; positive education; systems informed positive psychology","Data Science; Diseases; Education computing; Systems thinking; Critical systems thinking; Data science education; Flourishing classroom; Mental illness; Positive education; Positive psychology; Science education; System informed positive psychology; Wellbeing; Work pressures; Students","","","","","","","Allison L., Waters L., Kern M.

In the time since, individuals with training in both computing and statistics have become increasingly employable in the burgeoning data science field. In response, universities have developed new courses and programs to meet the growing demand for data science education. To address this demand, we created Data Science in Practice, a large-enrollment undergraduate course. Here, we present our goals for teaching this course, including: (1) conceptualizing data science as creative problem solving, with a focus on project-based learning, (2) prioritizing practical application, teaching and using standardized tools and best practices, and (3) scaling education through coursework that enables hands-on and classroom learning in a large-enrollment course. Throughout this course we also emphasize social context and data ethics to best prepare students for the interdisciplinary and impactful nature of their work. We highlight creative problem solving and strategies for teaching automation-resilient skills, while providing students the opportunity to create a unique data science project that demonstrates their technical and creative capacities. © 2021 The Author(s).

We are beginning to see the impacts of big data in every aspect of our lives and society. We need a science that can address these big data problems. Data science is a new emerging discipline that was termed to address challenges that we are facing and going to face in the big data era. Thus, education in data science is the key to success, and we need concrete strategies and approaches to better educate future data scientists. In this paper, we discuss general concepts on big data, data science, and data scientists and show the results of an extensive survey on current data science education in United States.

As a result of the field's fluidity, there is often a mismatch between what datarelated programs teach, what employers expect, and the actual tasks data scientists are performing. In addition, the tools available to data scientists are not necessarily the tools being taught; textbooks do not seem to meet curricular needs; and empirical evidence does not seem to support existing program design. Currently, the field appears to be bifurcating into data science (DS) and data engineering (DE), with specific but overlapping roles in the combined data science and engineering (DSE) lifecycle. However, curriculum design has not yet caught up to this evolution.

This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Analysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective? Findings: The highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this research are that this study only analyzed research papers in the Web of Science database and therefore only covers a certain amount of scientific papers published in the field of LIS. In addition, only publications with the term “data science” in the topic area of the Web of Science database were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that are not reflected in the Web of Science database or were related to other keywords such as “e-science,” “e-research,” “data service,” “data curation” or “research data management.” Originality/value: The field of data science has not been explored using bibliographic analysis of publications from the perspective of the LIS. This paper helps to better understand the field of data science and the perspectives for information professionals. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliographic analysis; Business value; Data management; Data science; Data scientist; Information science; IoT; Library science; Literature review; Skills","Data Science; Database systems; Internet of things; Knowledge management; Publishing; Bibliographic analysis; Business value; Data scientist; Design/methodology/approach; IoT; Library and information science; Library science; Literature reviews; Skill; Web of Science; Libraries","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Dhar V., Big data, data science, and analytics: the opportunity and challenge for IS research, Information Systems Research, 25, 3, pp. 443-448, (2014); Akerkar R., Sajja P.S., Intelligent Techniques for Data Science, (2016); Amirian P., van Loggerenberg F., Lang T., Data science and analytics, Big Data in Healthcare, SpringerBriefs in Pharmaceutical Science & Drug Development, pp. 15-37, (2017); Antell K., Foote J.B., Turner J., Shults B., Dealing with data: science librarians’ participation in data management at association of research libraries institutions, College & Research Libraries, 75, 4, pp. 557-574, (2014); Aristodemou L., Tietze F., The state-of-the-art on intellectual property analytics (IPA): a literature review on artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning methods for analysing intellectual property (IP) data, World Patent Information, 55, pp. 37-51, (2018); Baskarada S., Koronios A., Unicorn data scientist: the rarest of breeds, Program, 51, 1, pp. 65-74, (2017); Bell G., Hey T., Szalay A., Beyond the data deluge, Science, 323, 5919, pp. 1297-1298, (2009); Bertolucci J., Are you recruiting a data scientist or a unicorn?, (2013); Borgman C.L., Big Data, Little Data, No Data: Scholarship in the Networked World, (2015); Brunner R.J., Kim E.J., Teaching data science, Procedia Computer Science, 80, pp. 1947-1956, (2016); Cady F., The Data Science Handbook, (2017); Cao L., Data Science Thinking: The Next Scientific, Technological and Economic Revolution, (2018); Carter D., Sholler D., Data science on the ground: hype, criticism, and everyday work, Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 67, 10, pp. 2309-2319, (2016); Cervone H.F., Informatics and data science: an overview for the information professional, Digital Library Perspectives, 32, 1, pp. 7-10, (2016); Chatfield A.T., Shlemoon V.N., Redublado W., Rahman F., Data scientists as game changers in big data environments, Proceedings of the 25th Australasian Conference on Information Systems, Auckland University of Technology, pp. 1-11, (2014); Chen C.P., Zhang C.-Y., Data-intensive applications, challenges, techniques and technologies: a survey on big data, Information Sciences, 275, pp. 314-347, (2014); Cleveland W.S., Data science: an action plan for expanding the technical areas of the field of statistics, International Statistical Review, 69, 1, pp. 21-26, (2001); Costa C., Santos M.Y., The data scientist profile and its representativeness in the European e-Competence framework and the skills framework for the information age, International Journal of Information Management, 37, 6, pp. 726-734, (2017); Cukier K., Mayer-Schonberger V., The rise of big data: how it’s changing the way we think about the world, Foreign Affairs, 92, 3, pp. 28-40, (2013); Davenport T.H., Patil D.J., Data scientist: the sexiest job of the 21st century, Harvard Business Review, 90, 5, pp. 70-76, (2012); Demchenko Y., Belloum A., Wiktorski T., EDISON data science framework: part 1.

The demand for novel data science methods is well established. However, there is much less agreement on the core aspects of representation, modeling, and analytics that involve huge and heterogeneous datasets. The scientific community needs to build consensus about data science education and training curricula, including the necessary entry matriculation prerequisites and the expected learning competency outcomes needed to tackle complex Big Data challenges. To meet the rapidly increasing demand for effective evidence-based practice and data analytic methods, research teams, funding agencies, academic institutions, politicians, and industry leaders should embrace innovation, promote high-risk projects, join forces to expand the technological capacity, and enhance the workforce skills. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Artistry; Big data; Data science; Predictive analytics; Qualitative and quantitative skills","Academic institutions; Analytic method; Data challenges; Evidence-based practices; Funding agencies; Heterogeneous datasets; Science education; Scientific community; Data Science","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF;US NSF;USA NSF, (1416953, 1636840, 1734853); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (P20 NR015331, P30 DK089503, P30AG053760, P50 NS091856, U54 EB020406)","","Robinson L., Frank crossley: a man of mettle, JOM, 68, 7, (2016); Weinberger E.D., Fourier and Taylor series on fitness landscapes, Biol.

Modern data driven research and industry require new types of specialists that are capable to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. The education and training of Data Scientists requires multi-disciplinary approach combining wide view of the Data Science and Analytics foundation with deep practical knowledge in domain specific areas. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple form, also providing sufficient data labs facilities for practical training.

Current pedagogy has focused either on data science or on purely analytic technical aspects. There is therefore, an opportunity to rethink how institutions can develop innovative data-focussed education programmes, addressing both modern industry and community demands. As both academia and industry strive to integrate applied learning, transferable and enterprise skills into business and sciences, this paper proposes a design based research approach (DBR) for designing such a new interdisciplinary data science teaching curriculum as a foundation to deliver business undergraduate degrees in Business Data Science. Adopting a design science method our proposed DBR illustrates effective utilities for conceptualising and evaluating a fully functional new degree programme - Bachelor of Business Data Science. Ten senior business information systems academics and five analytics industry practitioners in Victoria, Australia were interviewed in three iterative prototyping phases followed by a final focus group session with business information systems students that evaluated the proposed structure. The findings suggest that proposed DBR ensures the design of an innovative data science degree that may meet growing industry and interdisciplinary demands. The paper concludes by discussing overall feasibility of the proposal in the Australian higher education sector, particularly for the case context of an Australian University. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Business curriculum; Data science education; Higher education; Information systems education","","","","","","Institute for Sustainable Industries and Liveable Cities; Victoria University, VU"," This work was supported by a Fellowship Programme 2019 (ethical approval ref.: HRE18-184) under the Institute for Sustainable Industries and Liveable Cities, Victoria University, Melbourne.

Methods and Materials: The features of two online data science platforms are outlined. Both are useful for new data projects and both are integrated with common programming languages used for data analysis. One platform focuses more on data exploration and the other focuses on containerizing, visualization, and sharing code repositories. Results: Both data science platforms are open, free, and allow for collaboration. Both are capable of visual, descriptive, and predictive analytics Discussion: Data science education benefits by having affordable open and collaborative platforms to conduct a variety of data analyses. Conclusion: Open collaborative data science platforms are particularly useful for teaching data science skills to clinical and nonclinical informatics students. Commercial data science platforms exist but are cost-prohibitive and generally limited to specific programming languages. © The Author(s) 2018.

This paper reports on a design study in which diverse middle and high school youth in a free summer workshop at an urban public library were asked to model their family geobiographies, or their personal family migration stories, with socioeconomic LSDS. Youth represented family decision-making and social conditions that might have motivated family movements with online, dynamic data modeling and mapping tools (Gapminder.org; SocialExplorer.com). The qualitative video analysis examined participants’ experiences and learning in storytelling and modeling the family geobiography, focusing on multimodal talk-in-interaction to understand how the study design engaged learners’ capacities, histories, and imagined futures in relation to the LSDS and supported learning about oneself and society. Grounded examples from two family cases are used to illustrate how participants placed their families and selves into data ontologies and the role of family members in composing storylines. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1341882)","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant #1341882.","Axelrod D., Kahn J., Intergenerational family storytelling and modeling with large-scale data sets, Proceedings of the 18th ACM International Conference on Interaction Design and Children, pp. 352-360, (2019);

Data science is not an exception. In recent years scientists were concerned about a large number of irreproducible studies. Such reproducibility crisis in science could severely undermine public trust in science and science-based public policy. Recent efforts to promote reproducible research mainly focused on matured scientists and much less on student training. In this study, we conducted action research on students in data science to evaluate to what extent students are ready for communicating reproducible data analysis. The results show that although two-thirds of the students claimed they were able to reproduce results in peer reports, only one-third of reports provided all necessary information for replication. The actual replication results also include conflicting claims; some lacked comparisons of original and replication results, indicating that some students did not share a consistent understanding of what reproducibility means and how to report replication results. The findings suggest that more training is needed to help data science students communicating reproducible data analysis. © 2019 Chinese Academy of Sciences Published under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)","Action research; Communication; Data science education; Reproducibility; Reproducible data analysis","Data Science; Students; Action research; Data science education; Public trust; Reproducibilities; Reproducible data analyse; Reproducible research; Science education; Scientific researches; Student training; Data handling","","","","","","","Providing new incentives to foster open science and increase reproducibility, (2014); King G., Publication, publication, PS: Political Science and Politics, 39, 1, pp. 119-125, (2006); 1500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility, (2016); Kaiser J., Rigorous replication effort succeeds for just two of five cancer papers; Dewald W.G., Thursby G.J., Anderson R.G., Replication in empirical economics: The Journal of Money, Credit and Banking project, The American Economic Review, 76, 4, pp. 587-603, (1986); Peng R.D., Dominici F., Zeger S.L., Reproducible epidemiologic research, American Journal of Epidemiology, 163, 9, pp. 783-789, (2006); Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science, Science, 349, 6251, (2015); Peng R.D., Reproducible research in computational science, Science, 334, 6060, pp. 1226-1227, (2011); King G., Replication, replication, PS: Political Science and Politics, 28, 3, pp. 444-452, (1955); Donoho D.L., An invitation to reproducible computational research, Biostatistics, 11, 3, pp. 385-388, (2010); Stodden V., Miguez S., Best practices for computational science: Software infrastructure and environments for reproducible and extensible research, Journal of Open Research Software, 2, 1, (2004); Howe B., Communicating data science results, MOOC course on Coursera; Peng R., Disseminating reproducible research is fundamentally a language and communication problem; Gentleman R., Lang D.T., Statistical analyses and reproducible research, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 16, 1, pp. 1-23, (2012); Knuth D.E., Literate programming, The Computer Journal, 27, 2, pp. 97-111, (1984); Dnuggets K., Python eats away at R: Top software for analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning in 2018: Trends and Analysis; Gandrud C., Reproducible research with R and R studio, (2013); How to create a minimal, complete, and verifiable example – help center – stack overflow; Stringer E.T., Action research in education, (2008); Cohen J., A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20, pp. 37-46, (1960)","X.

To realize the potential of big data in biomedicine, the National Institutes of Health launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative, funding several centers of excellence in biomedical data analysis and a Training Coordinating Center (TCC) tasked with facilitating online and in-person training of biomedical researchers in data science. A major initiative of the BD2K TCC is to automatically identify, describe, and organize data science training resources available on the Web and provide personalized training paths for users. In this paper, we describe the construction of ERuDIte, the Educational Resource Discovery Index for Data Science, and its release as linked data. ERuDIte contains over 11,000 training resources including courses, video tutorials, conference talks, and other materials. The metadata for these resources is described uniformly using Schema.org. We use machine learning techniques to tag each resource with concepts from the Data Science Education Ontology, which we developed to further describe resource content. Finally, we map references to people and organizations in learning resources to entities in DBpedia, DBLP, and ORCID, embedding our collection in the web of linked data. We hope that ERuDIte will provide a framework to foster open linked educational resources on the Web. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

However, currently, data science educators lack good tools and methodologies. In particular, they lack integrated tools through which their students can acquire hands-on software engineering experience. To address these problems, we designed and implemented DataLab, a web-based tool for data science education that integrates code, data and execution management into one system. The goal of DataLab is to provide a hands-on online lab environment to train students to have basic software engineering thinking and habits while maintaining a focus on the core data science contents. In this paper, we present the user-experience design and system-level implementation of DataLab. Further, we evaluate DataLab's performance through an in-classroom use case. Finally, using objective log-based learning behavior analysis and a subjective survey, we demonstrate DataLab's effectiveness. © 2017 IEEE.","data science; software engineering","Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Information management; Students; data science; Execution management; Integrated tools; Learning behavior; Science education; System levels; User experience design; Web-based tools; Software engineering","","","","","","","White T., Hadoop: The Definitive Guide[ M, (2012); Zaharia M., Chowdhury M., Das T., Et al., Resilient distributed datasets: A fault-Tolerant abstraction for in-memory cluster computing[ c, Proceedings of the 9th USENIX Conference on Networked Systems Design and Implementation, (2012); Isard M., Budiu M., Yu Y., Et al., Dryad: Distributed data-parallel programs from sequential building blocks[ c, ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review.

Furthermore, the relevant state-of-the-art is revisited and remaining challenges are identified. An exemplar set of use cases, corresponding user stereotypes as well as a conceptual design model to address these challenges are introduced. A corresponding architectural system model is suggested as a conceptual reference architecture to support proof-of-concept implementations as well as to support interoperability in distributed infrastructures.

This is due to several good reasons. Probably an important one of those reasons is the growing demand to find proper ways to face the challenges of establishing data-driven economies and societies. As academics and educationalists, but also Data Science professionals, we look at how to bring up this kind of specialists such that to meet the current shortages but also mid-term demands. In this position paper we deliberate about how to architect thematically, didactically, and organizationally a university program under the thematic umbrella of Data Science. We focus on the selection of learning units or disciplines to be covered in order to produce the M.Sci. and Ph.D. graduates who will be ready to face the future challenges in the mid-term perspective. We outline our recommendation on using learning tools and materials. We also concisely present the approach for stimulating competitive and cooperative atmosphere in the class that stimulates intensive collective and individual learning. We recommend to reinforce an academic program by involving industrial partners intensively in the process. We ground our deliberation on our experience in implementing relevant M.Sci. and Ph.D. programs in Data Science and Semantic Technologies. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Collaboration with industries; Data science education; Didactics; Learning tools; Program structure; Topical scope","Knowledge management; Semantics; Collaboration with industries; Didactics; Learning tool; Program structures; Science education; Topical scope; Industrial research","","","","","Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme, (PIRSES-GA-2013-612551); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","This work has been done in cooperation between the authors which has been kicked off in the EU FP7 SemData project funded by Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme, grant agreement No PIRSES-GA-2013-612551.

Many scientific graduate degree programs expect students to acquire these computational skills in an applied statistics course. A gap remains, however, between the computational skills required for the implementation of statistics in scientific research and those taught in statistics courses. This qualitative study examines how five environmental science graduate students at one institution experience the phenomenon of acquiring the computational skills necessary to implement statistics in their research and the factors that foster or inhibit learning. In-depth interviews revealed three themes in these students' paths towards computational knowledge acquisition: use of peer support, seeking out a singular ""consultant, "" and learning through independent research experiences. These themes provide rich descriptions of graduate student experiences and strategies used while developing computational skills to apply statistics in their own research, thus informing how to improve instruction, both in and out of the formal classroom. © International Association for Statistical Education (IASE/ISI), November, 2019.","Data science education; Environmental sciences; Statistics education research","","","","","","","","Andelman S.J., Bowles C.M., Willig M.R., Waide R.B., Understanding environmental complexity through a distributed knowledge network, BioScience, 54, 3, pp. 240-246, (2004); Cobb G., Mere renovation is too little too late: We need to rethink our undergraduate curriculum from the ground up, The American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 266-282, (2015); Cortina T., An introduction to computer science for non-majors using principles of computation, Proceedings of the 38th SIGCSE technical symposium on computer science education, pp. 218-222, (2007); Creswell J., Qualitative inquiry and research design: Choosing among five approaches, (2007); Fox J.A., Ouellette B.F., Education in computational biology today and tomorrow.

Scientists, engineers, and executives routinely encounter enormous volumes of data, and new techniques and tools are emerging to create knowledge out of these data, some of them capable of working with real-time streams of data. The nation's ability to make use of these data depends on the availability of an educated workforce with necessary expertise. With these new capabilities have come novel ethical challenges regarding the effectiveness and appropriateness of broad applications of data analyses. The field of data science has emerged to address the proliferation of data and the need to manage and understand it. Data science is a hybrid of multiple disciplines and skill sets, draws on diverse fields (including computer science, statistics, and mathematics), encompasses topics in ethics and privacy, and depends on specifics of the domains to which it is applied. Fueled by the explosion of data, jobs that involve data science have proliferated and an array of data science programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels have been established. Nevertheless, data science is still in its infancy, which suggests the importance of envisioning what the field might look like in the future and what key steps can be taken now to move data science education in that direction. This study will set forth a vision for the emerging discipline of data science at the undergraduate level. This interim report lays out some of the information and comments that the committee has gathered and heard during the first half of its study, offers perspectives on the current state of data science education, and poses some questions that may shape the way data science education evolves in the future. The study will conclude in early 2018 with a final report that lays out a vision for future data science education. © 2018 by the National Academy of Sciences.

The authors use data from elementary science methods students enrolled in a senior-level, semester-length course. Acting as judges, students used the 23-item Elementary Science Teaching Analysis Matrix (ESTAM) instrument to evaluate five separate science lessons taught by five different teachers. Our MFRM analysis documents that multiple judges need not act as identical robots. Rather, differences in judges' severity can be computed and corrections made in an analysis to take into consideration differing judge severity.

In this paper, we explore the applications of Smart Blockchain Badges on data science education. In particular, we investigate how Smart Blockchain Badges can support learners that want to advance their careers in data science, by offering them personalised recommendations based on their learning achievements. This work aims at enhancing data science accreditation by introducing a robust system based on the Blockchain technology. Learners will benefit from a sophisticated, open and transparent accreditation system, as well as from receiving job recommendations that match their skills and can potentially progress their careers. As a result, this work contributes towards closing the data science skills gap by linking data science education to the industry. © 2018 IEEE.","Accreditation; Blockchain; Data Science; Open Badges; Smart Blockchain Badges","Blockchain; Data Science; Learning systems; Block-chain; Learning achievement; Open badge; Personalized recommendation; Robust systems; Science education; Skills gaps; Smart blockchain badge; Accreditation","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (643937, 688095)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 643937 (EDSA) and No 688095 (SlideWiki).","Davenport T.H., Patil D., Data scientist: The sexiest job of the 21st century, Harvard Business Review, (2012); James M., Michael C., Brad B., Jacques B., Richard D., Charles R., Angela H., Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity, The McKinsey Global Institute, (2011); Glick B., Government calls for more data scientists in the UK, Computer Weekly, (2013); McKenna B., Demand for big data IT workers to double by 2017 says eSkills, Computer Weekly, (2012); Dadzie A.-S., Sibarani E., Novalija I., Scerri S., Structuring visual exploratory analysis of skill demand, Journal of Web Semantics, (2017); Open Badges for Lifelong Learning, (2010); Belshaw D., The Three Biggest (Perceived) Problems with Open Badges [Blog Post], (2015); Hickey D.T., Willis J., Quick J., Where badges work better, Educause Learning Initiative ELI, (2015); Clack C.D., Bakshi V.A., Braine L., Smart Contract Templates: Foundations, Design Landscape and Research Directions, (2016); Buterin V., Ethereum white paper, GitHub Repository, (2013); Thomas H., Qiu T., Continuing professional development: Accountability, autonomy, efficiency and equity in five professions, British Journal of Educational Studies, 61, pp. 161-186, (2013); Berners-Lee T., Linked Data-Design Issues, (2006)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), Educational Research Methods (ERM) Division; IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Education Society; SJSU Charles W.

Unlike these disciplines, however, data science education remains heavily focused on theory and methods, and practical coursework typically revolves around cleaned or simplified data sets that have little analog in professional applications. We believe that the environment in which new data scientists are trained should more accurately reflect that in which they will eventually practice, and we propose here a data science master's degree program that takes inspiration from the residency model used in medicine. Students in the suggested program would spend their time working on a practical problem with an industry, government, or nonprofit partner, supplemented with coursework in data science methods and theory. We also discuss how this program can also be implemented in shorter formats to augment existing professional master's programs in different disciplines. This approach to learning by doing is designed to fill gaps in our current approach to data science education and ensure that students develop the skills they need to practice data science in a professional context and under the many constraints imposed by that context. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.","curriculum; data science; data science competencies; education; training","Curriculum; Data Science; Education, Graduate; Ethics, Professional; academic achievement; curriculum; education; medical ethics; organization and management","","","","","Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Yale School of Medicine, CORE","For many of the skill domains described above, classroom-based coursework is an inefficient and ineffective method of building student competency.

Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers. Based on our results, we conclude that hack weeks present an effective, easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to positively impact data analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster collaboration, and cultivate best practices. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

For example, developing curricula and models for managing faculty resources (full-time teaching, buy-out, or specialized faculty) are some initial, common challenges. Participants will present their experiences and insights regarding data science education, which may include curricula, barriers, and best practices in the panel presentations. The panel session then will open up to an active discussion session with the audience, who will be encouraged to share their experiences and insights. This panel session is part of an ongoing effort by the organizers to establish sustainable data science education in Information Science schools. Developing a framework and curricula of data science education in Information Science schools, based on best practices and informed by experience, is the optimal goal of this ongoing effort.

The project focuses on advanced data analytics (ADA) in business management. In the project, advanced data analytics is taught to both students at University of Eastern Finland and to their potential employers at the local organizations. The university teaching favors effective teaching techniques instead of conventional teaching methods, and the same topics are taught to participants from local organizations as shorter versions. The organizations also have an important role in calibrating the teaching via discussions and maturity reviews.

With elementary school age children as the target audience, we developed an educational collaborative game, Habitat Explorer for the MultiTaction display to introduce users to the core data science cycle components of data collection, exploration, and visualization. Users capture ""sea creatures"" in a collection jar, sort their collection into a data table, and then are able to create a bar chart visualization using their data. These components are interspersed with questions assessing user comprehension of the simple biological and data science concepts introduced during the game. The main goal of this research is to understand the potential of multi-touch displays to facilitate data science education with future aims to develop more complicated data exploration applications.

Data Science education programs are rapidly being created on all levels. Usually it happens through reuse or renaming and can result in curricula that lack proper balance of competences, which balance is necessary for future data scientists. Our quantitative analysis of over 300 programs worldwide shows that at least one of the three core data science competence groups is under-represented in the majority of programs. Moreover, general business courses are often suggested to students to cover the domain competence group, which in most cases results in superficial treatment of this competence group. Our further qualitative analysis demonstrates that learning outcomes for most of the courses are usually not defined or defined improperly. © 2016 IEEE.","","Cloud computing; Curricula; Data Analytics; Business course; Learning outcome; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative and qualitative analysis; Science education; Science programs; Superficial treatments; Under-represented; Data Science","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (675419)","","College & University DataScience Degrees; Building the Data Science Profession; Manieri A., Et al., Data Science Professional Uncovered: How the EDISON Project Will Contribute to A Widely Accepted Profile for Data Scientists, pp. 588-593, (2015); Demchenko, Et al., Deliverable D2.1-Data Scientist Competences, and Skills Framework (CF-DS), and BoK Definition, (2016); Wlodarczyk T.W., Hacker T.J., Problembased learning approach to a course in data intensive systems, Cloud Computing Technology, and Science, pp. 942-948, (2014)","T.

However, data science education is not currently a graduation requirement at most colleges and universities. As a result, many graduates lack even basic knowledge of data science. To address the shortfall, academic institutions should incorporate introductory data science into general education courses. A general education IT course provides a unique opportunity to integrate data science education. Modules covering databases, spreadsheets, and presentation software, already present in many survey IT courses, teach concepts and skills needed for data science. As a result, a survey IT course can provide comprehensive introductory data science education by adding a data science module focused on modeling and evaluation, two key steps in the data science process. The module should use data science software for application, avoiding the complexities of programming and advanced math, while enabling an emphasis on conceptual understanding. We implemented a course built around these ideas and found that the course helps develop data savvy in students. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","CRISP-DM; Data Mining; Data Visualization; Database; Information Technology Education; Introductory Data Science","Application programs; Curricula; Data mining; Data Science; Database systems; Surveys; Academic institutions; Colleges and universities; Conceptual understanding; CRISP-DM; General education; Information technology education; National academies; Science education; Data visualization","","","","","","","Anderson P., Bowring J., McCauley R., Pothering G., Starr C., An undergraduate degree in data science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience, Proceedings of the 45th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 145-150, (2014); Baumer B., A data science course for undergraduates: Thinking with data, The American Statistician, 69, 4, pp. 334-342, (2015); Bonilla C., Not A Data Scientist?

It is essential they learn by working on assignments that involve real world data sets to develop the skills needed to be successful in the workplace. However, enabling instructors to flexibly deliver all kinds of data science assignments using real world data sets to large numbers of learners (both on-campus and off-campus) at low cost is a significant open challenge. To address this emerging challenge generally, we develop and deploy a novel Cloud-based Lab for Data Science (CLaDS) to enable many learners around the world to work on real-world data science problems without having to move or otherwise distribute prohibitively large data sets. Leveraging version control and continuous integration, CLaDS provides a general infrastructure to enable any instructor to conveniently deliver any hands-on data science assignment that uses large real world data sets to as many learners as our cloud-computing infrastructure allows at very low cost. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CLaDS and discuss our experience with using CLaDS to deploy seven major text data assignments for students in both an on-campus course and an online course to work on for learning about text data retrieval and mining techniques; this shows that CLaDS is a very promising novel general infrastructure for efficiently delivering a wide range of hands-on data science assignments to a large number of learners at very low cost. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Cloud computing; Data science education; Virtual lab","Cloud computing; Costs; Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Engineering education; Engineering research; Virtual reality; Cloud computing infrastructures; Continuous integrations; Design and implementations; Mining techniques; Science education; Scientists and engineers; Version control; Virtual lab; Big data","","","","","Gulf Research Program, (IIS-1629161); National Science Foundation, NSF, (DGE-1144245)","This material is based upon work supported by the NSF GRFP under Grant Number DGE-1144245, by the NSF Research Program under Grant Number IIS-1629161, by Microsoft Azure, and by a gift fund from Intel under its support program for Big Data Education.","Beck K., Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, (2000); Eisenstein J., O'Connor B., Smith N.A., Xing E.P., A latent variable model for geographic lexical variation, Proc.

One promising phenomenon investigated in related work is perspective-taking. A first-person “actor” perspective can help facilitate group and individual sensemaking by mediating observations and actions taken by learners. Here we investigate how museum visitors made use of an actor perspective when exploring an open-ended, interactive data map museum exhibit. We use a mix of qualitative and quantitative empirical methods to explore how actor perspective-taking (APT) may mediate joint sensemaking around data visualizations. By applying interpretive coding to 54 conversations wherein APT naturalistically emerged, we identify 3 distinct self-to-data relationships constructed via APT: role-play, projection, and orientation. A further analysis explores how APT was embedded in joint sensemaking of the visualized data. Twelve APT-mediated sensemaking processes are identified; two (extrapolating and noticing absence) were used in conjunction with multiple APT self-to-data relationships, while the remaining ten (e.g., enacting, spatially characterizing, generalizing) were exclusively used with specific self-to-data APT relationships. We use these empirical findings to generate hypotheses about how APT and associated sensemaking processes may support Data Science learning goals. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1248052);

The anecdotal evidence suggests this was a mistake: data scientists report spending most of their time grappling with data far upstream of modeling activities. A second wave of data science education is emerging, one with increased emphasis on practical issues in ethics, legal compliance, scientific reproducibility, data quality, and algorithmic bias. The data engineering community has a second chance to influence these programs beyond just providing a set of tools. In this panel, we'll discuss the role of data engineering in data science education programs, and how best to capitalize on emerging opportunities in this space. © 2017 IEEE.","","Education; Anecdotal evidences; Data engineering; Legal compliance; Practical issues; Reproducibilities; Scalable algorithms; Science education; Statistical modeling; Information management","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","33rd IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, ICDE 2017","19 April 2017 through 22 April 2017","San Diego","127836","10844627","978-150906543-1","","","English","Proc Int Conf Data Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021187717"

I conjecture that data science could provide students with an opportunity to use computing to better understand their social world, while also allowing students to draw from and make sense of their own experiences. I plan to explore this idea by enhancing and evaluating a software tool, Local Ground, and creating a curriculum that helps young people identify and describe salient characteristics of their lived realities, moving from unstructured to structured data representations (e.g., photos to tags to databases). This process may generate a rich, motivating data source to explore subsequent ideas in computational thinking and social science.","Broadening participation; Computational thinking; Data science education; Interdisciplinary approaches","Curricula; Education; Social sciences; Broadening participation; Computational thinkings; Inquiry-based learning; Interdisciplinary approaches; Science education; Structured data; Support learning; Young peoples; Students","","","","","","","Bort H., Czarnik M., Brylow D., Introducing computing concepts to non-majors: A case study in gothic novels, Proceedings of the 46th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE '15), pp. 132-137, (2015); DiSalvo B., Guzdail M., Glitch game testers: African amencan men breaking open the console, Digital Games Research Association Conference, pp. 1-7, (2009); Edelson D.C., Gordin D.N., Pea R.D., Addressing the challenges of inquiry-based learning through technology and curriculum design, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 8, 3-4, pp. 391-450, (1999); Goode J., Margolis J., Exploring computer science, ACM Transactions on Computing Education, 11, 2, pp. 1-16, (2011); Gutierrez K.D., Vossoughi S., Lifting off the ground to return anew: Mediated praxis, transformative learning, and social design experiments, Journal of Teacher Education, 61, pp. 100-117, (2010); Lee C., Culture Literacy and Learning, (2007); Philip T.M., Way W., Garcia A.D., Schuler-Brown S., Navarro O., When educators attempt to make ""community"" a part of classroom learning: Thedangers of (mis) appropriating students' communities into schools, Teaching and Teacher Education, 34, pp. 174-183, (2013); Plaue C., Cook L.R., Data journalism: Lessons learned while designing an interdisciplinary service course, Proceedings of the 46th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE '15), pp. 126-131, (2015); Van Wart S., Tsai K.J., Parikh T., Local ground: A paper-based toolkit for documenting local geo-spatial knowledge, Proceedings of the First ACM Symposium on Computing for Development, (2010)","S.

These new trends impact the society and future jobs, and thus student careers. At the heart of this digital transformation is data science, the discipline that makes sense of big data. With many rapidly emerging digital challenges ahead of us, this article discusses perspectives on iSchools' opportunities and suggestions in data science education. We argue that iSchools should empower their students with ""information computing""disciplines, which we define as the ability to solve problems and create values, information, and knowledge using tools in application domains. As specific approaches to enforcing information computing disciplines in data science education, we suggest the three foci of user-based, tool-based, and application-based. These three foci will serve to differentiate the data science education of iSchools from that of computer science or business schools. We present a layered Data Science Education Framework (DSEF) with building blocks that include the three pillars of data science (people, technology, and data), computational thinking, data-driven paradigms, and data science lifecycles. Data science courses built on the top of this framework should thus be executed with user-based, tool-based, and application-based approaches. This framework will help our students think about data science problems from the big picture perspective and foster appropriate problem-solving skills in conjunction with broad perspectives of data science lifecycles. We hope the DSEF discussed in this article will help fellow iSchools in their design of new data science curricula.  © 2017 Il-Yeol Song & Yongjun Zhu.","Big data; Computational thinking; Data science; Data science lifecycle; Data-driven paradigm; Information computing; iSchool; The fourth Industrial Revolution","","","","","","","","Baweja B., Donovan P., Haefele M., Siddiqi L., Smiles S., Extreme automation and connectivity: The global, regional, and investment implications of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, UBS White Paper for the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2016, (2016); Bundy A., Computational thinking is pervasive, Journal of Scientific and Practical Computing, 1, 2, pp. 67-69, (2007); Davenport T.H., Patil D.J., Data scientist: The sexiest job of the 21st century, Harvard Business Review, 90, 10, pp. 70-76, (2012); Dhar V., Data science and prediction, Communications of the ACM, 56, 12, pp. 64-73, (2013); Organizing for Big Data Through Better Process and Governance., (2016); Kagermann H., Helbig J., Hellinger A., Wahlster W., Recommendations for Implementing the Strategic Initiative Industrie 4.0: Securing the Future of the German Manufacturing Industry; Final Report of the Industrie 4.0 Working Group., (2013); Lasi H., Fettke P., Kemper H., Feld T., Hoffmann M., Industry 4.0, Business & Information Systems Engineering, 6, 4, pp. 239-242, (2014); Mayer-Schonberger V., Cukier K., Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think, (2013); Provost F., Fawcett T., Data science and its relationship to big data and data-driven decision making, Big Data, 1, 1, pp. 51-59, (2013); Schwab K., The fourth industrial revolution: What it means, how to respond, World Economic Forum., (2016); Stanton J., An Introduction to Data Science., (2012); Song I.-Y., Zhu Y., Big data and data science: What should we teach?, Expert Systems, 33, 4, pp. 364-373, (2016); Storey V., Song I.-Y., Big data technologies and management: What conceptual modeling can do?, Data & Knowledge Engineering, 108, pp. 50-67, (2017); Wing J.M., Computational thinking, Communications of the ACM, 49, 3, pp. 33-35, (2006); Wing J.M., Computational thinking and thinking about computing, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 366, 1881, pp. 3717-3725, (2008); Zhu Y., Yan E., Song M., Understanding the evolving academic landscape of library and information science through faculty hiring data, Scientometrics, 108, 3, pp. 1461-1478, (2016)","I.-Y.

In this paper, we present, 'Milo', a web-based visual programming environment for Data Science Education, designed as a pedagogical tool that can be used by students without prior-programming experience. To that end, Milo uses graphical blocks as abstractions of language specific implementations of Data Science and Machine Learning(ML) concepts along with creation of interactive visualizations. Using block definitions created by a user, Milo generates equivalent source code in JavaScript to run entirely in the browser. Based on a preliminary user study with a focus group of undergraduate computer science students, Milo succeeds as an effective tool for novice learners in the field of Data Science. © 2018 IEEE.","","Learning systems; Students; Visualization; Computer science students; Equivalent source; Graphical blocks; Interactive visualizations; Pedagogical tools; Programming experience; Science education; Visual programming environments; Visual languages","","","","","","","Linkedin's 2017 U.s.

Many people who currently teach data science are practitioners such as computational researchers in academia or data scientists in industry. To understand how these practitioner-instructors pass their knowledge onto novices and how that contrasts with teaching more traditional forms of programming, we interviewed 20 data scientists who teach in settings ranging from small-group workshops to large online courses. We found that: 1) they must empathize with a diverse array of student backgrounds and expectations, 2) they teach technical workflows that integrate authentic practices surrounding code, data, and communication, 3) they face challenges involving authenticity versus abstraction in software setup, finding and curating pedagogically-relevant datasets, and acclimating students to live with uncertainty in data analysis. These findings can point the way toward better tools for data science education and help bring data literacy to more people around the world. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Data science education; Teaching programming","Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Students; Uncertainty analysis; Group workshops; Online course; Science education; Teaching programming; Work-flows; Data Science","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Education and Human Resources, EHR, (1735234); National Science Foundation, NSF","Thanks to the UC San Diego Design Lab, rOpenSci, Elissa Redmiles, and Os Keyes for their feedback, and NSF award #1735234 for funding.","The 50 Most Popular MOOCs of All Time, (2017); The Complete List of Data Science Bootcamps & Fellowships, (2017); Project Jupyter, (2017); Data Carpentry: Building Communities Teaching Universal Data Literacy, (2018); DataCamp: Learn R, Python & Data Science Online, (2018); Dataquest: Learn Data Science with Python and R Projects, (2018); Ggplot2 Is A System for Declaratively Creating Graphics, Based on the Grammar of Graphics, (2018); JupyterHub: A Multi-User Version of the Notebook Designed for Companies, Classrooms and Research Labs, (2018); R Markdown: Analyze.

Hence, it is necessary to design efficient education techniques to rapidly train the next generation of students. We describe a holistic approach that integrates multiple objectives within a single semester course taught at the first year level. The objectives include basic data processing techniques, statistical analysis, teamwork, and project management. We conducted a project that combined different public datasets related to the cost and quality of education in the US. Students demonstrated a high degree of involvement in this exercise as they were curious to explore data that related to their own college selection process. It is well known that it is difficult to perform a cost-quality analysis in the field of college education.We used college ranking data created by the Wall Street Journal, and combined it with data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System database (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) that provided college costs and graduation data. Students worked in teams to download sections of the data from multiple sources, performed cleaning and verification, and merged the data for analysis. This taught them the values of teamwork, goal-setting, and process measurement for timely project completion.We determined that the Pearson correlation between the rank of a college and in-state tuition was-0.65 (p<0.005) for private colleges, and-0.34 (p<0.005) for public colleges. This indicates that higher ranked colleges tend to charge higher tuition. The Pearson correlation between the rank of all colleges and their graduation rates is-0.75 (p<0.005), and between rank and retention rates is-0.71 (p<0.005). Private college tuition is typically $40,000 annually, whereas public colleges cost $20,000. These figures suggest that public colleges provide good value. This has policy implications for government funding of education. © 2019 IEEE.","curricular development; data science; project management; statistical analysis","Correlation methods; Cost benefit analysis;

Modern data driven research and industry require new types of specialists that are capable to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. The education and training of Data Scientists currently lacks a commonly accepted, harmonized instructional model that reflects all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science practitioners in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. The educational model and approach should also solve different aspects of the future professionals that includes both theoretical knowledge and practical skills that must be supported by corresponding education infrastructure and educational labs environment. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple form, also providing sufficient data labs facilities for practical training. This paper discussed both aspects: building customizable Data Science curriculum for different types of learners and proposing a hybrid model for virtual labs that can combine local university facility and use cloud based Big Data and Data analytics facilities and services on demand.

In this study we present initial results from an ongoing qualitative study of an interdisciplinary cyberinfrastructure-focused NSF-funded graduate data science education workshop hosted at an iSchool in the US. The complexity of the workshop curriculum, the participants’ and instructors’ disparate disciplinary backgrounds, and the technical tools employed are particularly suited to qualitative methods which can synthesize all of these aspects from rich observational, ethnographic, and trace data collected as part of the authors’ role on the grant’s qualitative evaluation team. The success of the workshop in equipping participants to do reproducible computational science was in part due to the successful acculturation process, whereby participants comprehended, altered, and enacted new norms amongst themselves. At the same time, we observed potential challenges for data science instruction resulting from the rhetorical framing of the technologies as inescapably new. This language, which mirrors that of a successful grant proposal, tends to obscure the deeply embedded and contingent history of the command-line technologies required to preform computational science, many of which are decades old. We conclude by describing our ongoing work, future theoretical sampling plans from this and future data, and the contributions that our findings can provide to graduate data science curriculum development and pedagogy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Data science education; Grounded theory; Temporality","Curricula; Computational science; Cyber infrastructures; Graduate education; Qualitative evaluations; Qualitative method; Science curriculum; Science education; Science instructions; Data Science","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1730390); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work was partially supported by National Science Foundation grant 1730390.","Adolph S., Hall W., Kruchten P., Using grounded theory to study the experience of software development, Empir.

The growing field of data science has the potential to address many of these needs, primarily due to recent efforts to collect large amounts of data related to social, environmental, and political issues. A challenge is that there exists a disconnect between these real-world issues and the course materials taught to university students. This gap is due in part to a lack of engagement between universities and their local communities, leaving students with few opportunities to work with datasets relevant to real-world problems. To address this disconnect, the authors have implemented a novel data science education and outreach program in which students acquire new knowledge and skills while creating positive social impact through community service. In this work, we outline this outreach program, the Michigan Data Science Team, and provide empirical evidence of positive educational and social impact. © 2018 IEEE.","Collaborative Learning; Data Science Education; Service-Learning; Social Impact","Economic and social effects; Collaborative learning; Community services; Large amounts of data; Real-world problem; Science education; Service learning; Social impact; University students; Students","","","","","Horace H.

For these purposes, the authors explore features of digital media artefacts which are specific to data expeditions and are essential to accurate evaluation. The rubrics as a power but hardly formalizable evaluation method in application to digital media artefacts are also discussed. Moreover, the paper documents the experience of rubrics creation according to the suggested framework. The rubrics were successfully adopted to two data-driven journalism courses.

At first, only HSE-students of the first-year “Data Journalism” master program was involved into this activity. At second, the participation was obligatory because the DE acted as an assessment after several modules of the Scientific Research Seminar, “Open data” and “Introductory programming” courses. This explains by that the DE was targeted to evaluate complex skills in data-driven journalism which should have been shaped by the end of the first year of education. At third, DE was preceded by short in-class session where students divided into working teams and took part in discussion on evaluation rubrics. At fourth, collaboration between participants and administrators was supported by Microsoft Office 365 Education (using OneNote Class Notebook [24]).","(2013); (2017); Anderson P., Nash T., McCauley R., Faciliatating programming success in data science courses through gamified scafollding and Learn2Mine, Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, (2015); Jormanainen I., Sutinen E., An open approach for learning educational data mining, Koli Calling’13, Koli, (2013); Bhargava R., Deahl E., Letouze E., Noonan A., Sangokoya D., Shoup N., Beyond Data Literacy: Reinventing Community Engagement and Empowerment in the Age of Data (2015); Data Expeditions; Radchenko I., Sakoyan A., On Some Russian Educational Projects in Open Data and Data Journalism.

It is forecast that 75% of enterprise applications will use AI, Machine Learning or Deep Learning technology by 2021, yet university programs commonly place the burden on students to obtain their data science educations through elective coursework spanning multiple disparate departments. Data science requires specific mathematics preparation especially for cybersecurity students whose programs have reduced the requirements for advance mathematics to a bare minimum. To facilitate curricula preparation, and hands-on usage of AI tools, a notebook ('A Trellis For Novice AI Practitioners') was prepared in the R programming language as a first step in introducing computer science and cybersecurity students to the concepts and capabilities of AI. A focus on an intrusion detection data set to mitigate nine common cyber vulnerabilities is used in this analysis. Trellis bridges the theoretical and practical chasm for students by building an ANN network intrusion predictive model from scratch. It serves as a template but also encourages heavy contextual modification, and may be relied upon in the beginning stages of a cybersecurity practitioner's data science activities on a wide variety of data sets in all areas of the discipline. © 2019 IEEE.","AI; Deep-Belie/Network; DL; ML; R","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Computer programming; Curricula; Data Science; Deep learning; Education computing; Intrusion detection; Cyber vulnerabilities; Deep-Belie/Network; Enterprise applications; Learning technology; Network intrusions; Predictive modeling; Science activities; University programs; Students","","","","","","","Whitlock J., Deploying ai in hospitals is delicate operation, San Diego Business Journal, (2019); Hodnett M., Wiley J.F., R Deep Learning Essentials, (2018); Idc, (2019); Romney G.W., Guymon J., Hands-on Cybersecurity Artificial Intelligence, Plenary Session Presentation, 23rd Colloquium for Information Systems Security Education, (2019); Intrusion Detection Data Set of 2 540,044 Records for Nine Types of Attacks, (2019); Open Source R Notebook, (2019); Hinton G., (2019); Geron A., Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow-Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems, (2017); Hinton G.E., Sindero S., The Y., A Fast Learning Algorithm for Deep Belief Nets, Neural Computation 18 1527-1554 Copyright 2006, (2006); Precision and Recall, (2019); F-measure, (2019); Deep Learning AI, (2019); AI Spending, (2018); AI for IT: Preventing Outages with Predictive Analytics, (2019); IDC, (2019); Deloitte, (2019); 1 Best Job in the U.S. For 2019, (2019); Internet Traffic, (2019); Big Data, (2019); Kepner J., Jananthan H., Mathematics of Big Data 2018, (2018); Data Science Skills, (2019); Rockstar Data Scientist, (2019); Sato K., Young C., Patterson D., An In-depth Look at Google's First Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), (2017); Guymon J., Romney G.W., A trellis for novice ai practitioners, 18th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training IEEE ITHET) 2019 Conference, (2019); Nour M., Slay J., Unsw-nb15: A comprehensive data set for network intrusion detection systems (unsw-nb15 network data set), Military Communications and Information Systems Conference (MilCIS), 2015, (2015); Nour M., Slay J., The evaluation of network anomaly detection systems: Statistical analysis of the unsw-nb15 dataset and the comparison with the kdd99 dataset, Information Security Journal: A Global Perspective, 2016, pp. 1-14, (2016); Nour M., Novel geometric area analysis technique for anomaly detection using trapezoidal area estimation on large-scale networks, IEEE Transactions on Big Data 2017, (2017); Nour M., Slay J., Significant Features of the UNSW-NB15 and the KDD99 Data Sets for Network Intrusion Detection Systems, Conference: Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Building Analysis Datasets and Gathering Experience Returns for Security (BADGERS 2015), 4, (2015); An Innovative Telemedicine Provider, (2019); A Data Science Analytics Provider, (2019); Data Processing Splitting a Sequential File into Smaller Files for Parallel Extracting, Transforming and Loading; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources Is An IT Healthcare Standard That Leverages Web Standards","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","18th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training, ITHET 2019","26 September 2019 through 27 September 2019","Magdeburg","156175","","978-172812464-3","","","English","Int.

To address the needs of students learning key data science and analytics skills we propose augmenting existing data science curriculums with hackathon events that focus on data also known as datathons. In this paper we present our experience at hosting and running four datathons that involved students and members from the community coming together to solve challenging problems with data from not-for-profit social good organizations and publicly open data. Our reported experience from our datathons will help in-form other academics and community groups who also wish to host datathons to help facilitate their students and mem-bers to learn key data science and analytics skills. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

This is the first phase of the Exploring Data Worlds at the Public Library research study research study, a two-year research study that explores the ways that libraries can address data literacy programming by helping teens understand, create and manage the digital traces of their data in meaningful, efficacious, and ethical ways. In this first phase of the study we explored the question What do young people understand about data within the context of their everyday lives and in relation to personal data management. We present here the findings from a series of semi-structured interviews with young people, ages 11 to 18, that examined teens' perceptions and general knowledge of data in their lives. Results suggest that the teens in this study had varying interpretations of the nature of data and a broad understanding of the lifecycle of data, but most found it difficult to connect with data at a concrete and personal level, with the notion of a personal data dossier either non-existent or abstract.

The adoption of DL in hydrology has so far been gradual, but the field is now ripe for breakthroughs. This paper suggests that DL-based methods can open up a complementary avenue toward knowledge discovery in hydrologic sciences. In the new avenue, machine-learning algorithms present competing hypotheses that are consistent with data. Interrogative methods are then invoked to interpret DL models for scientists to further evaluate. However, hydrology presents many challenges for DL methods, such as data limitations, heterogeneity and co-evolution, and the general inexperience of the hydrologic field with DL. The roadmap toward DL-powered scientific advances will require the coordinated effort from a large community involving scientists and citizens. Integrating process-based models with DL models will help alleviate data limitations. The sharing of data and baseline models will improve the efficiency of the community as a whole. Open competitions could serve as the organizing events to greatly propel growth and nurture data science education in hydrology, which demands a grassroots collaboration. The area of hydrologic DL presents numerous research opportunities that could, in turn, stimulate advances in machine learning as well. © 2018 Author(s).","","Artificial intelligence; Hydrology; Learning algorithms; Data limitations; Hydrologic science; Industry applications; Integrating process; Research opportunities; Science education; Scientific advances; Scientific discovery; algorithm; applied science; education; heterogeneity; hydrology; knowledge; machine learning; technology adoption; Deep learning","","","","","U.S. National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (403047, EAR-1338606, EAR-1832294); National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-SC0016605); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province, SPDST, (2018SZ0343); Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province, SPDST; Sichuan University, SCU, (CCF-1317560); Sichuan University, SCU; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics","Acknowledgements.

In this paper, we examine the sociotechnical practices of data wrangling—strategies for selecting and managing datasets to produce a model and story in a big data interface—for youth assembling models and stories about family migration using interactive data visualization tools. Through interaction analysis of video data, we identified ten data wrangling practices and developed a conceptual model of the data wrangling process that contains four interrelated recursive stages. These data wrangling practices and the process of data wrangling are important to understand for supporting future data science education opportunities that facilitate learning and discussion about scientific and socioeconomic issues. This study also sheds light on how the family migration modeling context positioned the youth as having agency and authority over big data. © ISLS.","Data science education; Data wrangling; Family migration; Modeling; Storytelling","E-learning; Large dataset; Models; Visualization; Data technologies; Data visualization tools; Data wrangling; Family migration; Interaction analysis; Science education; Storytelling; Visualization technologies; Data visualization","","","","","","","Azevedo F.S., Mann M.J., Seeing in the dark: Embodied cognition in amateur astronomy practice, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 27, 1, pp. 89-136, (2018); Bandura A., Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social-Cognitive View, (1986); Borner K., Peppler K., Kennedy B., Uzzo S., Heimlich J., Data Visualization Literacy: Research and Tools That Advance Public Understanding of Scientific Data, Nsf-National Science Foundation, (2017); Boyd D., Crawford K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon, Information, Communication & Society, 15, 5, pp. 662-679, (2012); Engel J., Statistical literacy for active citizenship: A call for data science education, Statistics Education Research Journal, 16, 1, pp. 44-49, (2017); Enyedy N., Mukhopadhyay S., They don’t show nothing I didn’t know: Emergent tensions between culturally relevant pedagogy and mathematics pedagogy, The Journal of the Learning Sciences, 16, 2, pp. 139-174, (2007); Fivush R., Bohanek J.G., Zaman W., Personal and intergenerational narratives in relation to adolescents’ well‐being, New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 2011, 131, pp. 45-57, (2011); Gibson J.J., The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception, (1986); Glaser B.G., The constant comparative method of qualitative analysis, Social Problems, 12, 4, pp. 436-445, (1965); Greeno J.G., Gibson’s affordances, Psychological Review, 101, pp. 336-342, (1994); Greeno J.G., Engestrom Y., Learning in activity, The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences, pp. 128-147, (2014); Hall R., Leander K., Scaling practices of spatial analysis and modeling, Scaling Practices of Spatial Analysis and Modeling.

Using lots of sandboxes that would consume tremendous resources is not an effective solution. This paper propose a solution that design and implement Hadoop as a private online service that could effectively meet the design characteristics of an academic data science computing platform. The propose design emphasise a quick deployment solution based on available resources and technologies. The case study that follow demonstrate and cultivate our approach as a proof of concept for any academic institutions to implement their own services.

The virtues of the twentieth Century Virtuous Cycle (aka virtuous hardwaresoftware cycle, Intel-Microsoft virtuous cycle) that built the personal computer industry (National Research Council, The new global ecosystem in advanced computing: Implications for U.S. competitiveness and national security. The National Academies Press, Washington, DC, 2012) were being grounded in reality and being self-perpetuating-more powerful hardware enabled more powerful software that required more powerful hardware, enabling yet more powerful software, and so forth. Being grounded in reality-solving genuine problems at scale-was critical to its success, as it will be for data science. While it lasted, it was self-perpetuating, due to a constant flow of innovation, and to benefitting all participants-producers, consumers, the industry, the economy, and society. It is a wonderful success story for twentieth Century applied science. Given the success of virtuous cycles in developing modern technology, virtuous cycles grounded in reality should be used to develop data science, driven by the wisdom of the sixteenth Century proverb, Necessity is the mother of invention. This chapter explores this hypothesis using the example of the evolution of database management systems over the last 40 years. For the application of data science to be successful and virtuous, it should be grounded in a cycle that encompasses industry (i.e., real problems), research, development, and delivery. This chapter proposes applying the principles and lessons of the virtuous cycle to the development of data science applications; to the development of the data science discipline itself, for example, a data science method; and to the development of data science education; all focusing on the critical role of collaboration in data science research and management, thereby addressing the development challenges faced by the more than 150 Data Science Research Institutes (DSRIs) worldwide. A companion chapter (Brodie, What is Data Science, in Braschler et al (Eds.), Applied data science - Lessons learned for the data-driven business, Springer 2019), addresses essential questions that DSRIs should answer in preparation for the developments proposed here: What is data science? What is world-class data science research?. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","","","","","","","","","Michael Stonebraker, 2014 Turing Award Citation, (2015); American Journal of Translational Research, (2018); Angwin J., Larson J., Mattu S., Kirchner L., Machine Bias: There’s software used across the country to predict future criminals, (2016); Braschler M., Stadelmann T., Stockinger K., Applied data science-Lessons learned for the data-driven business, (2019); Brodie M.L., Understanding data science: An emerging discipline for data-intensive discovery, Getting data right: Tackling the challenges of big data volume and variety, (2015); Brodie M.L., What is data science?, Applied data science-Lessons learned for the data-driven business, (2019); Brodie M.L., Making databases work: The pragmatic wisdom of Michael Stonebraker, (2019); Chipman I., How data analytics is going to transform all industries, Stanford Engineering Magazine, (2016); Codd E.F., A relational model of data for large shared data banks, Communications of the ACM, 13, 6, pp. 377-387, (1970); Davenport T.H., Patil D.J., Data scientist: The sexiest job of the 21st century, Harvard Business Review, 90, 10, pp. 70-76, (2012); Demirkan H., Dal B., The data economy: Why do so many analytics projects fail?, Analytics Magazine, (2014); Dohzen T., Pamuk M., Seong S.W., Hammer J., Stonebraker M., Data integration through transform reuse in the Morpheus project, ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 736-738, (2006); Who’s afraid of disruption?

Although some conceptions of data science focus primarily on analytical methods, data scientists must also have a deep understanding of how project data were collected, preprocessed and transformed. These processes strongly influence the analytical methods that can be applied, and more importantly how the results of those methods should be interpreted. In the present chapter we provide background information on educational challenges for data scientists and report on the results of a workshop where experts from the information field brainstormed on the educational dimensions of data science. Results of the workshop showed that data scientists must possess a breadth of expertise across three areas - curation, analytics, and cyber-infrastructure - with deep knowledge in at least one of these areas. Workshop participants also underscored the importance of domain knowledge to the success of the data science role. Additionally, the workshop highlighted a factor that differentiates data science from other professional specialties: the emphasis on serving the data needs of information users and decision makers. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","","Data visualization; Information management; Information services; Background information; Cyber infrastructures; Educational challenge; Heterogeneous data; Information professionals; Information users; Science education; Workshop participants; Metadata","","","","","","","Allard S., Levine K.J., Tenopir C., Design engineers and technical professionals at work: Observing information usage in the workplace, J.

This has led to over a decade of calls to establish a corresponding field of Data Science Education. There is still a need, however, to more deeply conceptualize what a field of Data Science Education might entail in terms of scope, responsibility, and execution. This special issue explores how one distinguishing feature of Data Science—its focus on data collected from social and environmental contexts within which learners often find themselves deeply embedded—suggests serious implications for learning and education. The learning sciences is uniquely positioned to investigate how such contextual embeddings impact learners’ engagement with data including conceptual, experiential, communal, racialized, spatial, and political dimensions. This special issue demonstrates the richly layered relationships learners build with data and reveals them to be not merely utilitarian mechanisms for learning about data, but a critical part of navigating data as social text and understanding Data Science as a discipline. Together, the contributions offer a vision of how the learning sciences can contribute to a more expansive, agentive and socially aware Data Science Education. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","National Science Foundation Cyberlearning capacity building; National Science Foundation, NSF, (IIS-1541676)","Funding text 1: Many ideas discussed in this introduction emerged from collective discussion at the 2016 Youth, Learning, and Data Science Summit.

This has led to a number of opinion pieces advocating for an update to the Statistics curriculum. The unifying recommendation is that computing should play a more prominent role. We strongly agree with this recommendation, but advocate the main priority is to bring applications to the forefront as proposed by Nolan and Speed in 1999. We also argue that the individuals tasked with developing data science courses should not only have statistical training, but also have experience analyzing data with the main objective of solving real-world problems. Here, we share a set of general principles and offer a detailed guide derived from our successful experience developing and teaching a graduate-level, introductory data science course centered entirely on case studies. We argue for the importance of statistical thinking, as defined by Wild and Pfannkuch in 1999 and describe how our approach teaches students three key skills needed to succeed in data science, which we refer to as creating, connecting, and computing. This guide can also be used for statisticians wanting to gain more practical knowledge about data science before embarking on teaching an introductory course.

Although some standalone programs in Data Science have been established around the country, many institutions encounter the challenges in balancing the curricula among different disciplines, allocating new resources, and cooperating with the existing majors regarding enrollment management, student advising, and faculty preparation. In this paper, a strategy-based framework is proposed for those who have limited resources of all kinds to introduce Data Science through their existing Computer Science programs at a baccalaureate level with a minimum curriculum disruption. Instead of a standalone program, to embed Data Science into Computer Science education is demonstrated to be a practical, effective, cost-saving approach based on an extensive study of the synergy between Data Science and Computer Science education. While the proposed framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach, it provides a doable route for blending Data Science into Computer Science education in systematic ways. It has become the consensus that an adequate exposure to Data Science will better prepare computer science students for taking the challenges in this ever-changing, data embraced world. © 2019 IEEE.","Computer Science Education; Curriculum Design; Data Science Education","Blending; Curricula; Data Science; Education computing; Engineering education; Students; Computer Science Education; Computer science programs; Computer science students; Cost saving; Curriculum designs; Enrollment management; Library science; Science education; Information management","","","","","","","Berman F., Rutenbar R., Hailpern B., Christensen H., Davidson S., Estrin D., Franklin M., Martonosi M., Raghavan P., Stodden V., Szalay A.S., Realizing the potential of data science, The Communications of the ACM, 61, 4, pp. 67-72, (2018); Burtch L., The Burtch Works Study: Salaries of Data Scientists, (2018); Cao L., Data science: A comprehensive overview, The ACM Computing Surveys, 50, 3, pp. 431-4342, (2017); Carson C., Culler D., Jacobsen B., Berkeley's Undergraduate Data Science Curriculum: Year 1 Pedagogical Overview, (2018); De Veaux R.D., Agarwal M., Averett M., Baumer B.S., Bray A., Bressoud T.C., Bryant L., Cheng L.Z., Francis A., Gould R., Kim A.Y., Kretchmar M., Lu Q., Moskol A., Nolan D., Pelayo R., Raleigh S., Sethi R.J., Sondjaja M., Tiruviluamala N., Uhlig P.X., Washington T.M., Wesley C.L., White D., Ye P., Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science, The Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, pp. 21-216, (2017); Demchenko Y., Belloum A., Wiktorski T., EDISON Data Science Framework: Part 1.

In this paper, we describe the use of qualitative and quantitative methods to study data science projects completed by undergraduate students who are learning data science but have already learned computer programming. The projects are stored as Jupyter notebooks: documents that store code, as well as its output from execution, formatted text for self-explanations, and graphics. Our analysis of the notebooks discovers two kinds of student attitudes: explorers, who work iteratively, and goal accomplishers, who work incrementally. Despite varying attitudes, we find that students often fluctuate between the two learner types depending on their computational goals for a given notebook. Moreover, when students practice the explorer approach, they often engage more actively with many CT skills such as pattern generalization and communication of results. Finally, we propose ways to utilize these findings to encourage CT practices in future data science curricula. © 2018, The Education University of Hong Kong.

Thus, researchers have suggested the urgency for universities to review their curricular as the world is heading towards data era. The aim of this research was to analyze the current skill-gaps needs from stakeholders and opportunities to establish data science postgraduate programme that reflects the current technological trends and market demands at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM). A questionnaire was administered to 85 identified organizations to solicit information on the needs for data scientists and existing skill gaps. A total of 61 filled questionnaires response were received out of the 85 that were administered to selected organizations indicating a turn out rate of over 70%. Overall the analyzed data articulated a compelling evidence for the local industry growing need for data scientist. The survey that was conducted was followed up by conduct of various workshops and meetings to solicit inputs from different experts and stakeholders on different versions of the developed curriculum. Finally, a new programme in MSc in data Science was approved and established from April 2018 at UDSM. Despite its late approval and without formal advertisement on the public media, the programme attracted a large number of applicants for 2018/19 academic year, compared to other several postgraduate programmes in ICT offered at UDSM. &#x00A9; 2019, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Data science; Data science education; Data scientists; ICT; Skills-gap; UDSM","Commerce; Developing countries; Social aspects; Surveys; Current demands; Data scientists; International Federation for Information Processing; Postgraduate education; Science education; Skills gaps; Technological trends; UDSM; Data Science","","","","","PEPFAR/MCC; University of Dar es Salaam","South African educational institutions stands by far as African leading institutions in provision of different forms of data science education including the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) South Africa [11] which offers two months intensive data science training and the University of Witwatersrand [12], offering a one year degree program in Big data Analytics. Tanzania has not been left behind, in this dynamics as there has been a few initiatives that aim to strengthen data use and data driven innovation although largely funded through international donor programs. As part of open government partnership (OGP) membership the country implemented a basic statistics public data portal, and received data capacity building support through the World Bank and other international donor agencies [13]. The basic statistics portal [14] was established to provide data in a machine readable format to be used and reused by anybody. The data provided apply only to data and information produced or commissioned by government especially the prioritized sectors of Education, Water and Health. The most recent notable program for strengthening country data capacity is the Tanzania Data Lab project (dLab) [15] that started in April 2016 to June 2018 that sought to promote greater data use in the country through fostering data availability and data literacy. The dLab project was led by the UDSM through PEPFAR/MCC funding, and one key outcome from the project has been the motivation to expand data literacy through mainstreaming the data science education in higher learning institutions.","Manyika J., Et al., Big Data: The Next Frontier for Innovation, Competition, and Productivity, (2011); Becker T., Curry E., Jentzsch A., Palmetshofer W., New Horizons for a Data-Driven Economy: Roadmaps and Action Plans for Technology, Businesses, Policy, and Society, pp. 277-291, (2016); Aalst W.M.P., Data scientist: The engineer of the future, Enterprise Interoperability VI.

The curriculum design transforms human-centered principles into practice. The poster visually illustrates the trajectory of these principles in relation to three specific graduate attributes, using a selection of deep dives into the learning design. To illustrate the specific power information theory and practice has to shape data science training, the poster uses evocative quotes from information science theorists and displays how their work significantly influenced the overall philosophy of the program, student activities and assessments. Using ‘gamestorming’ techniques during the poster session, the audience is invited to contribute further insights about ways to nurture the deeply human capacities of the data scientists we train.
