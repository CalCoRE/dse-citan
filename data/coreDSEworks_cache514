THE RADICAL GROWTH IN RECENT YEARS IN THE AVAILABILITY OF DATA AND OF THE COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES REQUIRED TO PROCESS THEM, HAS LED TO A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR DATA SCIENTISTS. AS A RESULT, NEW DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE OPENING AT A GROWING RATE. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, SEVERAL PAPERS ON DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS WERE PUBLISHED, FOCUSING ON THEIR CURRICULAR ASPECTS. THE PEDAGOGY OF THOSE PROGRAMS, HOWEVER, HAS RECEIVED ONLY LITTLE ATTENTION. TO PARTIALLY CLOSE THIS GAP, MY DOCTORAL RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE PEDAGOGICAL ASPECTS OF DATA SCIENCE. THE PILOT PHASE OF THE RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT IN GRADUATE, UNDERGRADUATE, AND HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS. THE RESULTS OF THE PILOT RESEARCH ARE ORGANIZED BY A FRAMEWORK OF TEN CHALLENGES OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PEDAGOGICAL CHALLENGES OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION FOR VARIOUS POPULATIONS AND TO DEVELOP PEDAGOGICAL METHODS FOR COPING WITH THEM. THE CURRENT STAGE OF RESEARCH AIMS TO VALIDATE THIS FRAMEWORK.","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ANDERSON P., 2014, AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN DATA SCIENCE., P145;ANDERSON P, 2014, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 45TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION (SIGCSE'14), P145;BERMAN F, 2018, COMMUN ACM, V61, P67, DOI 10.1145/3188721;BRYANT C, 2019, SIGCSE '19: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 50TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, P358, DOI 10.1145/3287324.3287510;CURRICULUM TEAM, 2019, INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE.;DANYLUK A, 2019, SIGCSE '19: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 50TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, P496, DOI 10.1145/3287324.3287522;DE VEAUX RD, 2017, ANNU REV STAT APPL, V4, P15, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV-STATISTICS-060116-053930;DRYER A, 2018, SIGCSE'18: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 49TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, P753, DOI 10.1145/3159450.3159553;GOULD R., 2018, MOBILIZE: A DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM FOR 16-YEAR-OLD STUDENTS., V10;HAQQI S, 2018, ITICSE'18: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD ANNUAL ACM CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, P387, DOI 10.1145/3197091.3205812;HAVILL J, 2019, SIGCSE '19: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 50TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, P9, DOI 10.1145/3287324.3287436;HEINEMANN B., 2018, ACM INT C P SER;KHURI S, 2017, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ACM SIGCSE TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION (SIGCSE'17), P315, DOI 10.1145/3017680.3017721;MIKE K., TEN CHALLENGES OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION;RAJ RK, 2019, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2019 ACM CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION (ITICSE '19), P265, DOI 10.1145/3304221.3325533;SHULMAN, 1987, KNOWLEDGE AND TEACHING: KNOWLEDGE GROWTH IN TEACHING.PDF;SRIKANT S, 2017, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ACM SIGCSE TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION (SIGCSE'17), P561, DOI 10.1145/3017680.3017717;SWELLER J, 2019, EDUC PSYCHOL REV, V31, P261, DOI 10.1007/S10648-019-09465-5;TARTARO A., 2015, SIGCSE 2015 P 46 ACM, P120","MIKE, K (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL, FAC EDUC SCI & TECHNOL, HAIFA, ISRAEL.",NA,"ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ENGLISH",NA,"PROCEEDINGS PAPER",NA,NA,"ISI","WOS:001304831400041","[MIKE, KOBY] TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL, FAC EDUC SCI & TECHNOL, HAIFA, ISRAEL.","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 ACM CONFERENCE ON INTERNATIONAL COMPUTING EDUCATION RESEARCH, ICER 2020","TECHNION ISRAEL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL","NA","MIKE K, 2020, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 ACM CONFERENCE ON INTERNATIONAL COMPUTING EDUCATION RESEARCH, ICER 2020","MIKE K, 2020, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 ACM CONFERENCE ON INTERNATIONAL COMPUTING EDUCATION RESEARCH, ICER 2020",NA,NA,"978-1-4503-7092-9","324","TECHNION ISRAEL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","ELECTR NETWORK","ACM CONFERENCE ON INTERNATIONAL COMPUTING EDUCATION RESEARCH (ICER)","AUG 10-12, 2020","2024-12-10",NA,NA,NA,"MIKE@CAMPUS.TECHNION.AC.IL","325","","BX5YA","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY",NA,"19",NA,"1601 BROADWAY, 10TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",NA,"2","NEW YORK",NA,"C",NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE;

THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO MAP THE LANDSCAPE OF EXISTING CURRICULA AND EXPLORE HOW ACADEMIC LIBRARIES CAN COLLABORATE AND CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERGRADUATE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYZED TEACHING CONTENT AND TOPICS OF OVER 100 DATA SCIENCE RELATED COURSES AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY TO MAP THE LANDSCAPE AND EXPLORE ROLES OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES TO SUPPORT DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION CURRICULUM. OUR RESULTS INDICATE MOST EXISTING COURSES FOCUSED ON ?HARD-CORE? SCIENTIFIC ANALYTIC PRINCIPLES, SUCH AS COMPUTER SCIENCE, STATISTICS, AND DOMAIN-SPECIFIC SKILLS. COURSES OF DATA-ORIENTED SKILLS, SUCH AS DATA MANAGEMENT, DATA ETHICS, AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS WERE LIMITED ACROSS DISCIPLINES.

HOWEVER, CURRENTLY, DATA SCIENCE EDUCATORS LACK GOOD TOOLS AND METHODOLOGIES. IN PARTICULAR, THEY LACK INTEGRATED TOOLS THROUGH WHICH THEIR STUDENTS CAN ACQUIRE HANDS-ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING EXPERIENCE. TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS, WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED DATALAB, A WEB-BASED TOOL FOR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION THAT INTEGRATES CODE, DATA AND EXECUTION MANAGEMENT INTO ONE SYSTEM. THE GOAL OF DATALAB IS TO PROVIDE A HANDS-ON ONLINE LAB ENVIRONMENT TO TRAIN STUDENTS TO HAVE BASIC SOFTWARE ENGINEERING THINKING AND HABITS WHILE MAINTAINING A FOCUS ON THE CORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENTS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT THE USER-EXPERIENCE DESIGN AND SYSTEM-LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION OF DATALAB. FURTHER, WE EVALUATE DATALAB'S PERFORMANCE THROUGH AN IN-CLASSROOM USE CASE.

ALTHOUGH EXTRACURRICULAR EFFORTS ALREADY EXIST FOR MANY COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE DISCIPLINES, THEIR SUPPORT OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HELPED IN COPING WITH THE SPEED OF INNOVATION IN DATA SCIENCE PRACTICE AND FORMAL CURRICULA. WHILE THE PROLIFERATION OF AD HOC EFFORTS IS AN INDICATION OF THEIR POPULARITY, LESS HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED ABOUT THE NEEDS THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED TO MEET, THE LIMITATIONS THAT THEY FACE, AND PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR HOLDING SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS. TO HOLISTICALLY UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF DIFFERENT AD HOC FORMATS FOR DATA SCIENCE, WE SURVEYED ORGANIZERS OF AD HOC DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW ORGANIZERS PERCEIVED THE EVENTS TO HAVE GONE-INCLUDING AREAS OF STRENGTH AND AREAS REQUIRING GROWTH. WE ALSO GATHERED RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THESE PAST EVENTS FOR FUTURE ORGANIZERS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF AD HOC EFFORTS GO BEYOND DEVELOPING TECHNICAL SKILLS AND MAY PROVIDE CONTINUED BENEFIT IN CONJUNCTION WITH FORMAL CURRICULA, WHICH WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION. AS INCREASING NUMBERS OF RESEARCHERS FROM COMPUTATIONAL FIELDS WITH A HISTORY OF COMPLEX DATA BECOME INVOLVED WITH AD HOC EFFORTS TO SHARE THEIR SKILLS, THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE EXTRACT FROM THE SURVEYS WILL PROVIDE CONCRETE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE PRACTITIONER-LEADERS INTERESTED IN CREATING, IMPROVING, AND SUSTAINING FUTURE EFFORTS. AUTHOR SUMMARY LARGE DATASETS ARE BECOMING INTEGRAL TO SOCIETY BROADLY AND TO BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES IN PARTICULAR. AS A RESULT, DEMAND FOR SOPHISTICATED DATA SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE HAS SKYROCKETED AND LEFT SOME INDIVIDUALS SCRAMBLING TO CROSS-TRAIN AND ACQUIRE MORE COMPUTATIONAL SKILLS. WHILE UNIVERSITIES ARE RACING TO DEVELOP FORMAL CURRICULA TO MEET THIS DEMAND, DIVERSE INFORMAL EFFORTS HAVE EMERGED TO FILL THE IMMEDIATE DEMAND FOR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE. THESE ""AD HOC"" EFFORTS HAVE BEEN PLAYING A VITAL ROLE IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, ESPECIALLY FOR DOMAIN SCIENTISTS. WHILE SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN SPECIFIC AD HOC FORMATS TO HAVE CONSIDERABLE IMPACT, FEW STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THESE EFFORTS HOLISTICALLY. HERE, WE SURVEY EFFORT ORGANIZERS FROM LEADING DATA SCIENCE INSTITUTES AND COLLECT LESSONS LEARNED. WE FIND THAT EFFORTS ARE COMMONLY REPORTED TO SUCCESSFULLY PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES IN DIFFICULT AREAS WHERE CURRICULA COULD IMPROVE, SUCH AS PROVIDING APPROACHABLE INTRODUCTIONS TO NEW SKILLS, INCREASING DIVERSITY OF BACKGROUNDS, AND FOSTERING HETEROGENEOUS COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER, EFFORTS ALSO REPORT CHALLENGES FULFILLING DIVERSE NEEDS AND OFFER SUGGESTIONS. IN TOTAL, THE LESSONS THAT WE COLLECT FROM THESE EFFORTS ARE USEFUL TO IMPROVE FUTURE AD HOC EFFORTS AND TO INFORM FORMAL PROGRAMS, WHICH MAY BE LOOKING FOR INSPIRATION TO DESIGN INNOVATIVE EDUCATIONAL FORMATS.",NA,"TOOLS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ALLEN G, 2011, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V4, P1927, DOI 10.1016/J.PROCS.2011.04.210;ANONYMOUS, BIORXIV;ANONYMOUS, BIORXIV;ANONYMOUS, CREAT I CHANG DAT SC;ANONYMOUS, BLOOMB DAT GOOD EXCH;ANONYMOUS, 2018, TOXICOL ANAL CLIN, DOI DOI 10.1080/09602011.2018.1470987;ANONYMOUS, 2019, QUALITATIVE RES USIN;ANONYMOUS, DIABETES CARE S1;ANONYMOUS, J CANC RES THER;ANONYMOUS, SOFTWARE CARPENTRY A;ANONYMOUS, 2014, P 13 PYTHON SCI C;ATWOOD TK, 2015, PLOS COMPUT BIOL, V11, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1004143;BAUMER B, 2015, AM STAT, V69, P334, DOI 10.1080/00031305.2015.1081105;BUDD A, 2015, PLOS COMPUT BIOL, V11, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1003905;CAO LB, 2017, ACM COMPUT SURV, V50, DOI 10.1145/3076253;ÇETINKAYA-RUNDEL M, 2018, AM STAT, V72, P58, DOI 10.1080/00031305.2017.1397549;CORBIN J, 1990, Z SOZIOL, V19, P418, DOI 10.1007/BF00988593;DEVENYI GA, 2018, PLOS COMPUT BIOL, V14, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1005963;FELDON DF, 2017, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V114, P9854, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.1705783114;GRAZIOTIN D, 2017, 2017 IEEE/ACM 2ND INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON EMOTION AWARENESS IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (SEMOTION 2017), P42, DOI 10.1109/SEMOTION.2017.5;GUTLERNER JL, 2013, CELL, V153, P731, DOI 10.1016/J.CELL.2013.04.027;HILL BM, 2017, COMPUT SOC SCI, P115, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-59186-5_9;HOLDGRAF CHRIS, 2017, P PRACT EXP ADV RES;HUPPENKOTHEN D, 2018, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V115, P8872, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.1717196115;JACOBS C., 2016, JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCE EDUCATION, V64, P183, DOI 10.5408/15-101;KROSS S, 2019, S VIS LANG HUM CEN C, P65, DOI 10.1109/VLHCC.2019.8818824, 10.1109/VLHCC.2019.8818824;LESCAK EA, 2019, PLOS COMPUT BIOL, V15, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1006920;MASTERS KS, 2017, PLOS COMPUT BIOL, V13, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1005709;MCDONALD NORA, 2019, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION, V3, DOI 10.1145/3359174;MILLMAN KJ, 2018, FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ, V12, DOI 10.3389/FNINS.2018.00727;ROSENMAN ROBERT, 2011, INT J BEHAV HEALTHC RES, V2, P320;STEFAN MI, 2015, PLOS COMPUT BIOL, V11, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1004208;STEVENS SARAH L R, 2018, PLOS BIOL, V16, PE2005561, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.2005561;THOMAS DR, 2006, AM J EVAL, V27, P237, DOI 10.1177/1098214005283748;VIA A, 2013, BRIEF BIOINFORM, V14, P528, DOI 10.1093/BIB/BBT043;VIA A, 2011, PLOS COMPUT BIOL, V7, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1002245;WEST JD, 2016, INFORM POL, P129;WILSON G, 2014, PLOS BIOL, V12, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.1001745;WILSON GREG., 2016, F1000RESEARCH, P3","DEMASI, O (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV CALIF DAVIS, DEPT COMP SCI, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA.",NA,"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ENGLISH","PLOS COMPUT.

AT THE SAME TIME, PHILOSOPHERS OF SCIENCE FACE THE CHALLENGE OF MAKING THEIR EXPERTISE ACCESSIBLE FOR SCIENTISTS IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT CAN IMPROVE EVERYDAY RESEARCH PRACTICE. HERE, WE INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY OF APPROACHING THESE CHALLENGES TOGETHER. IN CURRENT AND PROPOSED APPROACHES TO BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, WE IDENTIFY A DOMINANT FOCUS ON ONLY ONE ASPECT OF CONDUCTING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: UNDERSTANDING AND USING DATA, RESEARCH METHODS, AND STATISTICAL METHODS. WE ARGUE THAT THIS APPROACH CANNOT SOLVE BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE'S CHALLENGE AND WE PROPOSE TO SHIFT THE FOCUS TO FOUR OTHER ASPECTS OF CONDUCTING RESEARCH: MAKING AND JUSTIFYING DECISIONS IN RESEARCH DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION, EXPLAINING THEIR EPISTEMIC AND NON-EPISTEMIC EFFECTS, BALANCING VARYING RESPONSIBILITIES, AND REPORTING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. ATTENDING TO THESE ASPECTS REQUIRES LEARNING ON DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS THAN SOLELY LEARNING TO APPLY TECHNIQUES (FIRST DIMENSION). IT ALSO REQUIRES LEARNING TO MAKE CHOICES (SECOND DIMENSION) AND TO UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE BEHIND CHOICES (THIRD DIMENSION). THIS COULD BE FOSTERED BY INTEGRATING PHILOSOPHICAL TRAINING IN BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. FURTHERMORE, PHILOSOPHICAL TRAINING FOSTERS A FOURTH DIMENSION OF LEARNING, NAMELY, UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF SCIENCE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EXPLAIN HOW WE IDENTIFIED THE FIVE ASPECTS OF CONDUCTING RESEARCH AND THE FOUR DIMENSIONS OF LEARNING, AND WHY ATTENDING TO THE FOURTH DIMENSION IS ESSENTIAL.

WITH THE EXPANSION OF HIGHER EDUCATION DEDICATED TO CULTIVATING DATA SCIENTISTS, INTEGRATING DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION INTO UNIVERSITY CURRICULA HAS BECOME IMPERATIVE. HOWEVER, ADDRESSING DIVERSE STUDENT BACKGROUNDS UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF COURSE CONTENT AND DESIGN. THIS STUDY SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWS 60 DATA SCIENCE COURSES SYLLABI IN GENERAL EDUCATION ACROSS ALL UNIVERSITIES IN TAIWAN. UTILIZING CONTENT ANALYSIS, BIBLIOMETRIC, AND TEXT-MINING METHODOLOGIES, THIS STUDY QUANTIFIES KEY METRICS FOUND WITHIN SYLLABI, INCLUDING INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS, ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES, LEARNING OBJECTIVES, AND COVERED TOPICS. THE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS INFREQUENT TEXTBOOK SHARING, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON PYTHON PROGRAMMING. ASSESSMENT METHODS PRIMARILY INVOLVE PARTICIPATION, ASSIGNMENTS, AND PROJECTS. ANALYSIS OF BLOOM'S TAXONOMY SUGGESTS A FOCUS ON MODERATE COMPLEXITY LEARNING OBJECTIVES. THE TOPICS COVERED PRIORITIZE BIG DATA COMPETENCY, ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES, PROGRAMMING COMPETENCY, AND TEACHING STRATEGIES IN DESCENDING ORDER. THIS STUDY MAKES A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE BY TACKLING THE CHALLENGE OF DELINEATING THE SPECIFIC CONTENT OF DATA SCIENCE. IT ALSO PROVIDES VALUABLE REFERENCES FOR POTENTIALLY STREAMLINING THE INTEGRATION OF MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES WITHIN INTRODUCTORY COURSES WHILE ENSURING FLEXIBILITY FOR STUDENTS WITH VARYING PROGRAMMING AND STATISTICAL PROFICIENCIES IN THE REALM OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION.","CURRICULUM ANALYSIS; DATA SCIENCE LITERACY; BIBLIOMETRIC; TEXT MINING","BIG DATA; STUDENTS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"MINISTRY OF EDUCATION OF TAIWAN [PBM1123243]","THIS RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION OF TAIWAN (GRANT NUMBER PBM1123243).","AASHEIM C.L., 2015, J INFORM SYSTEMS ED, V26, P103;ACM DATA SCIENCE TASK FORCE, 2021, COMPUTING COMPETENCIES FOR UNDERGRADUATE DATA SCIENCE CURRICULA;ALBERS C, 2003, TEACH SOCIOL, V31, P60, DOI 10.2307/3211425;ANDERSON L.

STUDIES FOCUSING ON METHODS FOR INTEGRATING ETHICS INTO DATA SCIENCE COURSES REVEAL THAT STUDENTS TEND TO NEGLECT ETHICAL CONCERNS IN THEIR DATA ANALYSIS. BASED ON THE DATA WE COLLECTED FROM QUESTIONNAIRES DISTRIBUTED TO UNDERGRADUATE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING STUDENTS, THIS PAPER EXPANDS THE DISCUSSION BEYOND HUMAN CONCERNS AND ETHICS IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. AS WE WILL SHOW, STUDENTS TEND TO NEGLECT THE CONTEXT WHEN ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE DATA SCIENCE QUESTIONS. WE ARGUE THAT GAPS IN UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEXT RELATING TO THE DATA RESULT IN GAPS IN THE ANALYSIS AS WELL AS IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA. THUS, WE PROPOSE ANTHROPOLOGICAL THINKING AS A PEDAGOGY TO OVERCOME THE CONTEXT NEGLECT. PLACING THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE CONTEXT PROMOTES A HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHENOMENON BEING ANALYZED, AS IT INCLUDES IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS THAT DO NOT NECESSARILY FIT THE MORE COMMONLY USED TERM HUMAN CONCERNS.","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; APPLICATION DOMAIN; ANTHROPOLOGY; CONTEXT; DATA THINKING",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ACM CODE OF ETHICS, 2018, CODE 2018-ACM ETHICS;ANONYMOUS, 2022, CAMBRIDGE DICT;ANONYMOUS, 2000, P PARCHI 2000 WORKSH;BANKS M., 2001, VISUAL METHODS IN SOCIAL RESEARCH;BOWMAN GLENN., 1997, AFTER WRITING CULTURE, P34;BROWN NOELLE, 2022, ICER 2022 V1: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2022 ACM CONFERENCE ON INTERNATIONAL COMPUTING EDUCATION RESEARCH V.1, P344, DOI 10.1145/3501385.3543978;BUBANDT N, 2010, EXPERIMENTS IN HOLISM: THEORY AND PRACTICE IN CONTEMPORARY ANTHROPOLOGY, P1;DILLEY RM, 2002, LANG COMMUN, V22, P437, DOI 10.1016/S0271-5309(02)00019-8;ERIKSEN T.

DATA FEMINISM IS AN APPROACH THAT DRAWS ON FEMINIST SCHOLARSHIP AND ACTION TO HUMANIZE DATA AND CONTEND WITH THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DATA AND POWER. IN THIS REVIEW PAPER, WE DRAW ON PRINCIPLES FROM DATA FEMINISM TO REVIEW 42 DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND DESIGN APPROACHES THAT ENGAGE YOUTH WITH DATA, MANY OF WHICH ARE EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY INTENSIVE AND BEAR ON FUTURE DATA-INTENSIVE EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DESIGN PROJECTS. WE DESCRIBE HOW THE PROJECTS ENGAGE STUDENTS WITH EXAMINING POWER, CHALLENGING POWER, ELEVATING EMOTION AND LIVED EXPERIENCE, RETHINKING BINARIES AND HIERARCHIES, EMBRACING PLURALISM, CONSIDERING CONTEXT, AND MAKING LABOUR VISIBLE. IN DOING SO, WE ARTICULATE WAYS THAT CURRENT DATA EDUCATION INITIATIVES INVOLVE YOUTH IN THINKING ABOUT ISSUES OF JUSTICE AND INCLUSION. THESE PROJECTS MAY OFFER EXAMPLES OF VARYING COMPLEXITY FOR FUTURE WORK TO CONTEND WITH AND, IDEALLY, EXTEND IN ORDER TO FURTHER REALIZE DATA FEMINISM IN K-12 DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. PRACTITIONER NOTES WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC DATA FEMINISM IS AN EMERGENT FRAMEWORK FOR CHANGING DATA PRACTICES AND DISCOURSE IN SERVICE OF EQUITY AND JUSTICE. DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IS RAPIDLY GROWING AS A TOPIC OF INTEREST IN THE EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DESIGN COMMUNITIES. MANY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN PROJECTS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED AND SHARED IN PUBLICATIONS THAT PRECEDED THE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION OF THE DATA FEMINISM FRAMEWORK. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS DATA FEMINISM IS PARTIALLY RE-ARTICULATED IN TERMS FAMILIAR TO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH COMMUNITIES. PRIOR AND RECENT PROJECTS ARE ORGANIZED WITH RESPECT TO HOW THEY ILLUSTRATE POTENTIAL CONNECTIONS TO CORE DATA FEMINISM PRINCIPLES. THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES SPECIFIC STRATEGIES THAT RECENT PROJECTS HAVE USED THAT HAVE POTENTIAL FOR REALIZING DATA FEMINISM PRINCIPLES. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND/OR POLICY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGISTS CAN USE THE RE-ARTICULATED PRINCIPLES OF DATA FEMINISM FOR EDUCATION TO INFORM THEIR FUTURE DESIGN WORK. TRACTABLE STEPS TO ACHIEVE DATA JUSTICE THAT ARE ATTAINABLE WITHIN EXISTING EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS CAN BE PURSUED. COMMUNITIES CAN AND SHOULD BRING TOGETHER MULTIPLE WAYS OF KNOWING TO SUPPORT NEW EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES AND FUTURES WITH DATA.","DATA FEMINISM; DATA LITERACY; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; STATISTICS EDUCATION","CLASSROOM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ABRAHAMSON D, 2020, FRONT EDUC, V5, DOI 10.3389/FEDUC.2020.00147;AGESILAOU A., 2021, P 15 INT C LEARNING, P458;ANONYMOUS, 2021, GAPMINDER COMPUTER S;ANONYMOUS, 2021, SOCIAL EXPLORER COMP;BARSALOU LW, 1999, BEHAV BRAIN SCI, V22, P577, DOI 10.1017/S0140525X99532147;BARTON AC, 2021, AERA OPEN, V7, DOI 10.1177/23328584211041631;BASU S, 2020, SIGCSE 2020: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 51ST ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, P985, DOI 10.1145/3328778.3366881;BEN-ZVI D., 2017, INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH IN STATISTICS EDUCATION;BENJAMIN R., 2019, RACE AFTER TECHNOLOGY: ABOLITIONIST TOOLS FOR THE NEW JIM CODE;BHARGAVA R., 2016, THE JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY INFORMATICS, V12, DOI DOI 10.15353/JOCI.V12I3.3285;BHARGAVA RAHUL, 2015, WED SCI DAT LIT WORK;BÖRNER K, 2019, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V116, P1857, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.1807180116;BOWLER LEANNE, 2017, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, V54, DOI 10.1002/PRA2.2017.14505401004;BRANSFORD J.

FURTHER, THE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF LARGE-SCALE ELECTRONICALLY ACCESSIBLE DATA SETS IS AN UNTAPPED AREA OF STUDY. THIS INTERPRETIVE STUDY EXAMINED MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS' UNDERSTANDING OF STATISTICAL CONCEPTS INVOLVED IN MAKING A PLAN TO COLLECT DATA TO ANSWER A STATISTICAL QUESTION WITHIN A SOCIAL ISSUE CONTEXT USING DATA AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET. STUDENT ARTIFACTS, RESEARCHER NOTES, AND AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDINGS FROM NINE GROUPS OF 20 SEVENTH-GRADE STUDENTS IN TWO GIFTED EDUCATION PULL-OUT CLASSES AT A SUBURBAN MIDDLE SCHOOL WERE USED TO ANSWER THE STUDY RESEARCH QUESTIONS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING A PRIORI CODES FROM PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED FRAMEWORKS AND BY USING AN INDUCTIVE APPROACH TO FIND THEMES. THREE THEMES THAT EMERGED FROM DATA RELATED TO CONFIRMATION BIAS. SOME MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS HELD PRECONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SOCIAL ISSUES THEY CHOSE TO STUDY THAT BIASED THEIR STATISTICAL QUESTIONS. THIS IN TURN INFLUENCED THE SOURCES OF DATA STUDENTS USED TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS. CONFIRMATION BIAS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT IS EXACERBATED DUE TO ENDLESS SOURCES OF DATA ELECTRONICALLY AVAILABLE. WE ARGUE THAT THIS TYPE OF BIAS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED EARLY IN STUDENTS' EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES. BASED ON THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY, WE OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND IMPLICATIONS FOR STATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION.","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; MIDDLE SCHOOL; DATA COLLECTION; CONFIRMATION BIAS","STUDENTS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"AGRESTI A., 2017, STATISTICS: THE ART AND SCIENCE OF LEARNING FROM DATA, VFOURTH;AINLEY J., 2017, STAT ED RES J, V16, P15, DOI DOI 10.52041/SERJ.V16I2.183;ANONYMOUS, 2018, PUBLIC SCHOOL REVIEW;ANONYMOUS, 1985, NATURALISTIC INQUIRY, DOI DOI 10.1002/EV.1427;ARIDOR K, 2018, ZDM-MATH EDUC, V50, P1165, DOI 10.1007/S11858-018-0994-5;ARNOLD P.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: THE FEATURES OF TWO ONLINE DATA SCIENCE PLATFORMS ARE OUTLINED. BOTH ARE USEFUL FOR NEW DATA PROJECTS AND BOTH ARE INTEGRATED WITH COMMON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS. ONE PLATFORM FOCUSES MORE ON DATA EXPLORATION AND THE OTHER FOCUSES ON CONTAINERIZING, VISUALIZATION, AND SHARING CODE REPOSITORIES. RESULTS: BOTH DATA SCIENCE PLATFORMS ARE OPEN, FREE, AND ALLOW FOR COLLABORATION. BOTH ARE CAPABLE OF VISUAL, DESCRIPTIVE, AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS DISCUSSION: DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION BENEFITS BY HAVING AFFORDABLE OPEN AND COLLABORATIVE PLATFORMS TO CONDUCT A VARIETY OF DATA ANALYSES.

THE GROWING FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS MANY OF THESE NEEDS, PRIMARILY DUE TO RECENT EFFORTS TO COLLECT LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA RELATED TO SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND POLITICAL ISSUES. A CHALLENGE IS THAT THERE EXISTS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THESE REAL-WORLD ISSUES AND THE COURSE MATERIALS TAUGHT TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. THIS GAP IS DUE IN PART TO A LACK OF ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES AND THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, LEAVING STUDENTS WITH FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH DATASETS RELEVANT TO REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS. TO ADDRESS THIS DISCONNECT, THE AUTHORS HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NOVEL DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAM IN WHICH STUDENTS ACQUIRE NEW KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS WHILE CREATING POSITIVE SOCIAL IMPACT THROUGH COMMUNITY SERVICE.

THUS, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO REVEAL THE REALITY OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND TO DETERMINE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR TEACHING DATA SCIENCE IN THE REGION. THIRTEEN COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST WERE OFFERING 48 DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMES AT THE TIME OF THE STUDY. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT THESE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMES SIGNIFICANTLY USE THE WORDS 'DATA' AND 'ANALYTICS' IN THEIR NAMES. WITH REGARD TO THE ACADEMIC AFFILIATIONS OF THE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMES, THE STUDY FOUND THAT THEY ARE OFFERED IN A VARIETY OF SCHOOLS, ESPECIALLY COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS. MOREOVER, THE STUDY FOUND THAT COMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE DOMINANT TREND IN THE PROGRAMMES. DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP WITH OTHER PROGRAMMES, ESPECIALLY STATISTICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE, BECAUSE OF THE INTERDISCIPLINARY NATURE OF THIS FIELD. DATA SCIENCE SCHOOLS IN THE MIDDLE EAST DIFFER IN TERMS OF THEIR PROGRAMME TITLES, PROGRAMME DESCRIPTIONS, COURSE CATALOGUES, CURRICULUM STRUCTURES AND COURSE OBJECTIVES. BROADLY, THIS STUDY MAY BE USEFUL FOR THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING TO ESTABLISH A DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMME OR TO STRENGTHEN DATA SCIENCE CURRICULA AT BOTH THE UNDERGRADUATE AND POSTGRADUATE LEVELS.","DATA SCIENCE; DATA ANALYTICS; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; CURRICULUM ANALYSIS; MIDDLE EAST; ARABIAN GULF COUNTRIES","BIG DATA; ANALYTICS; LIBRARY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"AASHEIM C.L., 2015, J INFORM SYSTEMS ED, V26, P103;AGARWAL R, 2014, INFORM SYST RES, V25, P443, DOI 10.1287/ISRE.2014.0546;AHMAD K, 2019, DATA TECHNOL APPL, V53, P201, DOI 10.1108/DTA-09-2018-0085;ALARCON-SOTO Y., 2019, ARXIV;ANONYMOUS, GRAD DEGR PROGR AN D;ANONYMOUS, PROF DIPL BIG DAT DA;ANONYMOUS, 50 BEST JOBS AM 2022;ANONYMOUS, WORLD POPULATION REV;ANONYMOUS, 2018, NIH STRAT PLAN DAT S;ANONYMOUS, NEW MAST DEGR COMP E;ANONYMOUS, BACH DEGR DAT SCI AR;ANONYMOUS, MAST DAT SCI;ANONYMOUS, ABU DHABI SCH MANAGE;ARTANDI S., 1972, INTRO COMPUTERS INFO;BARLAS P, 2015, INT J INTELL COMPUT, V8, P232, DOI 10.1108/IJICC-07-2014-0031;BENNETT TD, 2019, J PEDIATR-US, V208, P12, DOI 10.1016/J.JPEDS.2018.12.041;BORNE KD., 2009, ARXIV;BUREAU ET., 2018, EC TIMES 0524;BUSSABAN K, 2015, PROCD SOC BEHV, V197, P1443, DOI 10.1016/J.SBSPRO.2015.07.092;CALZON B., 2021, DATAPINE BLOG;CAO L., 2018, DATA SCIENCE THINKING: THE NEXT SCIENTIFIC, TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, DATA ANALYTICS;CAO LB, 2017, ACM COMPUT SURV, V50, DOI 10.1145/3076253;CHEN HC, 2012, MIS QUART, V36, P1165;CHIU HW, 2018, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V154, PA1, DOI 10.1016/S0169-2607(17)31508-0;CLEVELAND WS, 2001, INT STAT REV, V69, P21, DOI 10.1111/J.1751-5823.2001.TB00477.X;COCHRAN J., 2018, PUBLIC MANAGEMENT AD, P1;CRUZ LP., 2017, P 9 INT JOINT C KNOW, P226;DAVENPORT TH, 2012, HARVARD BUS REV, V90, P70;DE VEAUX RD, 2017, ANNU REV STAT APPL, V4, P15, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV-STATISTICS-060116-053930;DHAR V, 2013, COMMUN ACM, V56, P64, DOI 10.1145/2500499;DIERICK HA, 2015, CURR BIOL, V25, PR606, DOI 10.1016/J.CUB.2015.05.019;DONOHO D, 2017, J COMPUT GRAPH STAT, V26, P745, DOI 10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734;EGGER R., 2022, APPL DATA SCI TOURIS, P35;EGGER R., 2022, APPL DATA SCI TOURIS;FAGHMOUS JH, 2014, BIG DATA, V2, P155, DOI 10.1089/BIG.2014.0026;FINZER W., 2013, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIO, V7, P1, DOI DOI 10.5070/T572013891;GAVRILOVA Y., 2021, SEROKELL BLOG;GERMAN UNIVERSITY IN CAIRO, 2022, DIPL DAT SCI;GIABBANELLI PJ, 2016, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V80, P1968, DOI 10.1016/J.PROCS.2016.05.517;GOLD M, 2013, BIG DATA, V1, P105, DOI 10.1089/BIG.2013.0009;GUTTA S., 2020, DATA SCI 5 VS BIG DA;HARRIS-PIERCE RL, 2012, NEW LIB WORLD, V113, P598, DOI 10.1108/03074801211282957;HOEL T., 2018, NORDIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION LITERACY IN HIGHER EDUCATION, V10, P4, DOI DOI 10.15845/NORIL.V10I1.269, 10.15845/NORIL.V10I1.269;HOYT R, 2018, JAMIA OPEN, V1, P159, DOI 10.1093/JAMIAOPEN/OOY040;JOHNSON JW, 2018, J COMPUTING SCI COLL, V33, P76;LOUKIDES M., 2012, WHAT IS DATA SCIENCE?;LOURIDAS P, 2013, IEEE SOFTWARE, V30, P33, DOI 10.1109/MS.2013.125;MALAS M., 2022, GLASSDOORS 3 BEST JO;MANI NS, 2021, J LIBR ADM, V61, P281, DOI 10.1080/01930826.2021.1883366;MANYIKA, 2011, BIG DATA NEXT FRONTI;MARCHIONINI G., 2016, JOURNAL OF DATA AND INFORMATION SCIENCE, V1, P1, DOI DOI 10.20309/JDIS.201609;MUKTHAR M.

FEATURE SELECTION, ENABLED BY RF, IS OFTEN AMONG THE VERY FIRST TASKS IN A DATA SCIENCE PROJECT, SUCH AS THE COLLEGE CAPSTONE PROJECT, INDUSTRY CONSULTING PROJECTS. THE GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF 12 RF-BASED FEATURE SELECTION METHODS FOR CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS. THE REVIEW PROVIDES NECESSARY DESCRIPTION OF EACH METHOD AND THE SOFTWARE PACKAGES. WE SHOW THAT DIFFERENT METHODS TYPICALLY DO NOT PROVIDE CONSISTENT FEATURE SELECTION RESULTS, AND THE MODEL PERFORMANCE ALSO VARIES WHEN DIFFERENT RF-BASED FEATURE SELECTION APPROACHES ARE EMPLOYED. THIS OBSERVATION SUGGESTS THAT CAUTION MUST BE TAKEN WHEN PERFORMING FEATURE SELECTION TASKS USING RF. FEATURE SELECTION CANNOT BE BLINDLY DONE WITHOUT A SOUND UNDERSTANDING OF THE METHODS ADOPTED, WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE IN INDUSTRY AND MANY SENIOR CAPSTONE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE OBSERVED. THE PAPER SERVES AS A ONE-STOP REFERENCE WHERE STUDENTS, DATA SCIENCE CONSULTANTS, ENGINEERS, AND DATA SCIENTISTS CAN ACCESS THE BASIC IDEAS BEHIND THESE METHODS, THE ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES, AS WELL AS THE SOFTWARE PACKAGES TO IMPLEMENT THESE METHODS.","RANDOM FOREST; FEATURE SELECTION; FEATURE IMPORTANCE; CLASSIFICATION; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; DATA SCIENCE CONSULTING PROJECTS; CAPSTONE PROJECTS","VARIABLE SELECTION; GENE SELECTION",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION","NO STATEMENT AVAILABLE","ALTMANN A, 2010, BIOINFORMATICS, V26, P1340, DOI 10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTQ134;KURSA MB, 2011, ARXIV, DOI ARXIV:1106.5112, 10.48550/ARXIV.1106.5112;BREIMAN L, 2001, MACH LEARN, V45, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:1010933404324;CAPSTONE, 2022, 6 ANN IND ENG CAPSTO;CELIK E., 2015, VITA: VARIABLE IMPORTANCE TESTING APPROACHES R PACKAGE VERSION 1.0.0;DENG HT, 2013, ARXIV, DOI ARXIV:1306.0237;DENG HT, 2012, IEEE IJCNN;DENG HT, 2013, PATTERN RECOGN, V46, P3483, DOI 10.1016/J.PATCOG.2013.05.018;DETZNER A, 2021, QUAL RELIAB ENG INT, V37, P335, DOI 10.1002/QRE.2738;DÍAZ-URIARTE R, 2006, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V7, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-7-3;DIAZ-URIARTE R, 2007, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V8, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-8-328;FOUODO C., 2022, POMONA: IDENTIFICATION OF RELEVANT VARIABLES IN OMICS DATA SETS USING RANDOM FORESTS R PACKAGE VERSION 1.0.2;FRANK A ..., 2010, UCI MACHINE LEARNING REPOSITORY;GENUER ROBIN, 2022, CRAN;GENUER R, 2015, R J, V7, P19;GORMAN RP, 1988, NEURAL NETWORKS, V1, P75, DOI 10.1016/0893-6080(88)90023-8;GUYON I, 2002, MACH LEARN, V46, P389, DOI 10.1023/A:1012487302797;GUYON I., 2003, JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH, V3, P1157, DOI 10.1162/153244303322753616;HASTIE T., 2009, THE ELEMENTS OF STATISTICAL LEARNING, V2ND ED, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7, 10.1007/ 978-0-387-84858-7;HOPKINS M., 1999, HEWLETT-PACKARD LABS, V1;HUA JP, 2005, BIOINFORMATICS, V21, P1509, DOI 10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTI171;ISHWARAN H, 2022, BREAST, V6, P1;ISHWARAN H, 2010, J AM STAT ASSOC, V105, P205, DOI 10.1198/JASA.2009.TM08622;JANITZA S, 2018, ADV DATA ANAL CLASSI, V12, P885, DOI 10.1007/S11634-016-0276-4;JIRAPECH-UMPAI T, 2005, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V6, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-6-148;KOHAVI R, 1997, ARTIF INTELL, V97, P273, DOI 10.1016/S0004-3702(97)00043-X;KUHN M, 2022, CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION TRAINING: PACKAGE CARET';KURSA MB, 2010, J STAT SOFTW, V36, P1, DOI 10.18637/JSS.V036.I11;LEE JW, 2005, COMPUT STAT DATA AN, V48, P869, DOI 10.1016/J.CSDA.2004.03.017;LIU HW, 2010, PATTERN RECOGN, V43, P2763, DOI 10.1016/J.PATCOG.2010.02.008;LIU X, 2021, J QUAL TECHNOL, V53, P545, DOI 10.1080/00224065.2021.1948373;LIU X, 2020, TECHNOMETRICS, V62, P206, DOI 10.1080/00401706.2019.1609584;CALLE ML, 2011, HUM HERED, V72, P121, DOI 10.1159/000330778;MAHAJAN S, 2023, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V82, P8213, DOI 10.1007/S11042-021-11474-Y;MANSOOR M, 2020, INF TECHNOL CONTROL, V49, P495, DOI 10.5755/J01.ITC.49.4.27118;PUDJIHARTONO N, 2022, FRONT BIOINFORM, V2, DOI 10.3389/FBINF.2022.927312;RUIZ R, 2006, PATTERN RECOGN, V39, P2383, DOI 10.1016/J.PATCOG.2005.11.001;SHAHEEN M, 2017, SCI REP-UK, V7, DOI 10.1038/SREP46108;SPEISER JL, 2019, EXPERT SYST APPL, V134, P93, DOI 10.1016/J.ESWA.2019.05.028;SZYMCZAK S, 2016, BIODATA MIN, V9, DOI 10.1186/S13040-016-0087-3;TAN P.-N., 2018, INTRODUCTION TO DATA MINING, VSECOND;TIN KAM HO, 1995, PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION, P278, DOI 10.1109/ICDAR.1995.598994;URREA V., 2012, AUCRF: VARIABLE SELECTION WITH RANDOM FOREST AND THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE R PACKAGE VERSION 1.1;WANG HONG, 2017, QUANT BIOSCI, V36, P85;WOLBERG WH, 1990, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V87, P9193, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.87.23.9193;ZHANG JP, 1992, MACHINE LEARNING /, P470;ZHU ZX, 2007, PATTERN RECOGN, V40, P3236, DOI 10.1016/J.PATCOG.2007.02.007","LIU, X (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), GEORGIA INST TECHNOL, H MILTON STEWART SCH IND & SYST ENGN, ATLANTA, GA 30332 USA.",NA,"SPRINGERNATURE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ENGLISH","INT.

THIS INCLUDES THE PRODUCTION OF THE SCHOOL AS AN INSTITUTION. A CRITICAL APPROACH TO EDUCATION THEREFORE MUST REINSCRIBE STUDENTS WITH THE ABILITY TO SEE WHAT EDUCATIONAL PROCESSES ATTEMPT TO HIDE AND TO CONSTRUCT AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE REAL FOR THEMSELVES. TO ILLUSTRATE THIS ARGUMENT, WE EXPLORE THE PRODUCTION OF VISUALITY WITHIN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AS ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW THE VISUAL MANIFESTS WITHIN SCHOOLS. IN RESPONSE, WE PROPOSE A VISUAL LITERACY INFORMED APPROACH TO ENGAGING STUDENTS WITH DATA, ONE THAT EXPANDS BEYOND CONTEMPORARY FORMS OF CRITICAL DATA LITERACY BY INVOLVING AN ONTOLOGICAL CRITIQUE OF EDUCATIONAL AESTHETICIZATION. TO GROUND THIS WORK, WE EXAMINE THE ROLE OF VISUALITY AND AESTHETICS WITHIN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CO-DESIGNED ARTS-INFUSED DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS IN FOUR US MIDDLE SCHOOLS. IN ANALYZING INTERVIEWS WITH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS, WE UNCOVER A SERIES OF TENSIONS THAT REVEAL THE ONGOING INFLUENCE OF SCHOOL VISUALITIES ALONGSIDE THE POTENTIAL FOR STUDENT GENERATED IMAGES TO AMPLIFY THEIR RIGHT TO LOOK. WE THEREFORE ARGUE THAT CRITICAL PEDAGOGIES MUST NOT ONLY INVOLVE READING AND CRITIQUING AESTHETIC ARTIFACTS BUT ALSO ENGAGE STUDENTS IN A CRITIQUE OF VISUALITY ITSELF.","VISUAL CULTURES; DATA LITERACY; VISUAL LITERACY; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; AESTHETICS; RIGHT TO LOOK",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [1908557, 1908142, 1908030]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE DISCOVERY RESEARCH K-12 AWARD [1908557, 1908142, 1908030].","ACKER A., 2018, HAW INT C SYST SCI 2;ALI-KHAN C, 2011, INT J QUAL STUD EDUC, V24, P303, DOI 10.1080/09518398.2011.554450;SANZ AA, 2019, VISUAL STUD, V34, P107, DOI 10.1080/1472586X.2019.1653223;ANONYMOUS, 2002, JOURNAL OF VISUAL LITERACY, DOI DOI 10.1080/23796529.2002.11674582;ATKINSON D., 2001, DISCOURSE STUDIES CU, V22, P67, DOI HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1080/01596300120039768, DOI 10.1080/01596300120039768;BROWN C W., 2022, JOURNAL OF VISUAL LITERACY, V41, P91, DOI DOI 10.1080/1051144X.2021.1994732, 10.1080/1051144X.2021.1994732;CHOE EK, 2015, IEEE COMPUT GRAPH, V35, P28, DOI 10.1109/MCG.2015.51;D'IGNAZIO CATHERINE, 2017, INFORMATION DESIGN JOURNAL, V23, P6, DOI 10.1075/IDJ.23.1.03DIG;DECUYPERE M, 2021, CRIT STUD EDUC, V62, P17, DOI 10.1080/17508487.2020.1720760;ERRÁZURIZ L, 2019, INT J EDUC ART, V15, P15, DOI 10.1386/ETA.15.1.15_1;FREIRE P., 2013, PEDAGOGY OPPRESSED;GIL-GLAZER Y, 2020, CRIT STUD EDUC, V61, P66, DOI 10.1080/17508487.2017.1292298;HANNIGAN A, 2023, PLOS ONE, V18, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0281749;HAROUNI H, 2015, HARVARD EDUC REV, V85, P50, DOI 10.17763/HAER.85.1.2Q580625188983P6;HARTONG S, 2021, CRIT STUD EDUC, V62, P34, DOI 10.1080/17508487.2020.1749861;HARTONG S, 2021, CRIT STUD EDUC, V62, P227, DOI 10.1080/17508487.2019.1618887;KENNEDY H, 2016, INFORM COMMUN SOC, V19, P715, DOI 10.1080/1369118X.2016.1153126;KNOCHEL A., 2013, VISUAL ARTS RES, V39, P13, DOI HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.5406/VISUARTSRESE.39.2.0013, DOI 10.5406/VISUARTSRESE.39.2.0013;LEE VR, 2021, EDUC RESEARCHER, DOI 10.3102/0013189X211048810;LEE VR., 2018, DATA USE BY MIDDLE AND SECONDARY STUDENTS IN THE DIGITAL AGE: A STATUS REPORT AND FUTURE PROSPECTS;MATUK C, 2022, BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL, V53, P1159, DOI 10.1111/BJET.13257;MIRZOEFF N, 2014, PUBLIC CULTURE, V26, P213, DOI 10.1215/08992363-2392039;MIRZOEFF N, 2011, CRIT INQUIRY, V37, P473, DOI 10.1086/659354;MIRZOEFF N., 1999, INTRODUCTION TO VISUAL CULTURE;NEWFIELD D, 2011, ENGL TEACH-PRACT CRI, V10, P81;NISSENBAUM H., 2015, OBFUSCATION USERS GU;PANGRAZIO L, 2022, HARVARD EDUC REV, V92, P257;PANGRAZIO L, 2020, LEARN MEDIA TECHNOL, V45, P208, DOI 10.1080/17439884.2020.1707223;PANGRAZIO L, 2019, NEW MEDIA SOC, V21, P419, DOI 10.1177/1461444818799523;PENUEL WR., 2007, RES PRACT TECH ENHAN, V2, P51, DOI DOI 10.1142/S1793206807000300;PERLMUTTER DD, 1997, J COMMUN, V47, P68, DOI 10.1111/J.1460-2466.1997.TB02717.X;PROSSER J., 2007, VISUAL STUDIES, V22, P13, DOI DOI 10.1080/14725860601167143;RANCIERE J, 2013, BLOOMSB REVELAT, P1;RANCIERE JACQUES., 2009, AESTHETICS AND ITS DISCONTENTS;RATNER H, 2019, BIG DATA SOC, V6, DOI 10.1177/2053951719853316;RUDOLPH JL, 2012, TECHNOL CULT, V53, P1;SALDANA J., 2015, THE CODING MANUAL FOR QUALITATIVE RESEARCHERS;SEGEL E, 2010, IEEE T VIS COMPUT GR, V16, P1139, DOI 10.1109/TVCG.2010.179;SELLAR S, 2015, CRIT STUD EDUC, V56, P131, DOI 10.1080/17508487.2015.981198;SELWYN N, 2022, BRIT J EDUC STUD, V70, P345, DOI 10.1080/00071005.2021.1925085;STORNAIUOLO A, 2020, J LEARN SCI, V29, P81, DOI 10.1080/10508406.2019.1689365;TYGEL A.

AS EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS INCREASINGLY ADOPT DATA SCIENCE CURRICULA FOR K-12 STUDENTS, THE NEED FOR SCALABLE, PERSONALIZED TEACHING TOOLS BECOMES CRITICAL. WHILE THE INTEGRATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS) IN EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS OFFERS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR SCALABILITY AND AUTOMATION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE GENERATED LANGUAGE OUTPUT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE HIGHLY SUITABLE FOR K-12 STUDENTS. IN THIS PAPER, WE INTRODUCE THE DSRAG, A NOVEL EDUCATIONAL AUTOMATIC FEEDBACK GENERATION FRAMEWORK THAT LEVERAGES RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG) AND CLOUD-BASED LLMS TO PROVIDE AUTOMATED AND PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK FOR K-12 STUDENTS ENGAGED IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. DSRAG EMPLOYS LANGCHAIN QUESTION-ANSWERING AND RAG SYSTEMS TO MANAGE EDUCATIONAL CONTENT AND GENERATE FEEDBACK ON THE TOP OF GPT-4.

THESE PROCESSES STRONGLY INFLUENCE THE ANALYTICAL METHODS THAT CAN BE APPLIED, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW THE RESULTS OF THOSE METHODS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED. IN THE PRESENT CHAPTER WE PROVIDE BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES FOR DATA SCIENTISTS AND REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF A WORKSHOP WHERE EXPERTS FROM THE INFORMATION FIELD BRAINSTORMED ON THE EDUCATIONAL DIMENSIONS OF DATA SCIENCE. RESULTS OF THE WORKSHOP SHOWED THAT DATA SCIENTISTS MUST POSSESS A BREADTH OF EXPERTISE ACROSS THREE AREAS - CURATION, ANALYTICS, AND CYBER-INFRASTRUCTURE WITH DEEP KNOWLEDGE IN AT LEAST ONE OF THESE AREAS. WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS ALSO UNDERSCORED THE IMPORTANCE OF DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE DATA SCIENCE ROLE.

CONCISELY, STUDENTS WERE GIVEN HANDS-ON OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPLORE THE BIOINFORMATICS-BASED ANALYSES OF BIOMOLECULAR DATA AND STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY VIA A SEMESTER-LONG CASE STUDY STRUCTURED AS INQUIRY-BASED BIOINFORMATICS EXERCISES. TOWARDS THE END OF THE TERM, THE STUDENTS ALSO DESIGNED AND PRESENTED AN ASSIGNMENT PROJECT THAT ALLOWED THEM TO DOCUMENT THE UNKNOWN PROTEIN THAT THEY IDENTIFIED USING BIOINFORMATIC KNOWLEDGE DURING THE TERM.RESULTS THE POST-MODULE SURVEY RESPONSES AND STUDENTS' PERFORMANCES IN THE LAB MODULE IMPLY THAT IT FURTHERED AN IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF BIOINFORMATICS.

PRIOR WORK ON SIMILAR AI MODELS HAS SHOWN THAT THEY PERFORM WELL ON TYPICAL INTRO-LEVEL COMPUTER SCIENCE PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH TOOLS ON DATA SCIENCE (DS) PROBLEMS. IN THIS WORK, WE ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF CHATGPT ON ASSIGNMENTS FROM THREE DS COURSES WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY LEVELS. FIRST, WE APPLY THE RAW ASSIGNMENT PROMPTS PROVIDED TO THE STUDENTS AND FIND THAT CHATGPT PERFORMS WELL ON ASSIGNMENTS WITH DATASET(S) DESCRIPTIONS AND PROGRESSIVE QUESTION PROMPTS, WHICH DIVIDE THE PROGRAMMING REQUIREMENTS INTO SUB-PROBLEMS. THEN, WE PERFORM PROMPT ENGINEERING ON THE ASSIGNMENTS FOR WHICH CHATGPT HAD LOW PERFORMANCE. WE FIND THAT THE FOLLOWING PROMPT ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED CHATGPT'S PERFORMANCE: BREAKING DOWN ABSTRACT QUESTIONS INTO STEPS, BREAKING DOWN STEPS INTO MULTIPLE PROMPTS, PROVIDING DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DATASET(S), INCLUDING ALGORITHMIC DETAILS, ADDING SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS TO ENTICE SPECIFIC ACTIONS, AND REMOVING EXTRANEOUS INFORMATION.

TRAINING HEALTHCARE SPECIALISTS WHO ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN BOTH HEALTH AND DATA SCIENCES IS HIGHLY REQUIRED, IMPORTANT, AND CHALLENGING. THEREFORE, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ANALYSE STUDENTS' LEARNING EXPERIENCES THROUGH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE BOTH TEACHERS AND LEARNERS WITH INSIGHTS ABOUT EFFECTIVE LEARNING STRATEGIES AND TO IMPROVE EXISTING HDS COURSE DESIGNS.METHODS WE APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHODS TO UNCOVER LEARNING TACTICS AND STRATEGIES EMPLOYED BY STUDENTS IN AN HDS MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSE WITH OVER 3,000 STUDENTS ENROLLED. WE ALSO USED STATISTICAL TESTS TO EXPLORE STUDENTS' ENGAGEMENT WITH DIFFERENT RESOURCES (SUCH AS READING MATERIALS AND LECTURE VIDEOS) AND THEIR LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT WITH VARIOUS HDS TOPICS.RESULTS WE FOUND THAT STUDENTS IN HDS EMPLOYED FOUR LEARNING TACTICS, SUCH AS ACTIVELY CONNECTING NEW INFORMATION TO THEIR PRIOR KNOWLEDGE, TAKING ASSESSMENTS AND PRACTISING PROGRAMMING TO EVALUATE THEIR UNDERSTANDING, COLLABORATING WITH THEIR CLASSMATES, AND REPEATING INFORMATION TO MEMORISE. BASED ON THE EMPLOYED TACTICS, WE ALSO FOUND THREE TYPES OF LEARNING STRATEGIES, INCLUDING LOW ENGAGEMENT (SURFACE LEARNERS), MODERATE ENGAGEMENT (STRATEGIC LEARNERS), AND HIGH ENGAGEMENT (DEEP LEARNERS), WHICH ARE IN LINE WITH WELL-KNOWN EDUCATIONAL THEORIES. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS ALLOCATE MORE TIME TO PRACTICAL TOPICS, SUCH AS PROJECTS AND DISCUSSIONS, MAKE CONNECTIONS AMONG CONCEPTS, AND EMPLOY PEER LEARNING.CONCLUSIONS WE APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES TO PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO HDS EDUCATION.

HOWEVER, POSTSECONDARY TRAINING IN BIOINFORMATICS, OR MORE GENERALLY DATA SCIENCE FOR LIFE SCIENTISTS, LAGS BEHIND CURRENT DEMAND. IN PARTICULAR, DEVELOPMENT OF ACCESSIBLE, UNDERGRADUATE DATA SCIENCE CURRICULA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE RESEARCH AND LEARNING OUTCOMES AS WELL AS BETTER PREPARE STUDENTS IN THE LIFE SCIENCES TO THRIVE IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR CAREERS. HERE, WE DESCRIBE THE EXPERIENTIAL DATA SCIENCE FOR UNDERGRADUATE CROSS-DISCIPLINARY EDUCATION (EDUCE) INITIATIVE, WHICH AIMS TO PROGRESSIVELY BUILD DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCY ACROSS SEVERAL YEARS OF INTEGRATED PRACTICE. THROUGH EDUCE, STUDENTS COMPLETE DATA SCIENCE MODULES INTEGRATED INTO REQUIRED AND ELECTIVE COURSES AUGMENTED WITH COORDINATED COCURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. THE EDUCE INITIATIVE DRAWS ON A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE CONSISTING OF TEACHING ASSISTANTS (TAS), POSTDOCS, INSTRUCTORS, AND RESEARCH FACULTY FROM MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES TO OVERCOME SEVERAL REPORTED BARRIERS TO DATA SCIENCE FOR LIFE SCIENTISTS, INCLUDING INSTRUCTOR CAPACITY, STUDENT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE, AND RELEVANCE TO DISCIPLINE-SPECIFIC PROBLEMS.

RECENT EFFORTS TO PROMOTE REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH MAINLY FOCUSED ON MATURED SCIENTISTS AND MUCH LESS ON STUDENT TRAINING. IN THIS STUDY, WE CONDUCTED ACTION RESEARCH ON STUDENTS IN DATA SCIENCE TO EVALUATE TO WHAT EXTENT STUDENTS ARE READY FOR COMMUNICATING REPRODUCIBLE DATA ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ALTHOUGH TWO-THIRDS OF THE STUDENTS CLAIMED THEY WERE ABLE TO REPRODUCE RESULTS IN PEER REPORTS, ONLY ONE-THIRD OF REPORTS PROVIDED ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION FOR REPLICATION. THE ACTUAL REPLICATION RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE CONFLICTING CLAIMS; SOME LACKED COMPARISONS OF ORIGINAL AND REPLICATION RESULTS, INDICATING THAT SOME STUDENTS DID NOT SHARE A CONSISTENT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT REPRODUCIBILITY MEANS AND HOW TO REPORT REPLICATION RESULTS.

HENCE, IT IS NECESSARY TO DESIGN EFFICIENT EDUCATION TECHNIQUES TO RAPIDLY TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF STUDENTS. WE DESCRIBE A HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT INTEGRATES MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES WITHIN A SINGLE SEMESTER COURSE TAUGHT AT THE FIRST YEAR LEVEL. THE OBJECTIVES INCLUDE BASIC DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, TEAMWORK, AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT. WE CONDUCTED A PROJECT THAT COMBINED DIFFERENT PUBLIC DATASETS RELATED TO THE COST AND QUALITY OF EDUCATION IN THE US. STUDENTS DEMONSTRATED A HIGH DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT IN THIS EXERCISE AS THEY WERE CURIOUS TO EXPLORE DATA THAT RELATED TO THEIR OWN COLLEGE SELECTION PROCESS. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO PERFORM A COST-QUALITY ANALYSIS IN THE FIELD OF COLLEGE EDUCATION. WE USED COLLEGE RANKING DATA CREATED BY THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, AND COMBINED IT WITH DATA FROM THE INTEGRATED POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION DATA SYSTEM DATABASE (HTTPS://NCES.ED.GOVIIPEDS/) THAT PROVIDED COLLEGE COSTS AND GRADUATION DATA. STUDENTS WORKED IN TEAMS TO DOWNLOAD SECTIONS OF THE DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, PERFORMED CLEANING AND VERIFICATION, AND MERGED THE DATA FOR ANALYSIS. THIS TAUGHT THEM THE VALUES OF TEAMWORK, GOAL-SETTING, AND PROCESS MEASUREMENT FOR TIMELY PROJECT COMPLETION. WE DETERMINED THAT THE PEARSON CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RANK OF A COLLEGE AND IN-STATE TUITION WAS -0.65 (P<0.005) FOR PRIVATE COLLEGES, AND -0.34 (P<0.005) FOR PUBLIC COLLEGES. THIS INDICATES THAT HIGHER RANKED COLLEGES TEND TO CHARGE HIGHER TUITION. THE PEARSON CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RANK OF ALL COLLEGES AND THEIR GRADUATION RATES IS -0.75 (P<0.005), AND BETWEEN RANK AND RETENTION RATES IS -0.71 (P<0.005). PRIVATE COLLEGE TUITION IS TYPICALLY $40,000 ANNUALLY, WHEREAS PUBLIC COLLEGES COST $20,000. THESE FIGURES SUGGEST THAT PUBLIC COLLEGES PROVIDE GOOD VALUE.

A REAL-LIFE CASE STUDY OF A HACKATHON FOR COLLEGE PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS OF A UNIVERSITY DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMME IS DEMONSTRATED. THE UNIVERSITY-INDUSTRY COLLABORATIVE APPROACH OF THE HACKATHON PROVIDES SEVERAL BENEFITS FOR ITS STAKEHOLDERS, NAMELY PROMOTING THE REPUTATION AND RECOGNITION OF THE UNIVERSITY'S DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMME; OFFERING CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE ENTERPRISE'S WORKPLACE PROBLEMS; ENCOURAGING THE ADOPTION OF THE TECHNOLOGY VENDOR'S PLATFORM, AND FINALLY, ENHANCING THE TEACHING AND LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR THE COLLEGE STUDENTS AND LECTURERS.

TO ADDRESS THE SHORTFALL, ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS SHOULD INCORPORATE INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE INTO GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES. A GENERAL EDUCATION IT COURSE PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO INTEGRATE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. MODULES COVERING DATABASES, SPREADSHEETS, AND PRESENTATION SOFTWARE, ALREADY PRESENT IN MANY SURVEY IT COURSES, TEACH CONCEPTS AND SKILLS NEEDED FOR DATA SCIENCE. AS A RESULT, A SURVEY IT COURSE CAN PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION BY ADDING A DATA SCIENCE MODULE FOCUSED ON MODELING AND EVALUATION, TWO KEY STEPS IN THE DATA SCIENCE PROCESS. THE MODULE SHOULD USE DATA SCIENCE SOFTWARE FOR APPLICATION, AVOIDING THE COMPLEXITIES OF PROGRAMMING AND ADVANCED MATH, WHILE ENABLING AN EMPHASIS ON CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING.

THESE NEW TRENDS IMPACT THE SOCIETY AND FUTURE JOBS, AND THUS STUDENT CAREERS. AT THE HEART OF THIS DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IS DATA SCIENCE, THE DISCIPLINE THAT MAKES SENSE OF BIG DATA. WITH MANY RAPIDLY EMERGING DIGITAL CHALLENGES AHEAD OF US, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES PERSPECTIVES ON ISCHOOLS' OPPORTUNITIES AND SUGGESTIONS IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. WE ARGUE THAT ISCHOOLS SHOULD EMPOWER THEIR STUDENTS WITH ""INFORMATION COMPUTING"" DISCIPLINES, WHICH WE DEFINE AS THE ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND CREATE VALUES, INFORMATION, AND KNOWLEDGE USING TOOLS IN APPLICATION DOMAINS. AS SPECIFIC APPROACHES TO ENFORCING INFORMATION COMPUTING DISCIPLINES IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, WE SUGGEST THE THREE FOCI OF USER-BASED, TOOL-BASED, AND APPLICATION-BASED. THESE THREE FOCI WILL SERVE TO DIFFERENTIATE THE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION OF ISCHOOLS FROM THAT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE OR BUSINESS SCHOOLS. WE PRESENT A LAYERED DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION FRAMEWORK (DSEF) WITH BUILDING BLOCKS THAT INCLUDE THE THREE PILLARS OF DATA SCIENCE (PEOPLE, TECHNOLOGY, AND DATA), COMPUTATIONAL THINKING, DATA-DRIVEN PARADIGMS, AND DATA SCIENCE LIFECYCLES. DATA SCIENCE COURSES BUILT ON THE TOP OF THIS FRAMEWORK SHOULD THUS BE EXECUTED WITH USER-BASED, TOOL-BASED, AND APPLICATION-BASED APPROACHES. THIS FRAMEWORK WILL HELP OUR STUDENTS THINK ABOUT DATA SCIENCE PROBLEMS FROM THE BIG PICTURE PERSPECTIVE AND FOSTER APPROPRIATE PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS IN CONJUNCTION WITH BROAD PERSPECTIVES OF DATA SCIENCE LIFECYCLES.

THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE POTENTIAL USE OF CHATGPT, A GENERATIVE AI TOOL, IN PROVIDING PERSONALIZED LEARNING EXPERIENCES FOR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON DEEP LEARNING. THE PAPER PRESENTS A CASE STUDY THAT APPLIES THE 5ES MODEL TO TEST PERSONALIZED LEARNING FOR STUDENTS USING CHATGPT. THE STUDY AIMS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF HOW EDUCATORS CAN LEVERAGE CHATGPT IN THEIR PEDAGOGY TO ENHANCE STUDENT LEARNING, AND WHETHER CHATGPT CAN PROVIDE A BETTER LEARNING EXPERIENCE THAN TRADITIONAL TEACHING METHODS. THE PAPER ALSO DISCUSSES THE LIMITATIONS FACED DURING THE STUDY AND THE FINDINGS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CHATGPT CAN BE A VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, PROVIDING PERSONALIZED AND INSTANT FEEDBACK TO LEARNERS. HOWEVER, ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS THE POTENTIAL FOR BIASED OR INACCURATE RESPONSES AND THE NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY IN AI-GENERATED CONTENT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY AD-DRESSED BY EDUCATORS. THE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS CHATGPT'S POTENTIAL AS A RESEARCH TOOL FOR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATORS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AI IN PERSONALIZED LEARNING EXPERIENCES. OVERALL, THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE ONGOING DIALOGUE ON THE ROLE OF AI IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO HOW EDUCATORS CAN UTILIZE CHATGPT TO ENHANCE STUDENT LEARNING AND ENGAGEMENT.","PERSONALIZED LEARNING; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; CHATGPT; GENERATIVE AI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"AÇISLI S, 2011, PROCD SOC BEHV, V15, P2459, DOI 10.1016/J.SBSPRO.2011.04.128;BASHAM JD, 2016, J SPEC EDUC TECHNOL, V31, P126, DOI 10.1177/0162643416660835;BISWAS S., 2023, PROSPECTIVE ROLE OF CHAT GPT IN THE MILITARY: ACCORDING TO CHATGPT, DOI 10.32388/8WYYOD, DOI 10.32388/8WYYOD;BISWAS SS, 2023, ANN BIOMED ENG, V51, P868, DOI 10.1007/S10439-023-03172-7;BISWAS SS, 2023, ANN BIOMED ENG, V51, P1126, DOI 10.1007/S10439-023-03171-8;BRUSTENGA G., 2018, BRIEFNG PAPER: CHATBOTS IN EDUCATION;CHEN HL, 2020, J EDUC COMPUT RES, V58, P1161, DOI 10.1177/0735633120929622;COLACE F., 2018, INT.

ALTHOUGH ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS HAVE THE ABILITY TO REFLECT CULTURAL PRIORITIES, A SINGULAR VIEW OF ETHICS, AS WE EXPLORE, OFTEN FAILS TO SPEAK TO THE MULTIPLE AND DIVERSE PRIORITIES HELD BOTH WITHIN AND ACROSS INSTITUTIONAL SPACES. TO THAT END, THIS PAPER EXPLORES MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES, EPISTEMOLOGIES, AND WORLDVIEWS THAT CAN COLLECTIVELY PUSH RESEARCHERS TOWARDS CONSIDERATIONS OF A DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION THAT IS EQUITY -MINDED BOTH IN CONCEPT AND PRACTICE. THROUGH A SET OF DIALOGUES WHICH EXAMINE OUR POSITIONALITIES, JOURNEYS, ETHICS, LOCAL CULTURES, AND ACCOUNTABILITIES, THIS PA-PER EXPLORES THE CONTEXTUAL REALITIES ROOTED IN THE AUTHORS' EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS. THESE CONVERSATIONS FOCUS ON THE HUMANITY OF OUR STUDENTS, THE COMMUNITIES FROM WHICH WE COME FROM AND SERVE, AS WELL AS THE UNINTENTIONAL HARMS AND POSSIBILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS ACROSS INSTITUTIONAL TYPES. WE TAKE A SET OF FIVE CORE QUESTIONS TO EXAMINE HOW WE MADE, AND CONTINUE TO MAKE, SENSE OF OUR DIVERSE CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES ON DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND EQUITY WITH/IN RELATION TO OTHERS' REALITIES. BROADLY, THIS PAPER SEEKS TO OFFER REFLECTIONS ON THE RELATED BUT DIFFERING FUNCTIONS OF ETHICS AND EQUITY IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION.","DATA ETHICS; EQUITY; DATA SCIENCE; EDUCATION; SOCIAL JUSTICE","MATHEMATICS EDUCATION; CURRICULUM; STATISTICS; PROGRAMS; STUDENTS; BLACK; RACE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ADIREDJA AP., 2017, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN UNDERGRADUATE MATHEMATICS EDUCATION, V3, P444, DOI DOI 10.1007/S40753-017-0054-5;ALEXANDER N.N., 2019, PRIMUS, V29, P396, DOI DOI 10.1080/10511970.2018, 10.1080/10511970.2018;AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIAITION (ASA), 2014, CURRICULUM GUIDELINE;ANONYMOUS, 2011, BIG DATA NEXT FRONTI;ARCHIBALD J.-A., 2019, DECOLONIZING RES IND;ASSOCIATED PRESS (AP), 2020, EXPLAINING AP STYLE ON BLACK AND WHITE;ASSOCIATION OF COMPUTING MACHINES (ACM) AND INSTITUTE ELECTRICAL & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERS (IEEE), 2013, COMPUTER SCI CURRICU;BAKHTIN M.

WE ILLUSTRATE NWFAR THROUGH TWO DESIGN-BASED RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM PRIOR EMPIRICAL WORK.

SUSTAINABLE DATASETS SHOULD BE REUSABLE, ADAPTABLE, AND ACCESSIBLE TO SUPPORT LONG-TERM AI AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION GOALS. HOWEVER, RESEARCH ON THE SYSTEMATIC CATEGORIZATION OF DIFFICULTY LEVELS IN EDUCATIONAL DATASETS IS LIMITED. THIS STUDY AIMS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP BY DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK FOR SUSTAINABLE EDUCATIONAL DATASET STANDARDS BASED ON LEARNERS' DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES AND DATA PREPROCESSING REQUIREMENTS. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK CONSISTS OF FIVE LEVELS: LEVEL 1 (GRADES 1-4), WHERE DATA PREPROCESSING IS UNNECESSARY; LEVEL 2 (GRADES 5-6), INVOLVING BASIC DATA CLEANING; LEVEL 3 (GRADES 7-9), REQUIRING ATTRIBUTE MANIPULATION; LEVEL 4 (GRADES 10-12), INVOLVING FEATURE MERGING AND ADVANCED PREPROCESSING; AND LEVEL 5 (TEACHERS/ADULTS), REQUIRING THE ENTIRE DATA SCIENCE PROCESS. AN EXPERT VALIDITY SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED WITH 22 ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS HOLDING ADVANCED DEGREES IN AI EDUCATION. THE RESULTS SHOWED HIGH VALIDITY FOR LEVELS 1-4 BUT RELATIVELY LOWER VALIDITY FOR LEVEL 5, SUGGESTING THE NEED FOR SEPARATE TRAINING AND RESOURCES FOR TEACHERS. BASED ON THE CVR RESULTS AND EXPERT FEEDBACK, THE STANDARDS FOR EDUCATIONAL DATASETS WERE REVISED, PARTICULARLY FOR STAGE 5, WHICH TARGETS TEACHERS AND ADULT LEARNERS. THE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPERT VALIDATION, STEP-BY-STEP EXPERIENCES, AND AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH IN DEVELOPING EDUCATIONAL DATASETS. THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF EDUCATIONAL DATASETS AND PROVIDES PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHERS, STUDENTS, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND POLICYMAKERS IN IMPLEMENTING EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE AI AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IN K-12 SETTINGS, ULTIMATELY FOSTERING A MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE.","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; DATA SCIENCE; SUSTAINABLE EDUCATION; AI EDUCATION; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; EDUCATIONAL DATASETS; EXPERT VALIDITY; K-12 EDUCATION","ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"AGARWAL S., UNDERSTANDING THE DATA SCIENCE LIFECYCLE;AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION, 2024, TEACHING DATA SCIENCE IN HIGH SCHOOL: ENHANCING OPPORTUNITIES AND SUCCESS;BANCHI H., 2008, SCIENCE AND CHILDREN, V46, P26, DOI DOI 10.1111/J.1600-065X.2008.00760.X.SHP-1;BUCEA-MANEA-TONIS R, 2022, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V14, DOI 10.3390/SU14105842;CHIU TKF, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V12, DOI 10.3390/SU12145568;CLARK J.

THE TOOLS USED TO TEACH DATA SCIENCE PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN SHAPING THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CAREFULLY CHOOSE WHICH TOOLS TO USE TO INTRODUCE LEARNERS TO DATA SCIENCE. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF 30 DATA SCIENCE TOOLS THAT ARE, OR DESIGNED TO BE, USED IN INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION FOR K-12 STUDENTS. THE IDENTIFIED TOOLS LIST INCLUDES SPREADSHEETS, VISUAL ANALYSIS TOOLS, AND SCRIPTING ENVIRONMENTS. FOR EACH TOOL, WE EXAMINE FACETS OF ITS CAPABILITIES, INTERACTIONS, EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT, AND ACCESSIBILITY. FOR BLOCK-BASED PROGRAMMING TOOLS, WE ALSO EXAMINE THE DATA SCIENCE FUNCTIONALITIES AVAILABLE IN THAT TOOL'S BLOCKS.

IT IS ESSENTIAL THEY LEARN BY WORKING ON ASSIGNMENTS THAT INVOLVE REAL WORLD DATA SETS TO DEVELOP THE SKILLS NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE WORKPLACE. HOWEVER, ENABLING INSTRUCTORS TO FLEXIBLY DELIVER ALL KINDS OF DATA SCIENCE ASSIGNMENTS USING REAL WORLD DATA SETS TO LARGE NUMBERS OF LEARNERS (BOTH ON-CAMPUS AND OFF-CAMPUS) AT LOW COST IS A SIGNIFICANT OPEN CHALLENGE. TO ADDRESS THIS EMERGING CHALLENGE GENERALLY, WE DEVELOP AND DEPLOY A NOVEL CLOUD-BASED LAB FOR DATA SCIENCE (CLADS) TO ENABLE MANY LEARNERS AROUND THE WORLD TO WORK ON REAL-WORLD DATA SCIENCE PROBLEMS WITHOUT HAVING TO MOVE OR OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTE PROHIBITIVELY LARGE DATA SETS. LEVERAGING VERSION CONTROL AND CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION, CLADS PROVIDES A GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE ANY INSTRUCTOR TO CONVENIENTLY DELIVER ANY HANDS-ON DATA SCIENCE ASSIGNMENT THAT USES LARGE REAL WORLD DATA SETS TO AS MANY LEARNERS AS OUR CLOUD-COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE ALLOWS AT VERY LOW COST. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CLADS AND DISCUSS OUR EXPERIENCE WITH USING CLADS TO DEPLOY SEVEN MAJOR TEXT DATA ASSIGNMENTS FOR STUDENTS IN BOTH AN ON-CAMPUS COURSE AND AN ONLINE COURSE TO WORK ON FOR LEARNING ABOUT TEXT DATA RETRIEVAL AND MINING TECHNIQUES; THIS SHOWS THAT CLADS IS A VERY PROMISING NOVEL GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EFFICIENTLY DELIVERING A WIDE RANGE OF HANDS-ON DATA SCIENCE ASSIGNMENTS TO A LARGE NUMBER OF LEARNERS AT VERY LOW COST.","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION;

IN THIS PAPER, WE REPORT ON SOME OF THE EXERCISES DONE IN ANALYZING CURRENT DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION OFFER AND MATCHING WITH THE NEEDS OF THE JOB MARKETS TO PROPOSE A SCALABLE MATCHING SERVICE, IE, COMPETENCIES CLASSIFICATION (E-CO-2), BASED ON DATA SCIENCE TECHNIQUES. THE E-CO-2 SERVICE CAN HELP TO EXTRACT RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM DATA SCIENCE-RELATED DOCUMENTS (COURSE DESCRIPTIONS, JOB ADS, BLOGS, OR PAPERS), WHICH ENABLE THE COMPARISON OF THE DEMAND AND OFFER IN THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND HR MANAGEMENT, ULTIMATELY HELPING TO ESTABLISH THE PROFESSION OF DATA SCIENTIST.","CAREER DEVELOPMENT; DATA SCIENCE; DATA SCIENCE JOB MARKET; EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EUROPEAN UNION'S HORIZON 2020 RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMME [675419]","EUROPEAN UNION'S HORIZON 2020 RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMME, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: 675419","ANONYMOUS, 1995, P 33 ANN M ASS COMP;ANONYMOUS, 2006, HICSS;ANONYMOUS, INT J DIGITAL LIB, DOI 10.1007/S007999900023;ANONYMOUS, 2005, ONTOLOGY LEARNING TE;ANONYMOUS, 2015, NIST BIG DATA INTERO, DOI DOI 10.6028/NIST.SP.1500-1;BAR N, 2014, THESIS;BOLLINGER J, 2012, P 2012 WORKSH DAT DR;EDISON, 2017, EDSF 1;EDISON, DAT SCI ED PROGR INV;FALIAGKA E., 2012, 7 INT C INT WEB APPL;HATZIVASSILOGLOU V., 2000, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL ACM SIGIR CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION RETRIEVAL;HEE K, 2016, P 8 IEEE INT C WORKS;HIEMSTRA D, 2010, MIREX MAPREDUCE INFO;HIEMSTRA D, 2010, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V6360, P64, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-15998-5_8;JAIN AK, 2010, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V31, P651, DOI 10.1016/J.PATREC.2009.09.011;JOHNSON SC, 1967, PSYCHOMETRIKA, V32, P241, DOI 10.1007/BF02289588;KALVA T.R., 2013, SKILL FINDER AUTOMAT;KERSTEN PR, 2005, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V43, P519, DOI 10.1109/TGRS.2004.842108;KESSLER R, 2012, INFORM PROCESS MANAG, V48, P1124, DOI 10.1016/J.IPM.2012.03.002;LIN J., 2010, DATA INTENSIVE TEXT;MANIERI A, 2015, 2015 IEEE 7 INT C CL;MAYBERRY T, 2016, FINANCIAL CRYPTOGRAP, P371;MAYNARD D, 2008, FRONT ARTIF INTEL AP, V167, P107;MENCZER F, 2004, J AM SOC INF SCI TEC, V55, P1261, DOI 10.1002/ASI.20081;MIHALCEA R, 2010, ENCY MACHINE LEARNIN, P1027;MUKALA P, 2015, P 5 INT S DAT DRIV P;NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY, 2015, NIST BIG DAT INT FRA, V6, DOI 10.6028/NIST.SP.1500-6, DOI 10.6028/NIST.SP.1500-6;NAVIGLI R., 2010, P 48 ANN M ASS COMP;PAZIENZA M.

THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE ON DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION BY EXAMINING THE SOCIOTECHNICAL PRACTICES OF DATA WRANGLING-STRATEGIES FOR SELECTING AND MANAGING LARGE, AGGREGATED DATASETS TO PRODUCE A MODEL AND STORY. WE EXAMINED THE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO DATA WRANGLING PRACTICES BY INVESTIGATING YOUTH'S TALK-IN-INTERACTION WHILE ASSEMBLING MODELS AND STORIES ABOUT FAMILY MIGRATION USING INTERACTIVE DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS AND LARGE SOCIOECONOMIC DATASETS. WE FIRST IDENTIFIED TEN SOCIOTECHNICAL PRACTICES THAT CHARACTERIZE YOUTH'S INTERACTION WITH TOOLS AND COLLABORATION IN DATA WRANGLING. WE THEN SUGGEST FOUR CATEGORIES OF ACTIVITIES TO DESCRIBE PATTERNS OF LEARNING RELATED TO THE PRACTICES, INCLUDING ADDRESSING MISSING DATA, UNDERSTANDING DATA AGGREGATION, EXPLORING SOCIAL OR HISTORICAL EVENTS THAT CONSTITUTE THE FORMATION OF DATA PATTERNS, AND VARYING DATA VISUAL ENCODING FOR STORYTELLING. THESE PRACTICES AND ACTIVITIES ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND FOR SUPPORTING FUTURE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES THAT FACILITATE LEARNING AND DISCUSSION ABOUT SCIENTIFIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC ISSUES. THIS STUDY ALSO SHEDS LIGHT ON HOW THE FAMILY MIGRATION MODELING CONTEXT POSITIONS THE YOUTH AS HAVING AGENCY AND AUTHORITY OVER THE DATA AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE DESIGN OF CSCL ENVIRONMENTS THAT TACKLE THE CHALLENGES OF DATA WRANGLING.","DATA WRANGLING; MODELING; STORYTELLING; FAMILY MIGRATION; DATA VISUALIZATION; SOCIOTECHNICAL PRACTICES","ENGAGEMENT; CLASSROOM; STORIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [1341882]; DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR; DIV OF INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS [1341882] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION UNDER GRANT NUMBER 1341882.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH NEW DATA SCIENTISTS ARE TRAINED SHOULD MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THAT IN WHICH THEY WILL EVENTUALLY PRACTICE, AND WE PROPOSE HERE A DATA SCIENCE MASTER'S DEGREE PROGRAM THAT TAKES INSPIRATION FROM THE RESIDENCY MODEL USED IN MEDICINE. STUDENTS IN THE SUGGESTED PROGRAM WOULD SPEND THEIR TIME WORKING ON A PRACTICAL PROBLEM WITH AN INDUSTRY, GOVERNMENT, OR NONPROFIT PARTNER, SUPPLEMENTED WITH COURSEWORK IN DATA SCIENCE METHODS AND THEORY. WE ALSO DISCUSS HOW THIS PROGRAM CAN ALSO BE IMPLEMENTED IN SHORTER FORMATS TO AUGMENT EXISTING PROFESSIONAL MASTER'S PROGRAMS IN DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES. THIS APPROACH TO LEARNING BY DOING IS DESIGNED TO FILL GAPS IN OUR CURRENT APPROACH TO DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND ENSURE THAT STUDENTS DEVELOP THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO PRACTICE DATA SCIENCE IN A PROFESSIONAL CONTEXT AND UNDER THE MANY CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY THAT CONTEXT.","DATA SCIENCE; EDUCATION; TRAINING; CURRICULUM; DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES","SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ANONYMOUS, 2019, HITCHHIKERS GUIDE DA;ANONYMOUS, 2014, AR TEACH RES MOD GET;ANONYMOUS, 2019, MAST SCI AN;ANONYMOUS, ARXIV160304912;ANONYMOUS, 2017, M 4 ALT I ED MECH;ANONYMOUS, 2019, JOINT PHD PROGR MACH;ANONYMOUS, 2018, DAT SCI PROJ SCOP GU;ANONYMOUS, 2018, M 5 INT ETH PRIV DAT;ANONYMOUS, 2019, MAST SCI COMP AN PUB;BAILER JOHN, 2012, REPORT ASA WORKGROUP;BAUMER B, 2015, AM STAT, V69, P334, DOI 10.1080/00031305.2015.1081105;BROWN EN, 2009, AM STAT, V63, P105, DOI 10.1198/TAST.2009.0019;CAO L., 2018, DATA SCIENCE THINKING: THE NEXT SCIENTIFIC, TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, P329;COBB G, 2015, AM STAT, V69, P266, DOI 10.1080/00031305.2015.1093029;DICHEV C, 2016, PREPARING ALL STUDEN;GRIMSHAW SD, 2015, AM STAT, V69, P307, DOI 10.1080/00031305.2015.1081106;GRISHAM P.

THIS EMERGENCE ALSO EXTENDS TO UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION, WHEREBY A GROWING NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS NOW OFFER DEGREE PROGRAMS IN DATA SCIENCE. HOWEVER, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE VARIATION IN WHAT THE FIELD ACTUALLY ENTAILS AND, BY EXTENSION, DIFFERENCES IN HOW UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS PREPARE STUDENTS FOR DATA-INTENSIVE CAREERS. WE USED TWO SEMINAL FRAMEWORKS FOR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION TO EVALUATE UNDERGRADUATE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS AT A SUBSET OF 4-YEAR INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES; DEVELOPING AND APPLYING A RUBRIC, WE ASSESSED HOW WELL EACH PROGRAM MET THE GUIDELINES OF EACH OF THE FRAMEWORKS. MOST PROGRAMS SCORED HIGH IN STATISTICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE AND LOW IN DOMAIN-SPECIFIC EDUCATION, ETHICS, AND AREAS OF COMMUNICATION. MOREOVER, THE ACADEMIC UNIT ADMINISTERING THE DEGREE PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED THE COURSE-LOAD DISTRIBUTION OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND STATISTICS/MATHEMATICS COURSES. WE CONCLUDE THAT CURRENT DATA SCIENCE UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS PROVIDE SOLID GROUNDING IN COMPUTATIONAL AND STATISTICAL APPROACHES, YET MAY NOT DELIVER SUFFICIENT CONTEXT IN TERMS OF DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS NECESSARY FOR APPROPRIATE DATA SCIENCE APPLICATIONS.

HOWEVER, THERE ARE TWO ISSUES WITH THIS APPROACH: (1) IT IS VERY COSTLY TO PREPARE MULTIPLE REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS (USING REAL DATA) ACCORDING TO THE LEARNING OBJECTIVES, AND (2) THE LEARNER MUST SUDDENLY TACKLE COMPLEX REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEARNING FROM A TEXTBOOK USING IDEAL DATA. TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES, THIS PAPER PROPOSES DATA SCIENCE TEACHING MATERIAL THAT USES AGENT-BASED SIMULATION (ABS). THE PROPOSED TEACHING MATERIAL CONSISTS OF AN ABS MODEL AND AN ABS STORY. TO SOLVE ISSUE 1, THE SCENARIO OF THE PROBLEM CAN BE CHANGED ACCORDING TO THE LEARNING OBJECTIVES BY SETTING THE APPROPRIATE PARAMETERS OF THE ABS MODEL. TO SOLVE ISSUE 2, THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL OF THE TASKS CAN BE ADJUSTED BY CHANGING THE DESCRIPTION IN THE ABS STORY. WE SHOW THAT, BY USING THIS TEACHING MATERIAL, THE LEARNER CAN SIMULATE THE TYPICAL TASKS PERFORMED BY A DATA SCIENTIST IN A STEP- BY-STEP MANNER (CAUSAL INFERENCE, DATA UNDERSTANDING, HYPOTHESIS BUILDING, DATA COLLECTION, DATA WRANGLING, DATA ANALYSIS, AND HYPOTHESIS TESTING). THE TEACHING MATERIAL DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON CAUSAL INFERENCE AS THE LEARNING OBJECTIVES AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES AS THE MODEL THEME FOR ABS, BUT ABS IS USED AS A MODEL TO REPRODUCE MANY TYPES OF SOCIAL PHENOMENA, AND ITS RANGE OF EXPRESSION IS EXTREMELY WIDE.

WE, THEREFORE, INVESTIGATE HOW DATA SCIENCE STUDENTS START REFLECTING AND WHAT CONSTITUTES REFLECTION-TRIGGERING CONTEXTS IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. FOR THIS, WE INTRODUCE A REFLECTIVE ESSAY ASSIGNMENT AND PROPOSE A REFLECTION-SENSITIVE INDUCTIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS TO ANALYZE IT. OUR FINDINGS BASED ON SEVEN STUDENT REFLECTIVE ESSAYS SUGGEST THAT IMPORTANT REFLECTION TRIGGER CHARACTERISTICS IN DATA SCIENCE ETHICS EDUCATION INCLUDE STUDENTS' EXPECTATIONS, A NEW INSIGHT, MOTIVATORS FOR REFLECTION RELATED TO EXPECTATIONS, TEACHING FORMATS, AND EMOTIONS. OUR REFLECTION-SENSITIVE ANALYSIS IS SUITABLE FOR EXPLORATIVE ANALYSIS AND CREATES TRANSPARENCY ABOUT EXISTING SENSITIZING CONCEPTS.","REFLECTIVE DATA SCIENCE PRACTICE; DATA SCIENCE ETHICS; ETHICS IN EDUCATION; CONTENT ANALYSIS; SENSITIZING CONCEPTS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"GERMAN FEDERAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND RESEARCH [16DHBKI025]","THIS WORK IS SUPPORTED BY THE GERMAN FEDERAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, GRANT 16DHBKI025 (""ENKIS -ESTABLISHMENT OF SUSTAINABLE STUDY PROGRAMS FOR RESPONSIBLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AT THE FREIE UNIVERSITAT BERLIN"").","ARAGON C., 2022, HUMAN-CENTERED DATA SCIENCE: AN INTRODUCTION;ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTING MACHINERY (ACM), 2020, ACM C P MASTER TEMPL;ATKINS S, 1993, J ADV NURS, V18, P1188, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2648.1993.18081188.X;BAUMER EPS, 2015, CHI 2015: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 33RD ANNUAL CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS, P585, DOI 10.1145/2702123.2702234;BENTVELZEN M, 2022, PROC ACM INTERACT MO, V6, DOI 10.1145/3517233;BEZUIDENHOUT L, 2021, AI SOC, V36, P939, DOI 10.1007/S00146-020-01112-W;BORENSTEIN JASON, 2021, AI ETHICS, V1, P61, DOI 10.1007/S43681-020-00002-7;BOWEN GA., 2006, INT J QUAL METHODS, V5, P12, DOI DOI 10.1177/160940690600500304, 10.1177/160940690600500304;BUCINCA ZANA, 2021, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION, V5, DOI 10.1145/3449287;DEWEY J., 1933, HOW WE THINK: A RESTATEMENT OF THE RELATION OF REFLECTIVE THINKING TO THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS;EUROPEAN COMMISSION.

TO UNDERSTAND HOW STUDENTS ESTABLISHED CONNECTIONS BETWEEN DATA AND ART, WE EMPLOYED EPISTEMIC NETWORK ANALYSIS (ENA) AT TWO LEVELS TO EXPLORE HOW THEY COMBINE THEIR DATA PRACTICES AND ART PROCESSES. OUR STUDY HAD THREE PRIMARY FINDINGS: (1) STUDENTS HAVE A PERSONALIZED WAY OF COMBINING DATA AND ART; (2) DATA COLLECTION APPEARS TO BE A KEY PRACTICE IN OUR DATA-ART INQUIRY PROGRAM; (3) ART PRODUCTION EMPOWERS STUDENTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND COMMUNICATE THEIR DATA. IN THE FUTURE DESIGN OF A DATA-ART INQUIRY PROGRAM, WE SUGGEST PROGRAMMING MIGHT (1) ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO EXPLORE PERSONALIZED ART FORMATS TO PRESENT THEIR DATA, (2) EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF DATA COLLECTION, AND (3) PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SPACE AND TIME FOR ART PROCESSES TO ENSURE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN DATA AND ARTWORK.","DATA-ART INQUIRY; ENA; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; ARTS EDUCATION","CONTEXT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION; BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY","WE EXTEND OUR HEARTFELT GRATITUDE TO THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP IN MAKING THIS PROJECT A SUCCESS.

THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES THE PERSPECTIVE LENS OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THE MONTGOMERY COLLEGE DATA SCIENCE CERTIFICATE PROGRAM. WE FOUND THAT, CONTRARY TO MANY OTHER EDUCATIONAL FIELDS AT THE COLLEGE, DATA SCIENCE STUDENTS TEND TO COME FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS AND CAREER PATHS. A COMMON THEME EMERGED THAT ALL STUDENTS LEARNED VALUABLE SKILLS AND APPLICATIONS SUCH AS CODING IN VARIOUS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND APPROACHES TO MACHINE LEARNING. OTHER MEANINGFUL THEMES INCLUDED AN APPRECIATION OF COURSE ACCESSIBILITY, ESPECIALLY CATERED TOWARD BUSY PROFESSIONALS WHO MIGHT ONLY BE ABLE TO TAKE EVENING COURSES. STUDENTS APPRECIATED LEARNING THAT DATA SCIENCE AND ETHICS ARE INTERTWINED. FINALLY, IT WAS EVIDENT THAT GOING THROUGH THE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAM POSITIVELY IMPACTED THE LIVES AND CAREERS OF THESE STUDENTS. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE THEMES OF THESE STUDENT EXPERIENCES ARE DISCUSSED AS THEY RELATE TO DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION.

OUR WORK PRESENTS A FIRST STEP IN THIS DIRECTION, BY LEVERAGING THE CODING METRICS FROM TRADITIONAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (HALSTEAD VOLUME AND CYCLOMATIC COMPLEXITY) IN COMBINATION WITH THOSE THAT REFLECT A DATA SCIENCE PROJECT'S LEARNING OBJECTIVES (NUMBER OF LIBRARY CALLS AND NUMBER OF COMMON LIBRARY CALLS WITH THE SOLUTION CODE). THROUGH THESE METRICS, WE EXAMINED THE CODE SUBMISSIONS OF 97 STUDENTS ACROSS TWO SEMESTERS OF AN INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE COURSE. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE METRICS CAN IDENTIFY CASES WHERE STUDENTS HAD OVERLY COMPLICATED CODES AND WOULD BENEFIT FROM SCAFFOLDING FEEDBACK. THE NUMBER OF LIBRARY CALLS, IN PARTICULAR, WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF CHANGES IN SUBMISSION SCORE AND SUBMISSION RUNTIME, WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE DISTINCTIVE NATURE OF DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMING. WE CONCLUDE WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR EXTENDING OUR ANALYSES TOWARDS MORE ACTIONABLE INTERVENTION STRATEGIES, FOR EXAMPLE BY TRACKING THE FINE-GRAINED SUBMISSION GRADING OUTPUTS THROUGHOUT A STUDENT'S SUBMISSION HISTORY, TO BETTER MODEL AND SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR DATA SCIENCE LEARNING PROCESS.","CODING METRICS; LINEAR MIXED MODEL; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; PROGRAMMING ANALYSIS","PROGRAMS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ANONYMOUS, RADON;ANSLOW C., 2016, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 47TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTING SCIENCE EDUCATION, P615, DOI DOI 10.1145/2839509, 10.1145/2839509.2844568, DOI 10.1145/2839509.2844568;BARRIOCANAL E.

ONE PROMISING PHENOMENON INVESTIGATED IN RELATED WORK IS PERSPECTIVE-TAKING. A FIRST-PERSON ""ACTOR"" PERSPECTIVE CAN HELP FACILITATE GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL SENSEMAKING BY MEDIATING OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS TAKEN BY LEARNERS. HERE WE INVESTIGATE HOW MUSEUM VISITORS MADE USE OF AN ACTOR PERSPECTIVE WHEN EXPLORING AN OPEN-ENDED, INTERACTIVE DATA MAP MUSEUM EXHIBIT. WE USE A MIX OF QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE EMPIRICAL METHODS TO EXPLORE HOW ACTOR PERSPECTIVE-TAKING (APT) MAY MEDIATE JOINT SENSEMAKING AROUND DATA VISUALIZATIONS. BY APPLYING INTERPRETIVE CODING TO 54 CONVERSATIONS WHEREIN APT NATURALISTICALLY EMERGED, WE IDENTIFY 3 DISTINCT SELF-TO-DATA RELATIONSHIPS CONSTRUCTED VIA APT: ROLE-PLAY, PROJECTION, AND ORIENTATION. A FURTHER ANALYSIS EXPLORES HOW APT WAS EMBEDDED IN JOINT SENSEMAKING OF THE VISUALIZED DATA. TWELVE APT-MEDIATED SENSEMAKING PROCESSES ARE IDENTIFIED; TWO (EXTRAPOLATING AND NOTICING ABSENCE) WERE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MULTIPLE APT SELF-TO-DATA RELATIONSHIPS, WHILE THE REMAINING TEN (E.G., ENACTING, SPATIALLY CHARACTERIZING, GENERALIZING) WERE EXCLUSIVELY USED WITH SPECIFIC SELF-TO-DATA APT RELATIONSHIPS.

DIFFERENT FROM SOME COMMONLY SEEN MODEL FITTING CRITERIA IN STATISTICS, SUCH AS THE ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES CRITERION AND THE MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD METHOD, ITS ALGORITHM DEPENDS ON AN OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM UNDER CONSTRAINTS, WHICH IS UNCONVENTIONAL TO MANY STUDENTS IN A SECOND OR THIRD COURSE IN STATISTICS OR DATA SCIENCE. AS A RESULT, THIS TOPIC IS OFTEN NOT AS INTUITIVE TO STUDENTS AS SOME OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL STATISTICAL MODELING TOOLS. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE STUDENTS' MASTERY OF THE TOPIC AND PROMOTE ACTIVE LEARNING, WE DEVELOPED SOME IN-CLASS ACTIVITIES AND THEIR ACCOMPANYING SHINY APPLICATIONS FOR TEACHING SUPPORT VECTOR CLASSIFIERS. THE DESIGNED COURSE MATERIALS AIM AT ENGAGING STUDENTS THROUGH GROUP WORK AND SOLIDIFYING STUDENTS' UNDERSTANDING OF THE ALGORITHM VIA HANDS-ON EXPLORATIONS. THE SHINY APPLICATIONS OFFER INTERACTIVE DEMONSTRATION OF THE CHANGES OF THE COMPONENTS OF A SUPPORT VECTOR CLASSIFIER WHEN ALTERING ITS DETERMINING PARAMETERS. WITH THE GOAL OF BENEFITING THE BROADER STATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION COMMUNITY, WE HAVE MADE THE DEVELOPED SHINY APPLICATIONS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.

HERE, WE PRESENT OUR GOALS FOR TEACHING THIS COURSE, INCLUDING: (1) CONCEPTUALIZING DATA SCIENCE AS CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING, WITH A FOCUS ON PROJECT-BASED LEARNING, (2) PRIORITIZING PRACTICAL APPLICATION, TEACHING AND USING STANDARDIZED TOOLS AND BEST PRACTICES, AND (3) SCALING EDUCATION THROUGH COURSEWORK THAT ENABLES HANDS-ON AND CLASSROOM LEARNING IN A LARGE-ENROLLMENT COURSE. THROUGHOUT THIS COURSE WE ALSO EMPHASIZE SOCIAL CONTEXT AND DATA ETHICS TO BEST PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE INTERDISCIPLINARY AND IMPACTFUL NATURE OF THEIR WORK. WE HIGHLIGHT CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING AND STRATEGIES FOR TEACHING AUTOMATION-RESILIENT SKILLS, WHILE PROVIDING STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A UNIQUE DATA SCIENCE PROJECT THAT DEMONSTRATES THEIR TECHNICAL AND CREATIVE CAPACITIES.","COMPUTING; COURSE DESIGN; DATA SCIENCE; PROGRAMMING; PROJECT-BASED LEARNING; PYTHON",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ANACONDA, 2016, AN SOFTW DISTR;ANGWIN J., 2016,

WE SHARE BEST PRACTICES FOR WORKING ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS TO COLLECT DATA NOT ONLY ON INDIVIDUAL COURSES, BUT ALSO ON THE PROGRAM AS A WHOLE. WHILE THE FRAMEWORK PRESENTED WAS INITIALLY ESTABLISHED TO SUPPORT ABET ACCREDITATION, WE ARGUE THAT A PROPERLY EXECUTED PROGRAM ASSESSMENT SHOULD OCCUR REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT AN INSTITUTION IS SEEKING ABET ACCREDITATION FOR THEIR DATA SCIENCE PROGRAM.

IN THIS PAPER, WE USE A BROAD DEFINITION OF DATA SCIENCE TO OUTLINE THREE FOUNDATIONAL ASPECTS THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED DURING THE SCHOOLING YEARS: (1) REASONING WITH DATA; (2) COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; AND (3) INQUIRY-BASED LEARNING. DRAWING ON VIDEO DATA AND ARTEFACTS FROM A PRIMARY CLASSROOM IN AUSTRALIA (CHILDREN AGED 9-10 YEARS OLD), WE EXAMINED HOW A CLASS GENERATED AND GRAPPLED WITH A COMPLEX, AMBIGUOUS PROBLEM ABOUT THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF THEIR ACTIVITIES IN CYBERSPACE. THE INTERDISCIPLINARY LESSON SEQUENCE ENGAGED THE CHILDREN WITH NON-STANDARD DATA, DATA PRIVACY, AND ETHICAL ISSUES IN AGE-APPROPRIATE WAYS. THE ANALYSIS USED AN ITERATIVE PROCESS THAT ANNOTATED VIDEO LOGS, IDENTIFIED AND TRANSCRIBED CRITICAL EVENTS LINKED TO THESE THREE FOUNDATIONAL ASPECTS, AND CODED THESE DATA TO MAKE CONNECTIONS WITHIN AND ACROSS THE DATA. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST A PROCESS FOR INTRODUCING CHILDREN TO AGE-APPROPRIATE PROBLEMS THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED BY DATA SCIENCE THAT REFLECT CONTEXTS IN THEIR WORLD. IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY PROVIDE TEACHERS, RESEARCHERS, AND CURRICULUM DEVELOPERS SUGGESTIONS FOR EMBEDDING DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION INTO PRIMARY SCHOOL.","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION FRAMEWORK; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; INQUIRY-BASED LEARNING; STATISTICS EDUCATION; CYBERSPACE","COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; INQUIRY; CONTEXT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL [DP170101984]; AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL; QUEENSLAND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION; QUT","THIS STUDY WAS FUNDED BY THE AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL (DP170101984) AND IN COLLABORATION FROM THE QUEENSLAND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

THE ADOPTION OF DL IN HYDROLOGY HAS SO FAR BEEN GRADUAL, BUT THE FIELD IS NOW RIPE FOR BREAKTHROUGHS. THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT DLBASED METHODS CAN OPEN UP A COMPLEMENTARY AVENUE TOWARD KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES. IN THE NEW AVENUE, MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHMS PRESENT COMPETING HYPOTHESES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH DATA. INTERROGATIVE METHODS ARE THEN INVOKED TO INTERPRET DL MODELS FOR SCIENTISTS TO FURTHER EVALUATE. HOWEVER, HYDROLOGY PRESENTS MANY CHALLENGES FOR DL METHODS, SUCH AS DATA LIMITATIONS, HETEROGENEITY AND CO-EVOLUTION, AND THE GENERAL INEXPERIENCE OF THE HYDROLOGIC FIELD WITH DL. THE ROADMAP TOWARD DL-POWERED SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES WILL REQUIRE THE COORDINATED EFFORT FROM A LARGE COMMUNITY INVOLVING SCIENTISTS AND CITIZENS. INTEGRATING PROCESS-BASED MODELS WITH DL MODELS WILL HELP ALLEVIATE DATA LIMITATIONS. THE SHARING OF DATA AND BASELINE MODELS WILL IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. OPEN COMPETITIONS COULD SERVE AS THE ORGANIZING EVENTS TO GREATLY PROPEL GROWTH AND NURTURE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IN HYDROLOGY, WHICH DEMANDS A GRASSROOTS COLLABORATION. THE AREA OF HYDROLOGIC DL PRESENTS NUMEROUS RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES THAT COULD, IN TURN, STIMULATE ADVANCES IN MACHINE LEARNING AS WELL.",NA,"THEORY-GUIDED-DATA; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; NEURAL-NETWORK; PRECIPITATION ESTIMATION; SOIL-MOISTURE; WATER; REGRESSION; PATTERNS; FLOW; BIAS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY [DE-SC0016605]; U.S. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [EAR-1832294]; CANADIAN NSERC-DG [403047]; KEY RAMP;D PROJECTS OF THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT IN SICHUAN PROVINCE [2018SZ0343]; STATE KEY LABORATORY OF HYDRAULICS AND MOUNTAIN RIVER ENGINEERING, SICHUAN UNIVERSITY; NSF [CCF-1317560, EAR-1338606]; BELGIAN NUCLEAR RESEARCH CENTRE","WE THANK MATTHEW MCCABE, KEITH SAWICZ, AND AN ANONYMOUS REVIEWER FOR THEIR VALUABLE COMMENTS, WHICH HELPED TO IMPROVE THE PAPER.

YET IT CAN BE A CHALLENGE TO FIT THE TEACHING OF SUCH SKILLS INTO THE DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM. TEAM-BASED LEARNING (TBL) IS A PEDAGOGICAL STRATEGY THAT CAN HELP EDUCATORS TEACH DATA SCIENCE BETTER BY FLIPPING THE CLASSROOM TO EMPLOY SMALL-GROUP COLLABORATIVE LEARNING TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE STUDENTS IN DOING DATA SCIENCE. A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS TEACHING METHOD IS HELPING STUDENTS ACHIEVE THE WORKFORCE-RELEVANT DATA SCIENCE LEARNING GOALS OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, TEAMWORK, AND COLLABORATION. WE DESCRIBE THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF TBL: ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURES AND FEEDBACK MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT STUDENTS COLLABORATING WITHIN PERMANENT TEAMS ON WELL-DESIGNED APPLICATION EXERCISES TO DO DATA SCIENCE. THE RESULTS OF OUR CASE STUDY OF USING TBL TO TEACH A MODERN, INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE COURSE INDICATE THAT THE COURSE EFFECTIVELY TAUGHT REPRODUCIBLE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOWS, BEGINNING R PROGRAMMING, AND COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION. STUDENTS ALSO REPORTED MUCH ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR LEARNING OF STATISTICAL THINKING AND ADVANCED R CONCEPTS. TO HELP THE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION COMMUNITY ADOPT THIS APPEALING PEDAGOGICAL STRATEGY, WE OUTLINE STEPS FOR DECIDING ON USING TBL, PREPARING AND PLANNING FOR IT, AND OVERCOMING POTENTIAL PITFALLS WHEN USING TBL TO TEACH DATA SCIENCE.","COLLABORATION; COOPERATIVE LEARNING; R PROGRAMMING; SMALL-GROUP LEARNING; STATISTICAL THINKING; TIDYVERSE","GUIDELINES; STUDENTS; STATISTICS; EDUCATION; PROGRAMS; IMPACT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NSF DIVISION OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION [2044384]; DIRECTORATE FOR STEM EDUCATION; DIVISION OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION [2044384] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION","THIS WORK WAS PARTIALLY FUNDED BY NSF DIVISION OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION GRANT #2044384 FOR IUSE: COLLABORATIVE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION: STATISTICSWITH INTEGRATION OF TECHNOLOGY, COMPUTING, AND THE HUMANITIES (CODE:SWITCH).","ALLAIRE J.J., 2021, RMARKDOWN DYNAMIC DO;ANONYMOUS, 2020, TIDYVERSE;ANONYMOUS, 2011, P 16 ANN JOINT C INN, DOI DOI 10.1145/1999747.1999787;BURGESS AW, 2014, ACAD MED, V89, P678, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0000000000000162;CARVER R., 2016, GUIDELINES ASSESSMEN;CETINKAYA-RUNDEL M., 2021, DATA SCI BOX DATA SC;CETINKAYARUNDEL M., 2021, J STAT EDUC, V29, PS16, DOI 10.1080/10691898.2020.1804497, DOI 10.1080/10691898.2020.1804497;COBB G.W., 1992, HEEDING THE CALL FOR CHANGE: SUGGESTIONS FOR CURRICULAR ACTION, P3;COLLINS CM, 2019, MED SCI EDUC, V29, P1175, DOI 10.1007/S40670-019-00794-2;COOPERSTEIN S.

WE STRONGLY AGREE WITH THIS RECOMMENDATION, BUT ADVOCATE THE MAIN PRIORITY IS TO BRING APPLICATIONS TO THE FOREFRONT AS PROPOSED BY NOLAN AND SPEED IN 1999. WE ALSO ARGUE THAT THE INDIVIDUALS TASKED WITH DEVELOPING DATA SCIENCE COURSES SHOULD NOT ONLY HAVE STATISTICAL TRAINING, BUT ALSO HAVE EXPERIENCE ANALYZING DATA WITH THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF SOLVING REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS. HERE, WE SHARE A SET OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND OFFER A DETAILED GUIDE DERIVED FROM OUR SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE DEVELOPING AND TEACHING A GRADUATE-LEVEL, INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE COURSE CENTERED ENTIRELY ON CASE STUDIES. WE ARGUE FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF STATISTICAL THINKING, AS DEFINED BY WILD AND PFANNKUCH IN 1999 AND DESCRIBE HOW OUR APPROACH TEACHES STUDENTS THREE KEY SKILLS NEEDED TO SUCCEED IN DATA SCIENCE, WHICH WE REFER TO AS CREATING, CONNECTING, AND COMPUTING.

THIS GROWTH HAS RESULTED IN STRAINING PROGRAM RESOURCES AT MANY INSTITUTIONS AND CAUSING CONCERN ABOUT HOW TO MOST EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO THE RAPIDLY GROWING DEMAND AND PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL STUDENTS TO PURSUE THEIR DEGREE. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO PROVIDE AN INTELLIGENT SOLUTION TO AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY BIASES RELATED TO RACE AND GENDER IN THE CONTENT OF DATA SCIENCE RELATED COURSES SUCH AS MACHINE LEARNING (ML), NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP), DATA MINING, DATA ANALYTICS, AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY JUST TO NAME A FEW. WHILE MACHINE LEARNING ALLOWS TO BUILD POWERFUL PREDICTING TOOLS, IT HASN'T BEEN USED SUFFICIENTLY TO DETECT BIASES ROOTED IN GENDER AND RACE IN EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL. HENCE, USING EFFECTIVE MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES WE AIM TO ENHANCE THE SUCCESS RATE OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND PROGRAMS WHILE PROMOTING ENGAGEMENT THROUGH IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING POTENTIAL GENDER AND RACIAL BIASES. TO THIS END, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL BIAS DETECTION APPROACH WHICH USES A COMBINATION OF GENDER IDENTIFICATION AND SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION FOR CHARACTERIZATION OF GENDER AND RACE IN EDUCATIONAL CONTENTS. OUR PROPOSED FRAMEWORK CAN HELP EDUCATORS AND COURSE DEVELOPERS TO MITIGATE RACE AND GENDER BIASES IN THEIR COURSE MATERIALS AND CREATE AN EQUITABLE LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS OF MINORITY AND UNDER-REPRESENTED GROUPS.","GENDER AND RACIAL EQUITY; MACHINE LEARNING; DATA SCIENCE; EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ANONYMOUS, GENDERED WORDS DATAS;CHERYAN S, 2009, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V97, P1045, DOI 10.1037/A0016239;DAS K, 2017, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE RESEARCH IN COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING, V5, P1301, DOI DOI 10.15680/IJIRCCE.2017.0502001, 10.15680/IJIRCCE.2017.0502001;DAVIDSON T, 2019, THIRD WORKSHOP ON ABUSIVE LANGUAGE ONLINE, P25;DIEDERIK K., ARXIV;ETHAYARAJH K, 2019, 57TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS (ACL 2019), P1696;FAN A., 2020, P 2020 C EMPIRICAL M;FRY R., 2021, PEW RESEARCH CENTER REPORT;LANG M.

THE IPSJ DS CURRICULUM STANDARD IS DEVELOPED BY INTEGRATING VARIOUS RELATED INITIATIVES AND HAS THE FOLLOWING UNIQUE FEATURES. (1) THE DS CURRICULUM STANDARD COVERS A WIDE RANGE OF RELATED FIELDS TO ENSURE INTERNATIONAL COMPATIBILITY THROUGH MAPPING TO THE ACM DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM AND THE EUROPEAN EDISON DATA SCIENCE FRAMEWORK. (2) IT COLLABORATES WITH THE IPSJ DATA SCIENTIST CERTIFICATION (UNDER DEVELOPMENT) BY REFERRING TO THE DATA SCIENTIST SKILL CHECKLIST (ASSISTANT LEVEL) DEVELOPED BY THE DATA SCIENTIST SOCIETY OF JAPAN. (3) IT CLARIFIES THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS REQUIRED OF STUDENTS MAJORING IN DATA SCIENCE. (4) IT ASSIGNS A TIME TO EACH EDUCATIONAL CONTENT SO THAT THE CURRICULUM SIZE BECOMES APPROXIMATELY 675 CLASS HOURS (60 CREDITS IN THE JAPANESE CREDIT SYSTEM).

DATA SCIENCE IS A NEW AND INTERDISCIPLINARY STEM-ORIENTED DOMAIN, INTEGRATING KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS FROM COMPUTER SCIENCE, MATHEMATICS, AND STATISTICS WITH AN APPLICATION DOMAIN, FROM WHICH THE DATA DRAW THEIR CONTEXT AND MEANING. DATA SCIENCE APPLICATIONS ARE RELEVANT FOR VARIOUS DOMAINS, AND THEREFORE, A VARIETY OF POPULATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY ATTRACTED TO LEARNING IT. ADDRESSING THE THEME OF THE CONFERENCE, I.E., ""WOMEN IN ENGINEERING"", IN THIS PAPER WE DESCRIBE A DATA SCIENCE WORKSHOP FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES AND DIGITAL HUMANITIES RESEARCHERS. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY (83%) OF THE PARTICIPANTS OF THIS WORKSHOP SELF-IDENTIFIED AS WOMEN. THIS GENDER PROPORTION, THE OPPOSITE OF THAT PREVAILING IN STEM STUDIES, LED US TO EXAMINE THE WORKSHOP FROM A GENDER PERSPECTIVE. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN THE DATA SCIENCE WORKSHOP PERCEIVED IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE RESEARCH TOOLS RATHER THAN PROGRAMMING TOOLS. WE SUGGEST THAT FRAMING THE WORKSHOP AS A RESEARCH TOOL WORKSHOP AND NOT AS A PROGRAMMING WORKSHOP REDUCED PREVALENT GENDER BARRIERS IN STEM, ENCOURAGING A MAJORITY OF WOMEN RESEARCHERS TO PARTICIPATE. IN THIS PAPER, WE ELABORATE ON THE PARTICIPANTS' PERCEPTIONS ABOUT DATA SCIENCE AND PROGRAMMING AND ANALYZE THEM BASED ON THREE THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES: EXPECTANCY VALUE THEORY, THE INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE, AND THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE.

THE MODEL OF THE QUANTIFIED SELF-IN WHICH DATA ABOUT ONE'S OWN ACTIVITIES ARE COLLECTED AND MADE INTO OBJECTS OF STUDY-PROVIDES INSPIRATION FOR ONE SUCH APPROACH. BY DRAWING ON WHAT ONE ALREADY KNOWS ABOUT THEIR SELF AND THEIR PRIOR EXPERIENCES, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO BOOTSTRAP STUDENTS' ABILITIES TO INTERPRET AND MAKE SENSE OF DATA. TAKING THAT POSSIBILITY SERIOUSLY, THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES SOME OF THE GAINS OBSERVED IN STUDENTS' STATISTICAL REASONING FOLLOWING A QUANTIFIED SELF, WEARABLES-BASED ELEMENTARY STATISTICS UNIT AND PROVIDES A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK DRAWING FROM COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY, EMBODIMENT, AND SITUATIVE PERSPECTIVES TO CHARACTERIZE HOW PRIOR EXPERIENCE IS USED AS A RESOURCE IN DATA SENSE-MAKING WHEN THE DATA ARE ABOUT STUDENTS' OWN PHYSICAL EXPERIENCES. THIS FRAMEWORK CENTRALIZES AND INTERROGATES THE WORK OF ""REMEMBERING"" PRIOR EXPERIENCES AND ARTICULATES HOW REMEMBERING IS INVOLVED IN INTERPRETING QUANTIFIED SELF DATA. SPECIFICALLY, THE FRAMEWORK EMPHASIZES THAT REMEMBERING IN SERVICE OF DATA INTERPRETATION IS A RECONSTRUCTIVE ACT THAT DRAWS FROM BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIFIC EMBODIED RESOURCES AND THAT THE WORK OF RECONSTRUCTIVE REMEMBERING IN THE CLASSROOM IS BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND MULTI-PARTICIPANT WORK. TO DEMONSTRATE MEASURED LEARNING GAINS AND ILLUSTRATE THE FRAMEWORK, WRITTEN ASSESSMENT RESULTS AND DESCRIPTIVE CASES OF STUDENT AND TEACHER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT QUANTIFIED SELF DATA FROM TWO SIXTH-GRADE CLASSES PARTICIPATING IN A CLASSROOM DESIGN EXPERIMENT ARE PROVIDED.

MUCH OF THE ATTENTION HAS BEEN ON THE APPLICATION OF AI PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES, ESPECIALLY MACHINE LEARNING, NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS. WHILE AI IS ONLY ONE PHASE IN THE DATA SCIENCE ECOSYSTEM, WE MUST EMBRACE A FULLER RANGE OF JOB ROLES THAT HELP MANAGE AI ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS - FROM THE AI INNOVATORS AND ARCHITECTS (IN CS, MATH AND STATISTICS) TO THE AI TECHNICIANS AND SPECIALISTS (IN CS, IT AND IS). ALSO, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LOW PARTICIPATION AND REPRESENTATION OF MINORITIZED GROUPS THAT FURTHER STIFLES THE ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION EFFORTS. HOWEVER, HOW WE LEARN AND WHAT WE LEARN IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON WHO WE ARE AS LEARNERS. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXAMINE DEMOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES BY RACE/ETHNICITY AND GENDER WITHIN THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS EDUCATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FROM AN EVALUATIVE PERSPECTIVE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE ADOPT INTERSECTIONAL METHODS AND APPLY THE THEORY OF PUBLIC VALUE FAILURE TO IDENTIFY LEARNING GAPS IN THE FAST-GROWING FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE. NATIONAL DATASETS OF MASTER'S AND DOCTORAL GRADUATE STUDENTS IN IS, CS, MATH AND STATISTICS ARE USED TO CREATE AN ""INSTITUTIONAL PARITY SCORE"" WHICH CALCULATES FIELD-SPECIFIC REPRESENTATION BY RACE/ETHNICITY AND GENDER IN DATA SCIENCE RELATED FIELDS. WE CONCLUDE BY SHOWCASING BIAS CREEP INCLUDING THE SITUATIONAL EXCLUSION OF INDIVIDUALS FROM ACCESS TO THE BROADER INFORMATION ECONOMY, BE IT ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGIES AND DATA OR ACCESS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DATA WORKFORCE OR DATA ENABLED-ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE SUGGESTED TO CURB AND REDUCE THIS MARGINALIZATION WITHIN IN-FORMATION SYSTEMS AND RELATED DISCIPLINES.","DATA SCIENCE; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; INSTITUTIONAL PARITY SCORE; INTERSECTIONAL; DIVERSITY; GRADUATE EDUCATION; HBCU",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ABBASI A, 2016, J ASSOC INF SYST, V17, PI;ANONYMOUS, 2017, WOMEN, MINORITIES, AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING;ANONYMOUS, 2019, HARNHAM REPORT;BOZEMAN B, 2002, PUBLIC ADMIN REV, V62, P145, DOI 10.1111/0033-3352.00165;BOZEMAN BARRY., 2007, PUBLIC VALUES PUBLIC;BUOLAMWINI J., 2018, P 1 C FAIRNESS ACCOU, V81, P77, DOI DOI 10.2147/OTT.S126905;BURTCH LINDA, 2019, THE BURTCH WORKS STUDY: SALARIES OF DATA SCIENTISTS & PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS PROFESSIONALS;COLLINS P.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS A HIGHLY INNOVATIVE COURSE IN A UK UNIVERSITY THAT INTRODUCES UNDERGRADUATE MEDICAL STUDENTS TO DATA SCIENCE. IT ALSO DISCUSSES A STUDY ON STUDENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE LEARNING AND TEACHING OF HEALTH DATA SCIENCE.METHODS: THE PEDAGOGICAL DESIGN ELEMENTS OF THE DATA SCIENCE IN MEDICINE COURSE ARE DISCUSSED, ALONG WITH ITS SYLLABUS, ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY AND FLIPPED CLASSROOM DELIVERY. THE COURSE HAS BEEN OFFERED TO APPROXIMATELY 630 STUDENTS OVER THREE YEARS. STUDENT PERSPECTIVES WERE INVESTIGATED THROUGH THREE FOCUS GROUPS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF 19 STUDENTS ACROSS DIFFERENT STUDY YEARS IN MEDICINE. AN EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED REGARDING INSTRUCTOR-LED VS. VIDEO-BASED MODALITIES OF ONLINE PROGRAMMING LABS, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF 8 STUDENTS.RESULTS: THE COURSE HAS LED TO IMPROVED DATA COMPETENCY AMONG MEDICAL STUDENTS AND TO A POSITIVE CHANGE IN THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT DATA SCIENCE. MOTIVATING THE COURSE AND SHOWING RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES. STATISTICS WAS PERCEIVED BY FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS AS AN ESSENTIAL DATA SKILL. INCLUDING DATA SCIENCE IN THE MEDICAL CURRICULUM WAS PERCEIVED AS IMPORTANT BY YEAR 1 STUDENTS, WHILE OPINIONS VARIED BETWEEN YEAR 4/5 PARTICIPANTS. VIDEO-BASED ONLINE LABS WERE PREFERRED OVER INSTRUCTOR-LED ONLINE LABS, AND THEY WERE FOUND TO BE MORE USEFUL AND ENJOYABLE, WITHOUT LEADING TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. CONCLUSIONS: TEACHING DATA SCIENCE TO UNDERGRADUATE MEDICINE STUDENTS IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE AND FEASIBLE. WE RECOMMEND INCLUDING STATISTICS IN THE CURRICULUM AND PRACTICAL SKILL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH SIMPLE AND CLINICALLYRELEVANT DATA SCIENCE TASKS, SUPPORTED THROUGH VIDEO-BASED ONLINE LABS. FURTHER REPORTING ON SIMILAR COURSES IS NEEDED, AS WELL AS LARGER-SCALE STUDIES ON STUDENT PERSPECTIVES.","DATA SCIENCE; HEALTH; MEDICINE; EDUCATION; TRAINING; HEALTH INFORMATICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"AKÇAYIR G, 2018, COMPUT EDUC, V126, P334, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2018.07.021;ALDRIDGE RW, 2019, LANCET PUBLIC HEALTH, V4, PE373, DOI 10.1016/S2468-2667(19)30112-4;ATTWOOD TK, 2019, BRIEF BIOINFORM, V20, P398, DOI 10.1093/BIB/BBX100;BOWLING A., 2014, RESEARCH METHODS IN HEALTH: INVESTIGATING HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES;ÇETINKAYA-RUNDEL M, 2021, J STAT DATA SCI EDUC, V29, PS16, DOI 10.1080/10691898.2020.1804497;CHEN F, 2017, MED EDUC, V51, P585, DOI 10.1111/MEDU.13272;DAVIES A, 2020, INT J MED INFORM, V141, DOI 10.1016/J.IJMEDINF.2020.104237;DONOGHUE T, 2021, J STAT DATA SCI EDUC, V29, PS27, DOI 10.1080/10691898.2020.1860725;DUNN MC, 2017, PLOS BIOL, V15, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.2003082;GUO P.

YET, LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT THE PEDAGOGICAL PRACTICES AND TOOLS EMPLOYED IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW, WE SUMMARIZE PRIOR PEDAGOGICAL PRACTICES AND TOOLS USED IN DATA SCIENCE INITIATIVES AT THE HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL. FOLLOWING THE TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (TPACK) FRAMEWORK, WE AIM TO CHARACTERIZE THE TECHNOLOGICAL AND PEDAGOGICAL KNOWLEDGE QUALITY OF REVIEWED STUDIES, AS WE FIND THE CONTENT PRESENTED TO BE DIVERSE AND INCOMPARABLE. TPACK IS A UNIVERSALLY ESTABLISHED METHOD FOR TEACHING CONSIDERING INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY. YET IT IS SELDOM USED FOR THE ANALYSIS OF DATA SCIENCE PEDAGOGY. TO MAKE THIS FRAMEWORK MORE STRUCTURED, WE LIST THE TOOLS EMPLOYED IN EACH REVIEWED STUDY TO SUMMARIZE TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE QUALITY. WE FURTHER EXAMINE WHETHER EACH STUDY FOLLOWS THE NEEDS OF THE COGNITIVE APPRENTICESHIP THEORY TO SUMMARIZE THE PEDAGOGICAL KNOWLEDGE QUALITY IN EACH REVIEWED STUDY. OF THE 23 REVIEWED STUDIES, 14 MET THE NEEDS OF COGNITIVE APPRENTICESHIP THEORY AND INCLUDE HANDS-ON EXPERIENCES, PROMOTE STUDENTS' ACTIVE LEARNING, SEEKING GUIDANCE FROM THE INSTRUCTOR AS A COACH, INTRODUCE STUDENTS TO THE REAL-WORLD INDUSTRY DEMANDS OF DATA AND DATA SCIENTISTS, AND PROVIDE MEANINGFUL LEARNING RESOURCES AND FEEDBACK ACROSS VARIOUS STAGES OF THEIR DATA SCIENCE INITIATIVES. WHILE EACH STUDY PRESENTS AT LEAST ONE TOOL TO TEACH DATA SCIENCE, WE FOUND THE ASSESSMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE OF DATA SCIENCE INITIATIVES TO BE DIFFICULT. THIS IS BECAUSE THE STUDIES FALL SHORT OF EXPLAINING HOW STUDENTS COME TO LEARN THE OPERATION OF TOOLS AND BECOME PROFICIENT IN USING THEM THROUGHOUT A COURSE OR PROGRAM.

JUSTICE-CENTERED STEM EDUCATION ENGAGES ALL STUDENTS IN MULTIPLE STEM SUBJECTS, INCLUDING DATA SCIENCE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE, TO EXPLAIN AND DESIGN SOLUTIONS TO SOCIETAL CHALLENGES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING MINORITIZED GROUPS. WE ARTICULATE THE AFFORDANCES OF JUSTICE-CENTERED STEM EDUCATION FOR ONE MINORITIZED STUDENT GROUP THAT HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLY DENIED MEANINGFUL STEM LEARNING: MULTILINGUAL LEARNERS (MLS). JUSTICE-CENTERED STEM EDUCATION WITH MLS LEVERAGES THE ASSETS THEY BRING TO STEM LEARNING, INCLUDING THEIR TRANSNATIONAL EXPERIENCES AND KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS THEIR RICH REPERTOIRE OF MEANING-MAKING RESOURCES. IN THIS POSITION PAPER, WE PROPOSE OUR CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK TO CHART A NEW RESEARCH AGENDA ON JUSTICE-CENTERED STEM EDUCATION TO ADDRESS SOCIETAL CHALLENGES WITH ALL STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY MLS. OUR CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK INCORPORATES FOUR INTERRELATED COMPONENTS BY LEVERAGING THE CONVERGENCE OF MULTIPLE STEM DISCIPLINES TO PROMOTE JUSTICE-CENTERED STEM EDUCATION WITH MLS: (A) SOCIETAL CHALLENGES IN SCIENCE EDUCATION, (B) JUSTICE-CENTERED DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, (C) JUSTICE-CENTERED COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, AND (D) JUSTICE-CENTERED ENGINEERING EDUCATION. THE ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES OUR CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK USING THE CASE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WHICH HAS PRESENTED AN UNPRECEDENTED SOCIETAL CHALLENGE BUT ALSO AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO CULTIVATE MLS' ASSETS TOWARD PROMOTING JUSTICE IN STEM EDUCATION. FINALLY, WE DESCRIBE HOW OUR CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHES THE FOUNDATION FOR A NEW RESEARCH AGENDA THAT ADDRESSES INCREASINGLY COMPLEX, PREVALENT, AND INTRACTABLE SOCIETAL CHALLENGES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING MINORITIZED GROUPS.

THE USE OF COMPUTING SOFTWARE HAS BECOME UBIQUITOUS AND A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF DATA SCIENCE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY ESSENTIAL FOR RESEARCHERS IN ALL DOMAINS. HOWEVER, CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT FOCUSING ON IMPARTING FOUNDATIONAL PROGRAMMING SKILLS AND FUNDAMENTALS OF DATA SCIENCE FOR RESEARCHERS IN DOMAINS OTHER THAN COMPUTING HAS BEEN SCARCE. THUS, THERE IS AN UNMET NEED FOR CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT INVOLVING COMPUTATIONAL THINKING, PROGRAMMING, AND THE FUNDAMENTALS OF DATA SCIENCE FOR THIS AUDIENCE. RECOGNIZING THESE GROWING NEEDS AND DEMANDS OF RESEARCHERS TO LEARN PROGRAMMING AND DATA SCIENCE THAT CAN THEN BE APPLIED TO THEIR AREA OF RESEARCH OR PRACTICE, WE DEVELOPED AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE IN PROGRAMMING AND DATA SCIENCE FOR PDRS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE COURSE WAS TO DEVELOP COMPUTATIONAL THINKING SKILLS IN PDRS WHO HAIL FROM BACKGROUNDS THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY NOT FOCUSED ON INCULCATING COMPUTATIONAL THINKING. THIS COURSE COVERED THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF PROGRAMMING USING EITHER PYTHON OR R - LANGUAGES THAT RESEARCHERS OUTSIDE THE COMPUTING COMMUNITY USE IN NUMEROUS WAYS INCLUDING THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF LARGE DATASETS THAT ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMMON IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. FURTHER, PDRS ENROLLED IN THE COURSE WERE INTRODUCED TO SOME OF THE BROAD CATEGORIES OF PROBLEMS IN DATA SCIENCE - EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS, CLASSIFICATION, REGRESSION, AND CLUSTERING - ALONG WITH RELEVANT ALGORITHMS AND HOW THEY CAN BE APPLIED TO REAL-WORLD DATASETS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE DOMAINS USING PACKAGES OR LIBRARIES IN PYTHON OR R. WE ALSO REPORT THE FEEDBACK FROM THE ENROLLED PDRS, LESSONS LEARNED, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INSTRUCTORS INTERESTED IN DESIGNING SIMILAR CURRICULA. OUR COURSE FOCUSING ON COMPUTING AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION FOR POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLARS FROM A NON-COMPUTING BACKGROUND DEMONSTRATES A PROMISING MODEL FOR INCORPORATING COMPUTING EDUCATION IN OTHER AREAS OF STUDY THAT DO NOT TRADITIONALLY HAVE A FOCUS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION AS WELL AS IN CONTINUING EDUCATION.","COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION; INTERDISCIPLINARY COMPUTING EDUCATION; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; CONTINUING EDUCATION","GEROPSYCHOLOGY; BIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"CELEPKOLU M, 2018, SIGCSE'18: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 49TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, P765, DOI 10.1145/3159450.3159516;COCK PJA, 2009, BIOINFORMATICS, V25, P1422, DOI 10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTP163;COUNCIL N.

INNOVATION, COMPUTATION, AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES HAVE NOW TREMENDOUSLY ACCELERATED THE PACE OF DISCOVERY, PROVIDING DRIVERLESS CARS, ROBOTIC DEVICES, EXPERT HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, PRECISION MEDICINE, AND AUTOMATED DISCOVERY TO MENTION A FEW. EVEN THOUGH THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM DATA SCIENCE CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, THE SWEEPING IMPACT IT HAS ALREADY PRODUCED ON SOCIETY IS UNDENIABLE. WE ARE AT A POINT WHEN NEW DISCOVERIES THROUGH DATA SCIENCE HAVE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL TO ADVANCE PROGRESS BUT ALSO TO BE USED MALICIOUSLY, WITH HARMFUL ETHICAL AND SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES. PERHAPS NOWHERE IS THIS MORE CLEARLY EXEMPLIFIED THAN IN THE BIOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL SCIENCES. THE CONFLUENCE OF (1) MACHINE LEARNING, (2) MATHEMATICAL MODELING, (3) COMPUTATION/SIMULATION, AND (4) BIG DATA HAVE MOVED US FROM THE SEQUENCING OF GENOMES TO GENE EDITING AND INDIVIDUALIZED MEDICINE; YET, UNSETTLED POLICIES REGARDING DATA PRIVACY AND ETHICAL NORMS COULD POTENTIALLY OPEN DOORS FOR SERIOUS NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS. THE DATA SCIENCE REVOLUTION HAS AMPLIFIED THE URGENT NEED FOR A PARADIGM SHIFT IN UNDERGRADUATE BIOLOGY EDUCATION. IT HAS REAFFIRMED THAT DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION INTERACTS AND ENHANCES MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION IN ADVANCING QUANTITATIVE CONCEPTUAL AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT FOR THE NEW GENERATION OF BIOLOGISTS. THESE CONNECTIONS ENCOURAGE US TO STRIVE TO CULTIVATE A BROADLY SKILLED WORKFORCE OF TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY PROBLEM-SOLVERS, SKILLED AT HANDLING THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES PERTAINING TO BIOLOGICAL DATA, AND CAPABLE OF COLLABORATING ACROSS VARIOUS DISCIPLINES IN THE SCIENCES, THE HUMANITIES, AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, WE SUGGEST DEVELOPMENT OF OPEN CURRICULA THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE JOB CERTIFICATION RHETORIC AND COMBINE DATA ACUMEN WITH MODELING, EXPERIMENTAL, AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS THROUGH ENGAGING PROJECTS, WHILE ALSO PROVIDING AWARENESS AND DEEP EXPLORATION OF THEIR SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS. THIS PROCESS WOULD BENEFIT FROM EMBRACING THE PEDAGOGY OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING AND INVOLVE STUDENTS IN OPEN-ENDED EXPLORATIONS DERIVED FROM AUTHENTIC INQUIRIES AND ONGOING RESEARCH.

DATA SCIENCE IS A COMPLEX AND INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELD, ENCOMPASSING MATHEMATICS, STATISTICS, COMPUTER SCIENCE, AND GRAPHIC DESIGN, BESIDES DISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE [10,12,17]. DATA SCIENCE ALSO INVOLVES A WIDE ARRAY OF FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS, INCLUDING DATA GENERATION, STORAGE, TRANSFORMATION, INTERPRETATION, AND VISUALIZATION [30], AS WELL AS CONCEPTS SUCH AS VARIABILITY, AGGREGATION, CONTEXT, AND INFERENCE [26]. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE FIELD, THE DESIGN AND DOCUMENTATION OF EDUCATIONAL APPROACHES THAT ADDRESS SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS INVOLVED IN DATA SCIENCE ARE CENTRAL TO ADVANCING THE WAY CHILDREN MAY LEARN WITH DATA. DATA VISUALIZATION STANDS AS A CORE COMPONENT OF DATA LITERACY. CURRENTLY, EDUCATIONAL TOOLS PREDOMINANTLY RELY ON THE SELECTION OF TEMPLATES FOR CONSTRUCTING VISUALIZATIONS. THIS APPROACH CAN AUTOMATE THE WORK BUT OBSCURES THE FUNDAMENTAL PROCESS OF MAPPING DATA VALUES TO REPRESENTATIONAL FORMS WHILE ALSO RESTRICTING THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPLORING NOVEL TYPES OF VISUAL DISPLAYS [26]. INTENDING TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN DATA VISUALIZATION TASKS IN MORE INVENTIVE AND REFLEXIVE WAYS, OVER THE PAST YEARS WE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING A NEW BLOCK-BASED PROGRAMMING TOOL FOR DATA VISUALIZATION PURPOSES [PLAYDATA; 11]. THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, WE CONDUCTED SEVERAL STUDIES AND WORKSHOPS WITH STUDENTS OF VARYING AGES TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY USED THE TOOL FOR CREATING VISUALIZATIONS AND DERIVED MEANING FROM THEM. THIS PROCESS INVOLVED NOT ONLY REFINING ITERATIVELY THE TOOL BUT ALSO THE ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH IT. DESPITE THE POTENTIAL WE FORESAW FOR THE TOOL, WE OBSERVED SEVERAL CHALLENGES WHEN IMPLEMENTING ACTIVITIES WITH CHILDREN. IN THIS PAPER, WE CRITICALLY ANALYZE HOW STUDENTS ENGAGED IN DATA REPRESENTATION ACTIVITIES USING PLAYDATA, DESCRIBING CHALLENGES THAT AROSE FROM EITHER UNEXPECTED USES OF THE TOOL OR SHORTCOMINGS IN THE DESIGN OF ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO DETAIL HOW WE LEVERAGED THESE CHALLENGES AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENHANCING THE DESIGN OF BOTH THE TOOL AND THE ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES. WE CONCLUDE BY PRESENTING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE DESIGN OF ACTIVITIES WHERE VISUALIZATIONS ARE EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED TO REASONING WITH DATA.","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; DATA VISUALIZATION; BLOCK-BASED PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENTS; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; DESIGN-BASED RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PROJETO CIENCIA NA ESCOLA [441066/2019-4 CNPQ]; PROJETO PROEDUCA (PROCESSO FAPESP) [2022/06977-5]; CAPES INOVAEAD [EI-UAB-20232635986P]","THIS WORK WAS PARTIALLY SUPPORTED BY THE GRANTS PROJETO CIENCIA NA ESCOLA (441066/2019-4 CNPQ), PROJETO PROEDUCA (PROCESSO FAPESP N DEGREES 2022/06977-5) AND CAPES INOVAEAD (EI-UAB-20232635986P).

THIS NEW FIELD REQUIRES A WIDE RANGE OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS FROM DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES INCLUDING MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS, COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PRESENT THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY THAT EXPLORED THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE FROM THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE (LIS) PERSPECTIVE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH ANALYSIS OF RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS ON DATA SCIENCE WAS MADE ON THE BASIS OF PAPERS PUBLISHED IN THE WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE. THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS WERE PROPOSED: WHAT ARE THE MAIN TENDENCIES IN PUBLICATION YEARS, DOCUMENT TYPES, COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN, SOURCE TITLES, AUTHORS OF PUBLICATIONS, AFFILIATIONS OF THE ARTICLE AUTHORS AND THE MOST CITED ARTICLES RELATED TO DATA SCIENCE IN THE FIELD OF LIS? WHAT ARE THE MAIN THEMES DISCUSSED IN THE PUBLICATIONS FROM THE LIS PERSPECTIVE? FINDINGS THE HIGHEST CONTRIBUTION TO DATA SCIENCE COMES FROM THE COMPUTER SCIENCE RESEARCH COMMUNITY. THE CONTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND LIBRARY SCIENCE COMMUNITY IS QUITE SMALL. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN CONTINUOUS INCREASE IN ARTICLES FROM THE YEAR 2015. THE MAIN DOCUMENT TYPES ARE JOURNAL ARTICLES, FOLLOWED BY CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS AND EDITORIAL MATERIAL. THE TOP THREE JOURNALS THAT PUBLISH DATA SCIENCE PAPERS FROM THE LIS PERSPECTIVE ARE THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION, THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND THE JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. THE TOP FIVE COUNTRIES PUBLISHING ARE USA, CHINA, ENGLAND, AUSTRALIA AND INDIA. THE MOST CITED ARTICLE HAS GOT 112 CITATIONS. THE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE DATA SCIENCE FIELD IS QUITE INTERDISCIPLINARY BY NATURE. IN ADDITION TO THE FIELD OF LIS THE PAPERS BELONGED TO SEVERAL OTHER RESEARCH AREAS. THE REVIEWED ARTICLES BELONGED TO THE SIX BROAD CATEGORIES: DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING; KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS OF THE DATA PROFESSIONAL; THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS IN THE DATA SCIENCE MOVEMENT; TOOLS, TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE; DATA SCIENCE FROM THE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE; AND DATA SCIENCE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HEALTH SCIENCES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED USING BIBLIOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF PUBLICATIONS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE LIS.

DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION HAS SEEN RAPID GROWTH OVER THE PAST DECADE. TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH HANDS-ON OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH REAL DATA, MANY DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS HAVE ADVOCATED FOR AND IMPLEMENTED EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE CURRICULUM, WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN IN A WIDE VARIETY OF LITERATURE TO HAVE MANY BENEFITS. MOST EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES IN STEM PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED THROUGH CAPSTONE AND ENGINEERING DESIGN COURSES; THIS IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY THE CASE IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS AS WELL WHERE SEVERAL UNIVERSITIES HAVE DEVELOPED DATA SCIENCE CAPSTONE PROGRAMS IN WHICH STUDENTS WORK WITH CLIENTS ON THE CLIENT'S REAL-WORLD DATA SETS. WHILE CLIENT-SPONSORED CAPSTONE PROJECTS ARE AN EXEMPLAR OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING, THEY MAY POSE MAJOR CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENT AND CAN BE PARTICULARLY RESOURCE-INTENSIVE FOR INSTITUTIONS; THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE CASE IN DATA SCIENCE WHERE THE LEGALITIES OF DATA SHARING MAY COME WITH ADDITIONAL HURDLES. BECAUSE OF THIS, WE WERE MOTIVATED TO DEVELOP A NOVEL CLIENT-FACING DATA SCIENCE CONSULTING COURSE THAT PROVIDES A UNIQUE EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING SCENARIO TO BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS WHILE REQUIRING MUCH FEWER RESOURCES AND LEGALITIES. IN OUR NOVEL DATA SCIENCE CONSULTING COURSE, GROUPS OF STUDENTS WORK DIRECTLY WITH REAL CLIENTS IN A CONSULTING CLINIC SETTING TO PROVIDE DATA SCIENCE GUIDANCE AND SHORT-TERM HELP WITH DATA SCIENCE CHALLENGES. THROUGH THIS PROCESS, STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS IN DATA SCIENCE, HOW TO LEAD CONSULTATIONS WITH CLIENTS EFFECTIVELY AS A TEAM, HOW TO FRAME DATA SCIENCE CHALLENGES AND RESEARCH POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS, AND HOW TO COMMUNICATE SOLUTIONS TO CLIENTS IN REPORTS AND PRESENTATIONS. WE LEVERAGED BEST PRACTICES IN CONSULTING COURSES DEVELOPED IN BUSINESS SCHOOL SETTINGS TO DESIGN OUR COURSE. ADDITIONALLY, THE CONSULTING COURSE SERVES AS A COMMUNITY SERVICE INITIATIVE WHEREBY RESEARCHERS, CLINICIANS, NON-PROFIT AND GOVERNMENT WORKERS, AND INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS BENEFIT FROM THE ADVICE AND SHORT-TERM HELP PROVIDED THROUGH CONSULTATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE REPORT HOW OUR CONSULTING COURSE IS SET UP, HOW CLIENTS FROM BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY CAN SEEK HELP AT THE CONSULTING CLINIC, AND HOW THE STRUCTURE OF THE COURSE ENABLES STUDENTS TO HAVE FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE WORKING ON MANY REAL-WORLD DATA SCIENCE PROBLEMS WITH CLIENTS. FINALLY, WE DISCUSS HOW STUDENT PERFORMANCE IS ASSESSED IN THIS COURSE, THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM OFFERING THIS COURSE, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OTHER DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS IN UNIVERSITIES THAT WISH TO DESIGN SIMILAR COURSES.","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; CONSULTING COURSE; EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ALLEN GENEVERA I., 2021, SIGCSE '21: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 52ND ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, P516, DOI 10.1145/3408877.3432536;ANDERSON P, 2014, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 45TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION (SIGCSE'14), P145;BEIER ME, 2019, J RES SCI TEACH, V56, P3, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21465;BILE HASSAN ISMAIL, 2021, SIGCSE '21: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 52ND ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, P529, DOI 10.1145/3408877.3432443;BOOMER KB, 2007, J STAT EDUC, V15, DOI 10.1080/10691898.2007.11889542;BRUEGGE B, 2015, ACM T COMPUT EDUC, V15, DOI 10.1145/2732155;BRUNDIERS K, 2010, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V11, P308, DOI 10.1108/14676371011077540;CHENG Q, 2019, PROC FRONT EDUC CONF, DOI 10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028683;DALLIMORE E.J., 2002, BUSINESS COMMUNICATION QUARTERLY, V65, P86, DOI HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1177/108056990206500408, DOI 10.1177/108056990206500408;DE VEAUX RD, 2017, ANNU REV STAT APPL, V4, P15, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV-STATISTICS-060116-053930;HARDIN J, 2015, AM STAT, V69, P343, DOI 10.1080/00031305.2015.1077729;HERIOT KC, 2008, DECIS SCI-J INNOV ED, V6, P463, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-4609.2008.00186.X;HOOKS T., 2012, INVOLVING UNDERGRADUATES IN STATISTICAL CONSULTING, P11;HYDORN DL, 2018, J STAT EDUC, V26, P87, DOI 10.1080/10691898.2018.1475204;IRIZARRY RAFAEL A, 2020, HARV DATA SCI REV, V2, DOI 10.1162/99608F92.DD363929;JERSKY B., 2002, P 6 INT C TEACH STAT, P5;JOHNS-BOAST LYNETTE, 2013, 2013 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE), P1782, DOI 10.1109/FIE.2013.6685145;KIM H.-J., 2014, P 9 INT C TEACH STAT, P4;LASSER J, 2021, TEACH STAT, V43, PS190, DOI 10.1111/TEST.12243;LEMAIRE R, 2017, DECIS SCI-J INNOV ED, V15, P138, DOI 10.1111/DSJI.12124;MICARI M, 2021, LEARNING ENVIRON RES, V24, P123, DOI 10.1007/S10984-020-09325-Y;MILLER S., 2014, COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES NEEDED TO CLOSE THE BIG DATA SKILLS GAP;N ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE, 2018, DATA SCIENCE FOR UNDERGRADUATES OPPURTUNITES AND OPTIONS;ORDONEZ FRANCO P., 2020, P 18 LACCEI INT MULT;PREMO J, 2018, CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC, V17, DOI 10.1187/CBE.17-08-0176;RAMAMURTHY BINA., 2016, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 47TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTING SCIENCE EDUCATION, SIGCSE'16, P169, DOI DOI 10.1145/2839509.2844603;RICHTER A, 2008, J MANAG EDUC, V32, P84, DOI 10.1177/1052562907300809;ROSENTHAL S, 2020, SIGCSE 2020: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 51ST ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, P178, DOI 10.1145/3328778.3366791;SALTZ JEFFREY, 2016, THEMES SCI.

HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL TECHNIQUES LEARNERS NEED TO BECOME PROFICIENT IN ARE STILL SOMEWHAT ""IN-CONSTRUCTION"", AS THE RELATIVELY NEW FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE IS CONSTANTLY EXPANDING TO MEET NEW DATA-RELATED DEMANDS. DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION NEEDS TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE MEANS TO KEEP UP WITH THIS EXPANSION THAT FOCUS LESS ON PROFICIENCY IN SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES, BUT RATHER INTRODUCE NOVICES TO AUTHENTIC DATA PRACTICES, AND THE AUTHENTIC PURPOSES DIRECTING THE AUTHENTIC PRACTICES. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON A SPECIFIC PRACTICE, THE USE OF SIMULATIONS TO GENERATE AND EXAMINE DATA, IN THE CONTEXT OF AUTHENTIC SCIENTIFIC CITIZEN SCIENCE RESEARCH. WE PROVIDE A CASE STUDY OF ONE PAIR OF MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS' ENGAGEMENT IN AN EXTENDED LEARNING SEQUENCE INCLUDING SIMULATION ACTIVITIES INSPIRED BY AUTHENTIC DATA PRACTICES, ADAPTED TO ALSO BE AUTHENTIC FOR YOUNG STUDENTS. WHILE THE SIMULATION ACTIVITY WAS INSPIRED BY THE SCIENTISTS' PURPOSES, OUR FINDINGS ILLUSTRATE FOUR DIFFERENT ACTUAL PURPOSES THE STUDENTS ATTRIBUTED TO IT. WE ALSO SHOW THAT AS THE STUDENTS DEEPENED THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE SIMULATION, THEY GRADUALLY APPROPRIATED ITS INTENDED PURPOSE, ALONGSIDE ARTICULATING MORE MATURE VIEWS OF DATA-RELATED CONCEPTS. THE CONCLUSIONS SUMMARIZE THE FOUR DIFFERENT PURPOSES THE STUDENTS EXPRESSED AND IDENTIFY ASPECTS OF DESIGN THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE GRADUAL RE-SHAPING PROCESS OF THEIR ACTUAL PURPOSES. PRACTITIONER NOTES WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC INTRODUCING STUDENTS TO DATA SCIENCE AND STATISTICS HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL NOWADAYS. STUDENTS NEED TO BE INTRODUCED TO AUTHENTIC DATA PRACTICES, BUT ALSO TO THE AUTHENTIC PURPOSES MOTIVATING THESE PRACTICES. UTILIZING COMPUTERIZED SIMULATIONS IS A COMMON AUTHENTIC PRACTICE IN SCIENCE AND STATISTICS. THE PEDAGOGICAL, INTENDED, USE OF COMPUTERIZED SIMULATIONS CAN BE INSPIRED BY THE AUTHENTIC PURPOSES BUT SHOULD ALSO BE ADAPTED TO BE AUTHENTIC FOR THE STUDENTS. STUDENTS MAY HAVE ACTUAL PURPOSES THAT DIFFER FROM THE AUTHENTIC AND INTENDED PURPOSES. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS A CASE STUDY OF A PAIR OF MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS' ENGAGEMENT WITH A COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION TOOL, AS PART OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN A CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECT. THE STUDENTS EXPRESSED FOUR ACTUAL PURPOSES FOR THE SIMULATION. THE STUDENTS' INITIAL PURPOSES DIFFERED FROM THE INTENDED PURPOSES, LIMITING THEIR PARTICIPATION. KEY ASPECTS OF THE OVERALL ACTIVITY DESIGN ULTIMATELY SUPPORTED THE STUDENTS TO APPROPRIATE THE INTENDED PURPOSE OF THE SIMULATION AND MORE DEEPLY ENGAGE WITH THE INTENDED STATISTICAL NOTIONS. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND/OR POLICY IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT STUDENTS MAY ATTRIBUTE PURPOSES THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE OF THE TEACHER OR THE ACTIVITY DESIGNER, TO ANY LEARNING ACTIVITY THEY ENGAGE IN. MAKING THE INTENDED PURPOSES MORE EXPLICIT MAY BE HELPFUL, BUT POTENTIALLY NOT ENOUGH FOR STUDENTS TO APPROPRIATE THEM. RESEARCHERS' PROMPTS, STUDENTS' FREEDOM TO RESHAPE THEIR USE OF THE SIMULATION TOOL AND PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION NORMS CAN BE BENEFICIAL ASPECTS.","AUTHENTICITY; COMPUTERIZED-SIMULATIONS; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY; PURPOSES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"AZRIELI FOUNDATION; ISRAEL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [2678/17]","AZRIELI FOUNDATION; ISRAEL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: 2678/17","AHRWEILER P., 1998, COMPUTER SIMULATIONS, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-58270-7_3, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-58270-7_3;AINLEY J, 2006, BRIT EDUC RES J, V32, P23, DOI 10.1080/01411920500401971;ARCAVI A., 2003, EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS, V52, P215, DOI DOI 10.1023/A:1024312321077, 10.1023/A:1024312321077;ARIDOR K., 2019, TOPICS TRENDS CURREN, P71;BAKKER A., 2004, DESIGN RESEARCH IN STATISTICS EDUCATION: ON SYMBOLIZING AND COMPUTER TOOLS;BINDER K., 1995, MONTE CARLO AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS IN POLYMER SCIENCE;BLUMEL R, 1997, CHAOS ATOMIC PHYSICS;BRAHAM HM., 2017, STATISTICS EDUCATION RESEARCH JOURNAL, V16, P116, DOI 10.52041/SERJ.V16I2.187, DOI 10.52041/SERJ.V16I2.187;BUDGETT S, 2018, ZDM-MATH EDUC, V50, P1281, DOI 10.1007/S11858-018-0957-X;COBB G.

THE PRIMARY AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND HOW DSE MAY BE SCALED TO NON-SCIENCE PARTICIPANTS, PARTICULARLY USING IMMERSIVE DSE TRAINING SESSIONS THAT CULMINATED IN A DATATHON (DATA SCIENCE HACKATHON). THE IMMERSION PROGRAMME WAS BASED ON A PROJECT-BASED PEDAGOGY INFORMED BY THE CROSS INDUSTRY STANDARD PROCESS FOR DATA MINING (CRISP-DM) TO INTEGRATE DATA SCIENCE'S MULTIDISCIPLINARY NATURE. QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH WAS USED WITH 107 DATATHON PARTICIPANTS. USING VARIOUS STATISTICAL MEASURES INCLUDING EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS, THE KEY RESULTS REVEALED THAT NON-SCIENCE PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE IMMERSIONS AND DATATHON WERE SUFFICIENTLY KNOWLEDGEABLE IN ALL THE CRISP-DM COMPONENTS AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ATTENDED THE FULL DSE PROGRAMME. THIS MEANS DATA SCIENCE SKILLS CAN BE ATTAINED BY NON-STEM INDIVIDUALS BY SPENDING FOCUSED TIME IN IMMERSIONS ON A SPECIFIC DATA SCIENCE CONCEPT.

A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH, INTEGRATING FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS AND QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEYS CONDUCTED OVER THREE ROUNDS OF DATA COLLECTION, WAS EMPLOYED. THE COLLECTED DATA UNDERWENT RIGOROUS RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY ANALYSES UTILIZING SPSS SOFTWARE. AN IMPORTANCE-PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS (IPA) WAS EXECUTED TO CONSTRUCT A PERFORMANCE CHART, EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A 24-ITEM FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO ENCOMPASS KEY ASPECTS OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. THE INITIAL INTERNAL CONSISTENCY Α COEFFICIENTS FOR QUESTIONNAIRE 2 AND QUESTIONNAIRE 3 WERE FOUND TO BE .892 AND .913, RESPECTIVELY, SURPASSING THE 0.7 THRESHOLD, INDICATING A HIGH LEVEL OF RELIABILITY FOR ALL ITEMS RELATED TO DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES. THE KAISER-MEYER-OLKIN (KMO) MEASUREMENTS APPROACHING APPROXIMATELY 0.9 AFFIRMED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE, SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO GAUGE THE RELEVANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DATA SCIENCE-RELATED INDICATORS IN THE CONTEXT OF APPLIED TALENT CULTIVATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY UNDERSCORES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF INDICATORS SUCH AS TEAMWORK, REGIONAL MARKET RESEARCH, AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION WITHIN THE DOMAIN OF DATA SCIENCE. IT IDENTIFIES GAPS BETWEEN KEY INDICATORS AND LOWER-PERFORMING INDICATORS, PROPOSING STRATEGIC IMPROVEMENT MEASURES TO ENHANCE THE ALIGNMENT OF APPLIED TALENT CULTIVATION OBJECTIVES WITH THE EVOLVING NEEDS OF REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY IN THE DATA SCIENCE LANDSCAPE. THE RESEARCH FINDINGS NOT ONLY CONTRIBUTE TO A FOUNDATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES IN APPLIED TALENT CULTIVATION BUT ALSO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR INNOVATIVE REFORMS IN FUTURE TALENT CULTIVATION MODELS. BY CLARIFYING OBJECTIVES AND BETTER ALIGNING THEM WITH THE DYNAMIC DEMANDS OF REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THIS STUDY SETS THE STAGE FOR TRANSFORMATIVE ADVANCEMENTS IN THE FIELD OF APPLIED TALENT CULTIVATION, PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE REALM OF DATA SCIENCE. © AUTHORS RETAIN ALL COPYRIGHTS.","APPLIED TALENT CULTIVATION; DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES; IMPORTANCE-PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS (IPA); REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT","","","","","","","","BIAN Y.

HOWEVER, IN CONVENTIONAL EDUCATION SYSTEMS, COMPUTING & QUANTITATIVE, AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS ARE OFTEN TAUGHT IN DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES. DATA STORYTELLING IS CONSTRUCTING AND PRESENTING DATA STORIES TO HIGHLIGHT THE ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS TO ACHIEVE THE COMMUNICATION GOALS TO A SPECIFIC AUDIENCE. DIGITAL DATA STORYTELLING LEVERAGES DIGITAL STORYTELLING TECHNIQUES AND BEST PRACTICES IN COMMUNICATION TO DELIVER STORIES THAT CAN BE SHARED IN DIGITAL FORMATS TO A WIDE AUDIENCE. IN THIS PAPER, WE DESCRIBE AND REFLECT ON A SEMESTER-LONG PROJECT-BASED LEARNING PILOT USING DIGITAL STORYTELLING AS A FRAMEWORK TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO EXPLORE TOPICS THEMED AROUND HUMAN FLOURISHING AND SUSTAINABILITY WITH THE END GOAL OF CONSTRUCTING DATA STORIES DELIVERED IN DIGITAL OR VIDEO FORMAT (I.E., DIGITAL DATA STORYTELLING). THE PILOT WORK WAS CONDUCTED IN AN INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE COURSE AT A 4-YEAR MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTION IN COLLABORATION WITH STUDENTS STUDYING NON-STEM DISCIPLINES AT A PARTNER COMMUNITY COLLEGE. OUR PILOT DEMONSTRATES THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF THIS SUSTAINABILITY-AWARE PROJECT-BASED LEARNING DESIGN IN RAISING STUDENTS’ AWARENESS OF SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES, INCREASING CONFIDENCE IN CROSS-DISCIPLINARY COMMUNICATION COMPETENCY, AND AT THE SAME TIME DEEPENING THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF DATA SCIENCE CONCEPTS. WE FURTHER REFLECT ON THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM MODEL AS WELL AS CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUILDING TRANSDISCIPLINARY COMMUNICATION COMPETENCY TO PREPARE FOR A DIVERSE DATA SCIENCE WORKFORCE. © 2023, AALBORG UNIVERSITY PRESS.

IN THIS STUDY, WE ASCERTAINED THE IMPACT OF DATA SCIENCE AND AI EDUCATION ON LEARNERS’ MOTIVATION AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT BY ANALYZING A LECTURE-STYLE COURSE OFFERED AS PART OF MATHEMATICAL AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AT TOKYO CITY UNIVERSITY, JAPAN. THE COURSE ANALYZED WAS DATA SCIENCE LITERACY 1 (DS1). THE ANALYSIS PERIOD SPANNED THREE ACADEMIC YEARS, FROM 2020 TO 2022. THE ANALYZED ITEMS WERE THREE MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS DERIVED FROM EXPECTANCY-VALUE THEORY, NAMELY INTRINSIC VALUE, ATTAINMENT UTILITY VALUE, AND EXPECTATIONS FOR SUCCESS. A FOURTH FACTOR, CAREER DEVELOPMENT, WAS ALSO ANALYZED. WE COLLECTED DATA PERTAINING TO THE FOUR FACTORS, THAT IS, THE THREE ABOVE MENTIONED MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT, THROUGH QUESTIONNAIRES ADMINISTERED TO DS1 LEARNERS. REGARDING DATA ANALYSIS, LEARNERS WERE CLAS-SIFIED ACCORDING TO THE VALUES (HIGH VS. LOW) THEY REPORTED FOR EACH OF THE FOUR FACTORS OF INTEREST AT THE BEGINNING OF THE COURSE. THESE WERE COMPARED TO THE VALUES REPORTED AT THE END OF THE COURSE. RESULTS SHOWED INCREASES IN ALL THE MOTIVATION FACTORS. THE INCREASING TREND WAS PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED AMONG LEARNERS WHO INITIALLY REPORTED LOW VALUES. ALTHOUGH TRENDS DIFFERED FROM YEAR TO YEAR, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DATA SCIENCE AND AI EDUCATION CAN POSITIVELY IMPACT MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS AND RELATED CAREER DEVELOPMENT. © 2023, ICIC INTERNATIONAL.

IT IS VITAL TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE NECESSARY LEARNING RESOURCES. WHILE GENDER BIAS IN STEM HAS RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION, RESEARCH ON RACIAL BIAS IS RELATIVELY LIMITED, AND THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF GENDER AND RACIAL BIASES IN DATA SCIENCE REMAIN LARGELY UNEXPLORED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THESE BIASES IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION BY EXAMINING THE PREFERENCES OF 300 DIVERSE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN DATA SCIENCE RELATED CLASSES, WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THEIR PREFERENCES REGARDING TEACHING PRACTICES AND METHODS. THE IMPACT OF RACE AND GENDER IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IS AN IMPORTANT AREA OF STUDY THAT HAS GAINED INCREASED ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS. RACE AND GENDER PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN REPRESENTATION WITHIN THE DATA SCIENCE COMMUNITY. STEREOTYPES AND BIASES CAN INFLUENCE THE EXPERIENCES OF INDIVIDUALS FROM DIFFERENT RACIAL AND GENDER BACKGROUNDS WITHIN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. RACE AND GENDER CAN IMPACT DATA SCIENCE PEDAGOGY IN VARIOUS WAYS, INFLUENCING INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES, CONTENT DELIVERY, AND STUDENT EXPERIENCES. USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO UNDERSTAND BIASED PEDAGOGY IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION CAN BE A VALUABLE APPROACH TO UNCOVER PATTERNS AND INSIGHTS. WE PROPOSE AN EFFECTIVE UNSUPERVISED LEARNING APPROACH TO EXAMINE THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN PREFERRED PEDAGOGICAL METHODS AND GENDER-RACIAL BACKGROUND OF THE PARTICIPATING STUDENTS. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT STUDENT'S GENDER HAS A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WITH LEARNING STYLE; E.G., FEMALE STUDENTS PREFER MORE PRIVATE METHODS OF INTERACTION WITH TAS AND INSTRUCTORS, SUCH AS ANONYMOUS POLLS AND ZOOM MEETINGS. FURTHERMORE, OUR STUDY UNCOVERS SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN RACE, GENDER, AND LEARNING STYLES, SHOWING THAT ASIAN STUDENTS EXHIBIT HIGHER LEVELS OF CLASSROOM INTERACTION AND GROUP ASSIGNMENT PREFERENCE THAN THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. THESE FINDINGS ARE CRUCIAL FOR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATORS SEEKING TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS RACIAL AND GENDER BIASES, PROMOTING A MORE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY FOR UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES. RECOGNIZING THESE INFLUENCES ENABLES EDUCATORS TO IMPLEMENT TARGETED STRATEGIES FOR A SUPPORTIVE AND ENGAGING EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE FOR ALL STUDENTS. © 2023 IEEE.","","ASSOCIATION REACTIONS; COMPUTER AIDED INSTRUCTION; DATA SCIENCE; LEARNING SYSTEMS; COMBINED EFFECT; GENDER BIAS; GENDER EQUITY; GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES; LEARNING RESOURCE; LEARNINGSTYLES; RACIAL BIAS; SCIENCE EDUCATION; STEM FIELDS; TEACHING PRACTICES; STUDENTS","","","","","","","ARGYRIOU P., BENAMAR K., NIKOLAJEVA M., WHAT TO BLEND?

THE RESEARCH TEAM IS PARTNERING WITH A LOCAL PUBLIC STEM HIGH SCHOOL TO DESIGN, EVALUATE, AND PUBLICLY SHARE AN ENRICHMENT COURSE THAT INTRODUCES STUDENTS TO DATA ANALYTICS IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. INTEGRATING DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH WILL ENABLE STUDENTS TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL DATA-DRIVEN PROBLEM SOLVING WHILE PROMOTING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. A KEY CHALLENGE IN INTRODUCING DATA SKILLS IN K-12 IS ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO ACCESS. TO COPE WITH THESE BARRIERS, THE COURSE DESIGN INCORPORATES THE USE OF SPREADSHEETS TO ENGAGE STUDENTS IN COMPUTATIONAL THINKING.

A DIGITAL DIVIDE SEPARATES SCIENTISTS WHO ACCELERATE THEIR SCIENCE USING LARGE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE FROM THOSE WHO DO NOT, OR WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE COMPUTE RESOURCES OR LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP THE SKILLS NEEDED. THE EXCLUSIONARY NATURE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THREATENS EQUITY AND THE FUTURE OF INNOVATION BY LEAVING PEOPLE OUT OF THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS WHILE OVER-AMPLIFYING THE VOICES OF A SMALL GROUP WHO HAVE RESOURCES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS: RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN PUBLIC RESEARCH CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE AND RESOURCES DEVELOPED DURING THE OPEN SCIENCE REVOLUTION ARE PROVIDING TOOLS THAT CAN HELP BRIDGE THIS DIVIDE. THESE TOOLS CAN ENABLE ACCESS TO FAST AND POWERFUL COMPUTATION WITH MODEST INTERNET CONNECTIONS AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS. HERE WE CONTRIBUTE ANOTHER RESOURCE FOR NARROWING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE: SCALABLE VIRTUAL MACHINES RUNNING ON PUBLIC CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE. WE DESCRIBE THE TOOLS, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND METHODS THAT ENABLED SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT OF A REPRODUCIBLE AND SCALABLE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE ARCHITECTURE FOR A COLLABORATIVE DATA SYNTHESIS WORKING GROUP IN FEBRUARY 2023. THIS PLATFORM ENABLED 45 SCIENTISTS WITH VARYING DATA AND COMPUTE SKILLS TO LEVERAGE 40,000 HOURS OF COMPUTE TIME OVER A 4-DAY WORKSHOP. OUR APPROACH PROVIDES AN OPEN FRAMEWORK THAT CAN BE REPLICATED FOR EDUCATIONAL AND COLLABORATIVE DATA SYNTHESIS EXPERIENCES IN ANY DATA- AND COMPUTE-INTENSIVE DISCIPLINE.  © 2023 OWNER/AUTHOR.","CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE; DIGITAL EQUITY; OPEN SCIENCE; TEAM SCIENCE","E-LEARNING; OPEN DATA; CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE; DATA SYNTHESIS; DIGITAL DIVIDE; DIGITAL EQUITY; ENVIRONMENTAL DATA; MODERN SCIENCE; OPEN SCIENCE; PUBLIC RESEARCH; SCIENCE EDUCATION; TEAM SCIENCE; PERSONAL COMPUTERS","","","","","CU BOULDER’S GRAND CHALLENGE INITIATIVE; ESIIL; NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, (DBI-0735191, DBI-1265383, DBI-1743442, DBI-2153040, DEB-1846384, DEB-2017889, OAC-2137603, OAC-2138259, OAC-2138286, OAC-2138296, OAC-2138307); INDIANA UNIVERSITY, IU, (BIO220085); COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, CIRES; EARTHLAB, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON","FUNDING TEXT 1: THE WORKING GROUP WAS SUPPORTED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL DATA SYNTHESIS INNOVATION AND INCLUSION LAB (ESIIL, NSF AWARD DBI-2153040) AND ADDITIONAL NSF GRANTS DEB-2017889 AND DEB-1846384.

IN COLLABORATION WITH 17 EXPERTS, SELECTED THROUGH PURPOSIVE SAMPLING, AND INVOLVING 100 INSTRUCTORS WITHIN SICHUAN, CHINA, THIS RESEARCH EXPLORES AN INSTRUCTIONAL MODEL DESIGNED TO FOSTER SELF-REGULATED LEARNING IN THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE. THE DELPHI DATA COLLECTION METHOD IS EMPLOYED TO INVESTIGATE THE RELEVANCE OF VARIOUS LEARNING THEORIES WITHIN INTERNATIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION IN SICHUAN PROVINCE, CHINA, WITH A SPECIFIC EMPHASIS ON THE DATA SCIENCE DISCIPLINE. THE SELF-REGULATED LEARNING IN INTERNATIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION (SLR-IHE) MODEL, INFORMED BY SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRES, ADDRESSES PERTINENT CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, INCLUDING ISSUES RELATED TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY, FACULTY TRAINING, CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT, FACULTY MOBILITY, CROSS-BORDER REGULATIONS, AND FUNDING CONSTRAINTS. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION (IHE) MODEL FOR SICHUAN PROVINCE, CHINA, USING THE DELPHI TECHNIQUE, WHICH CONSISTS OF FOUR DISTINCT INSTRUCTIONAL MODULES. THROUGH A LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF THE SLR-IHE MODEL, IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT THE SELF-REGULATED LEARNING PROCESS IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION COMPRISES FOUR ESSENTIAL STAGES, EACH CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACQUISITION OF DISTINCT GOALS. THESE STAGES INCLUDE: (1) ACTIVATING PRIOR KNOWLEDGE; (2) FOSTERING IDEA EXCHANGE AND ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENT; (3) BUILDING ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE THROUGH UNDERSTANDING, MEMORIZATION, ANALYSIS, AND TRANSFER; AND (4) GENERATING INNOVATIVE IDEAS THROUGH REFLEXIVE THINKING AND INITIATING CREATIVE THOUGHT PROCESSES. THESE STAGES COLLECTIVELY SUPPORT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SPECIFIC GOALS ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-MANAGED LEARNING (SML), SELF-REGULATED LEARNING (SRL), SELF-PACED LEARNING (SPL), AND SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING (SDL) IN THE CONTEXT OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. THIS COMPREHENSIVE INSTRUCTIONAL MODEL FOR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT IN SICHUAN PROVINCE, CHINA, EMPHASIZES GLOBALIZATION, COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH AS KEY DRIVERS FOR ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION IN THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE. © 2023, BRIGHT PUBLISHER.

DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF INDUSTRIES IS FUELING AN EXPONENTIAL GROWTH IN GLOBAL DATASPHERE, ENABLED BY ADVANCES IN DATA-MEASURING SMART DEVICES, INTERNET OF THINGS AND CLOUD COMPUTING. THE OIL/GAS SECTOR IS NOT LEFT OUT OF THE DATA REVOLUTION. A RECENT REPORT INDICATED THAT ABOUT 80,000 SENSORS GENERATE 2 TERABYTES/DAY DATA ON AN AVERAGE OFFSHORE PLATFORM. THE NEED TO TRANSFORM OILFIELD DATA INTO INSIGHTS FOR OPTIMAL DECISION-MAKING IS OPENING UP CAREER FRONTIERS IN PETROLEUM DATA SCIENCE. AN INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR TALENTS IN PETROLEUM DATA SCIENCE IS IN VIEW. IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS, THE DATA SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ANALYTICS TECHNICAL SECTION OF THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS, AFRICAN REGION IS COLLABORATING WITH THE ACADEMIA, TOWARDS PRODUCING GRADUATE ENGINEERS POSSESSING DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE AND DATA MINING SKILLS. AS PART OF THE COLLABORATION, WE NOW PRESENT A FRAMEWORK FOR THE INCORPORATION OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION INTO PETROLEUM ENGINEERING UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS. IN LINE WITH OUTCOME-BASED EDUCATION APPROACH, A SET OF LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR A PROPOSED PETROLEUM DATA ANALYTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING COURSE IS PRESENTED, FIRST. THESE LEARNING OUTCOMES ARE FRAMED AS SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES EXPECTED OF STUDENTS AT COURSE COMPLETION. THEREAFTER, ASSESSMENT RUBRICS AND USE CASE EXAMPLES ARE MAPPED TO EACH LEARNING OUTCOME. THESE RUBRICS SERVES AS EVIDENTIAL BASIS FOR ASCERTAINING THAT THE SKILLS HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED. IN COMPLETING THE CURRICULUM DESIGN, A SEQUENCE OF LESSON AND LAB MODULES ARE ENLISTED AS CONTENTS OVER WHICH LEARNERS MUST GAIN MASTERY IN ORDER TO MEET THE CRITERIA OF THE ASSESSMENT RUBRICS. FURTHERMORE, VARIOUS ELEMENTS THAT MAKE UP AN INTEGRATED LEARNING EXPERIENCE ARE PRESENTED. THESE INCLUDE OPEN-ACCESS LEARNING RESOURCES AND TOOLBOX, OPEN-ACCESS DATA SOURCES, INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES, CAPSTONE PROJECT IDEAS, RESEARCH PROSPECTS, AND INDUSTRY SUPPORT (MENTORSHIP AND ADVISORY). THE FUTURE PROSPECTS OF THIS INITIATIVE ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. SOME ELEMENTS OF THIS FRAMEWORK, AS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER, ARE CURRENTLY BEING IMPLEMENTED IN A QUASI-CLASSROOM SETTING; PRELIMINARY PERFORMANCE REPORTS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS PAPER.

IN INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE COURSES, HOWEVER, STUDENTS HAVE FOUND THESE TRANSFORMATIONS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING TO LEARN. ONE COMPLEX TRANSFORMATION IS THE PIVOT TRANSFORMATION, WHICH REORGANIZES A TABLE BASED ON AGGREGATION AND SUMMARIZING ALONG SELECTED COLUMNS AND ROWS. CURRENT ASSESSMENTS TEST STUDENT UNDERSTANDING IN STATIC SCENARIOS. THUS, THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP STUDENTS EXPLICITLY WORK THROUGH THE STEPS AND VARIABLES NEEDED TO EXPRESS A PIVOT TRANSFORMATION IN A RANDOMIZABLE MANNER. AS SUCH, WE EXPLORE WHETHER A DYNAMIC DIGITAL ASSESSMENT FOR THE PIVOT TRANSFORMATION CAN EFFECTIVELY ACHIEVE MASTERY LEARNING TOWARDS THIS SKILL. OUR DESIGN IS INSPIRED BY PARSONS PROBLEMS, IN WHICH ANSWER COMPONENTS (PIVOT TABLE OUTPUT LABELS AND VALUES) CAN BE COMPOSED INTO THE OUTPUT OF A PIVOT TRANSFORMATION. A QUESTION CAN BE DERIVED FROM A SMALL RANDOMIZED DATASET, AND RANDOMIZED PANDAS CODE THAT OPERATES UPON THE DATASET AND CAN BE AUTOGRADED. WE PLAN TO CONDUCT A PILOT STUDY WITH DATA SCIENCE STUDENTS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER 1) USING A PROGRAMMABLE ONLINE PLATFORM TO PRACTICE PIVOT TABLES HELPS IMPROVE PERFORMANCE ON EXAMS, AND 2) RANDOMIZATION AND INSTANT FEEDBACK ON THE ONLINE PLATFORM CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED STUDENT LEARNING. © 2024 OWNER/AUTHOR.","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; EDUCATIONAL TOOLS; MASTERY LEARNING","DATA SCIENCE; EDUCATION COMPUTING; 'CURRENT; COMPLEX TRANSFORMATIONS; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; EDUCATIONAL TOOLS; LEARN+; MASTERY LEARNING; ONLINE PLATFORMS; PIVOT-TABLES; SCIENCE COURSE; SCIENCE EDUCATION; STUDENTS","","","","","","","ALKHABAZ R., LI Z., YANG S., ALAWINI A., STUDENT'S LEARNING CHALLENGES WITH RELATIONAL, DOCUMENT, AND GRAPH QUERY LANGUAGES, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2ND INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON DATA SYSTEMS EDUCATION: BRIDGING EDUCATION PRACTICE WITH EDUCATION RESEARCH (SEATTLE, WA, USA) (DATAED '23), PP. 30-36, (2023); BERMAN F., RUTENBAR R., HAILPERN B., CHRISTENSEN H., DAVIDSON S., ESTRIN D., FRANKLIN M., MARTONOSI M., RAGHAVAN P., STODDEN V., SZALAY A.S., REALIZING THE POTENTIAL OF DATA SCIENCE, COMMUN.

ALTHOUGH THE REPRESENTATIONAL FORMS CHOSEN BY STUDENTS WERE MAINLY TRADITIONAL, OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THEY WERE ENGAGED IN AUTHENTIC DATA VISUALIZATION PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THEIR PROGRAMMING PROCESS. THESE PRACTICES INCLUDED TRANSLATING IDEAS INTO PROGRAMS, SELECTING PARAMETERS (SUCH AS COLOR SCHEME AND SPACE BETWEEN DATA POINTS), INSPECTING THE OUTPUT, AND ADDING ANNOTATIONS TO PROVIDE CONTEXT AND BETTER COMMUNICATE THE DESIRED INFORMATION.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS FAILED TO DISTINGUISH TWO FEATURES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH EMBODIMENT: SENSORIMOTOR ENGAGEMENT AND VISUOSPATIAL CONCRETENESS. IN THE CURRENT RESEARCH, WE ASK WHETHER SENSORIMOTOR ENGAGEMENT—OPERATIONALIZED AS WATCHING A VIDEO OF HANDS MANIPULATING PAPER REPRESENTATIONS—OFFERS UNIQUE BENEFITS BEYOND THE VISUOSPATIAL CONCRETENESS OF A DYNAMIC VISUALIZATION OF THE SAME PROCESS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE CONDITIONS TO LEARN ABOUT THE SHUFFLE() FUNCTION IN R: A WATCH HANDSMOVING OBJECTS GROUP, WHICH WATCHED A VIDEO WITH HANDS; A WATCH MOVING OBJECTS GROUP, WHICH WATCHED A VIDEO WITH A DYNAMIC VISUALIZATION IN WHICH OBJECTS MOVED WITHOUT HANDS; OR A CONTROL GROUP, WHICH WATCHED A LIVE-CODING VIDEO THAT DID NOT INCLUDE EITHER HANDS OR VISUOSPATIAL REPRESENTATIONS. RESULTS REVEALED THAT ONLY PARTICIPANTS IN THE WATCH HANDS MOVING OBJECTS GROUP DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE COMPARED WITH BOTH THE WATCH MOVING OBJECTS GROUP AND CONTROL GROUPS. THESE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE UNIQUE BENEFIT OF SENSORIMOTOR ENGAGEMENT FOR LEARNING, CONTRIBUTING TO A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW EMBODIMENT CAN ENHANCE THE LEARNING PROCESS. © 2024 THE AUTHOR(S)","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; DYNAMIC VISUALIZATION; EMBODIED COGNITION; MULTIMEDIA LEARNING; SENSORIMOTOR ENGAGEMENT","ADULT; FEMALE; HAND; HUMANS; LEARNING; MALE; PSYCHOMOTOR PERFORMANCE; VISUAL PERCEPTION; YOUNG ADULT; ADULT; FEMALE; HAND; HUMAN; LEARNING; MALE; PHYSIOLOGY; PSYCHOMOTOR PERFORMANCE; VISION; YOUNG ADULT","","","","","CHAN ZUCKERBERG INITIATIVE, CZI; SILICON VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION, SVCF, (DRL-1229004); SILICON VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION, SVCF; GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH, OPR, (OPR18115); GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH, OPR","THE AUTHORS HAVE NO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST TO DECLARE.

IN THIS PAPER, WE DISCUSS THE CENTRALITY OF API (APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE) LOOKUP TO DATA WRAN-GLING, AND HOW AN ONTOLOGY-STRUCTURED COMMAND MENU COULD FACILITATE IT. WE DESIGN THUMBNAIL GRAPHICS AS VISUAL ALTERNATIVES TO EXPLAINING DATA WRANGLING OPERATIONS AND USE A SURVEY TO VALIDATE THEIR QUALITY. WE FURTHERMORE PREDICT THAT THUMBNAIL GRAPHICS MAKE THE MENU MORE NAVIGABLE, IMPROVING LOOKUP E_CIENCY AND PERFORMANCE. OUR PREDICTIONS ARE TESTED USING SLICE N DICE, AN ONLINE DATA WRANGLING TUTORIAL PLATFORM THAT COLLECTS LEARNER ACTIVITY. IT INCLUDES BOTH NON-PROGRAMMATIC AND PROGRAMMATIC DATA WRANGLING EXERCISES. PARTICIPANTS FROM A MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL SAMPLE (N=200) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED THE TUTORIAL EITHER WITH OR WITHOUT THUMBNAIL GRAPHICS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THUMBNAIL GRAPHICS REDUCE THE NEED FOR CLARI_CATIONS, THEREBY ASSISTING API LOOKUP FOR NOVICES LEARNING DATA WRANGLING. WE FURTHER PRESENT SOME NEGATIVE RESULTS REGARDING PERFORMANCE GAIN AND FOLLOW UP WITH A DISCUSSION ON WHY THE DI_ERENCES ARE SUBTLE AND HOW THEY CAN BE IMPROVED. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, WE COMPLEMENT OUR STATISTICAL RESULTS WITH A QUALITATIVE STUDY WHERE WE RECEIVE POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM OUR PARTICIPANTS ON THE DESIGN AND HELPFULNESS OF THE THUMBNAIL GRAPHICS. © AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES.

IT ADDRESSES THE SHIFT IN EDUCATIONAL PARADIGMS TOWARD A COMPETENCY-FOCUSED SYSTEM, HIGHLIGHTING THE TRANSITION FROM TRADITIONAL TEACHING METHODS TO ACTIVE LEARNING AND FACILITATION IN CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION, ESPECIALLY IN ENGINEERING. THE PAPER INTRODUCES EDUINFORMATICS, A NEW INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELD THAT MERGES INFORMATICS WITH EDUCATION, AS A CRUCIAL TOOL FOR TACKLING EMERGING EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES. FOCUSING ON THE “MANABURU” COURSE AT KOBE TOKIWA UNIVERSITY, THE STUDY EXPLORES HOW METHODS DERIVED FROM SPORTS SCIENCE, SUCH AS KINESTHESIS, SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE INTRINSIC STUDENT MOTIVATION. KEY STRATEGIES INCLUDE CREATING POSITIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS, UNDERSTANDING STUDENT PERSPECTIVES, AND PROMOTING PEER TEACHING. THE STUDY EMPHASIZES THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF FACILITATORS IN ACTIVE LEARNING, FOCUSING ON THE PROCESS RATHER THAN THE OUTCOME. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS FROM EDUINFORMATICS SUBSTANTIATES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE METHODS IN IMPROVING MOTIVATION AND LEARNING OUTCOMES IN FIRST-YEAR EDUCATION, SHOWCASING THE APPLICABILITY OF SPORTS AND EXERCISE INSTRUCTION IN ACTIVE LEARNING-BASED STEAM/DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. © THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO SPRINGER NATURE SINGAPORE PTE LTD. 2025.","EDUINFORMATICS; INDUSTRY 5.0; SOCIETY5.0; SPORTS AND EXERCISE INSTRUCTION; STEAM/DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION","MOTIVATION; STEAM ENGINEERING; ACTIVE LEARNING; EDUCATIONAL APPROACH; EDUINFORMATIC; INDUSTRY 5.0; INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELDS; SCIENCE EDUCATION; SOCIETY5.0; SPORT AND EXERCISE INSTRUCTION; STEAM/DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; TEACHING METHODS; ACTIVE LEARNING","","","","","SINGAPORE UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN, SUTD; JAPAN SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCE, JSPS, (20K10653); JAPAN SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCE, JSPS","THIS WORK IS SUPPORTED BY JSPS KAKENHI GRANT NUMBER 20K10653.

FOR YOUTH GROWING UP IN AN INCREASINGLY DATA-DRIVEN SOCIETY, IT IS CRITICAL THEY HAVE FOUNDATIONAL DATA LITERACY SKILLS. A CENTRAL COMPONENT OF DATA LITERACY IS THE ABILITY TO COLLECT, ANALYZE, VISUALIZE, AND MAKE MEANING FROM DATA. ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES ARE MEDIATED AND SHAPED BY THE TOOLS THAT YOUTH USE TO CARRY OUT THESE DATA PRACTICES. GIVEN THE ESSENTIAL ROLE TOOLS PLAY IN ENABLING AND SUPPORTING YOUTH IN ENGAGING WITH AND INTERPRETING DATA, UNDERSTANDING WHAT TOOLS ARE USED AND HOW THEY ARE USED IN EDUCATIONAL CONTEXTS WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW YOUTH ARE BEING PREPARED TO BE DATA-LITERATE CITIZENS.

IN THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY, WE AIMED TO UNDERSTAND (A) WHAT APT EPISTEMIC PROCESSES WITHIN DATA LITERACY LOOK LIKE IN PRACTICE WITH CHILDREN, AND (B) TO WHAT EXTENT A CURRICULUM BUILT ON A SIMULATION-BASED DATA ANALYSIS INTERVENTION (WHERE STUDENTS ENGAGE IN EXPERIMENTATION AND DATA ANALYSES THROUGH THE USE OF SIMULATIONS) PROMOTES THE EPISTEMIC PROCESSES OF DATA LITERACY. WE USED THE APT-AIR FRAMEWORK, WHICH EXPOUNDS ON THE COMPONENTS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL EPISTEMIC EDUCATION, AS A TOOL TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS’ APT EPISTEMIC PROCESSES. THE RESULTS ILLUSTRATE THAT ELEMENTARY STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO ACTIVATE COGNITIVE, EMOTIONAL, AND—TO A LESSER EXTENT—METACOGNITIVE AND COLLABORATIVE EPISTEMIC PROCESSES RELATED TO DATA LITERACY SKILLS IN THIS CONTEXT. ADDITIONALLY, THE DESIGN FEATURES EMBEDDED IN THE EXPERIMENTATION LESSON WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN ENGAGING STUDENTS IN APT EPISTEMIC PROCESSES; YET THE DATA ANALYSIS LESSON, WHILE ENGAGING STUDENTS IN FEWER PROCESSES OVERALL, WAS SUCCESSFUL IN PROMOTING STUDENTS’ ABILITY TO MAKE ACCURATE INFERENCES USING AN AGGREGATE VIEW OF DATA. WE DISCUSS THE TRENDS IN THE APT EPISTEMIC PROCESSES RELATED TO DATA LITERACY THAT EMERGED AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR INSTRUCTION AND LEARNING. © 2023, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO SPRINGER NATURE B.V.","APT-AIR FRAMEWORK; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; INFORMAL STATISTICAL INFERENCE; SIMULATIONS","","","","","","LITZSINGER ROAD ECOLOGY FOUNDATION; NSF-DRL; NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, (1513043); NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF","FUNDING TEXT 1: THIS RESEARCH WAS LARGELY FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, GRANT NUMBER 1513043, AND, IN PART, BY THE LITZSINGER ROAD ECOLOGY FOUNDATION.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE AUTHORS REPORT ON AN ANALYSIS OF THREE STUDENT CASES FROM A DESIGN STUDY IN WHICH MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL YOUTH ASSEMBLED FAMILY MIGRATION STORIES USING DATA VISUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES WITH SOCIOECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC DATA. THE AUTHORS USED INTERACTION ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE HOW STUDENTS RESPONDED TO MISALIGNMENTS THEY ENCOUNTERED BETWEEN THEIR FAMILIES’ EXPERIENCES AND DATA TRENDS IN THEIR MODELS, DRAWING ON THE THEORETICAL CONSTRUCT OF EPISTEMIC DATA AGENCY. FINDINGS: THIS CASE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES WAYS IN WHICH STUDENTS ENACTED EPISTEMIC DATA AGENCY. INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT CAN HELP STUDENTS DEEPEN INQUIRY AND AVOID CERTAIN PITFALLS, SUCH AS ENCODING DATA IN UNSOUND OR MISLEADING WAYS TO SUPPORT A PARTICULAR STORY, WHILE ENCOURAGING STUDENTS TO SEE THEMSELVES AS AN EPISTEMIC AUTHORITY ON PAR WITH DATA. THIS STUDY OPENS PATHWAYS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH THAT CONSIDERS HOW DATA CAN SHAPE PERSONAL NARRATIVES AND HOW STUDENTS CAN LEVERAGE THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE STORIES THEY TELL WITH DATA. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE AUTHORS INTRODUCE THE CONSTRUCT OF EPISTEMIC DATA AGENCY TO DESCRIBE THE CONCEPTUAL AND MATERIAL PRACTICES THAT REVEAL AND SHAPE STUDENTS’ RELATIONSHIPS TO THE DATA. THE DESCRIPTIONS OF STUDENTS ENACTING EPISTEMIC DATA AGENCY IN ASSEMBLING DATA STORIES INFORMS THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO BETTER ELEVATE AND RECOGNIZE STUDENTS’ EFFORTS IN RELATION TO DISCIPLINARY NORMS AND SUPPORT DEEPER, MEANINGFUL STUDENT LEARNING WITH AND ABOUT DATA. © 2024, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.","DATA LITERACY; DATA PRACTICES; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; DATA VISUALIZATION; EPISTEMIC AGENCY; STORYTELLING","","","","","","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, (1341882, 1949110)","FUNDING: THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION UNDER GRANT#1341882 AND #1949110.

OUR FINDINGS INDICATE A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN HIGHER STUDENT GRADES AND MORE DETAILED, POSITIVE PEER REVIEWS, AS MEASURED BY WORD COUNT, SENTIMENT, AND KEYWORD MATCHES. WHILE THE OVERALL CHANGES IN ENGAGEMENT METRICS WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, TRENDS SUGGEST INCREASED ENGAGEMENT OVER TIME. THESE FINDINGS CONTRIBUTE TO A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PEER REVIEW IN ONLINE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS AND HIGHLIGHT ITS POTENTIAL TO FOSTER STUDENT DEVELOPMENT IN DATA SCIENCE.

RESEARCH IS NEEDED ABOUT THE DESIGN OF TASKS THAT SUPPORT HIGH SCHOOL STATISTICS TEACHERS TO LEARN NEW STATISTICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES SUCH AS DIGITAL IMAGE ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION MODELS. USING OUR DESIGN FRAMEWORK, THE CONSTRUCTION OF A TASK IS DESCRIBED THAT INTRODUCES CLASSIFICATION MODELING USING GRAYSCALE DIGITAL IMAGES. THE TASK WAS IMPLEMENTED WITHIN A TEACHING EXPERIMENT INVOLVING SIX HIGH SCHOOL STATISTICS TEACHERS.

AS A RESULT, THERE IS A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH REGARDING HOW TO TEACH INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION SKILLS. HOWEVER, MUCH OF THE WORK EVALUATING METHODS OF TEACHING STATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE COLLABORATION RELIES PRIMARILY ON SELF-REFLECTION DATA. ADDITIONALLY, PRIOR RESEARCH LACKS DETAILED METHODS FOR ASSESSING THE QUALITY OF COLLABORATION SKILLS. IN THIS CASE STUDY, WE PRESENT A METHOD FOR TEACHING STATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE COLLABORATION, A FRAMEWORK FOR IDENTIFYING ELEMENTS OF EFFECTIVE COLLABORATION, AND A COMPARATIVE CASE STUDY TO EVALUATE THE COLLABORATION SKILLS OF BOTH A TEAM OF STUDENTS AND AN EXPERIENCED COLLABORATOR ON TWO COMPONENTS OF EFFECTIVE DATA SCIENCE COLLABORATION: STRUCTURING A COLLABORATION MEETING AND COMMUNICATING WITH A DOMAIN EXPERT. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE STUDENTS COULD FACILITATE MEETINGS AND COMMUNICATE COMPARABLY WELL TO THE EXPERIENCED COLLABORATOR, BUT THAT THE EXPERIENCED COLLABORATOR WAS BETTER ABLE TO FACILITATE MEETINGS AND COMMUNICATE TO DEVELOP STRONG RELATIONSHIPS, AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT FOR HIGH-QUALITY AND LONG-TERM COLLABORATION. FURTHER WORK IS NEEDED TO GENERALIZE THESE FINDINGS TO A LARGER POPULATION, BUT THESE RESULTS BEGIN TO INFORM THE FIELD REGARDING EFFECTIVE WAYS TO TEACH SPECIFIC DATA SCIENCE COLLABORATION SKILLS. © 2023 THE AUTHOR(S).

WHILE THESE STUDIES ILLUMINATE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF STUDENTS’ PROGRAMMING BEHAVIOR OR CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING, A METHOD HAS YET TO BE EMPLOYED THAT CAN SHED LIGHT ON STUDENTS’ LEARNING PROCESSES. THIS TYPE OF INQUIRY NECESSITATES QUALITATIVE METHODS, WHICH ALLOW FOR A HOLISTIC DESCRIPTION OF THE SKILLS A STUDENT USES THROUGHOUT THE COMPUTING CODE THEY PRODUCE, THE ORGANIZATION OF THESE DESCRIPTIONS INTO THEMES, AND A COMPARISON OF THE EMERGENT THEMES ACROSS STUDENTS OR ACROSS TIME.

THIS PAPER DESCRIBES AN ""ALTERNATIVE MIDTERM""EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED IN AN UNDERGRADUATE INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE CLASS. IN THIS PILOT, STUDENTS WERE ASKED TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR NEWLY LEARNED DATA SCIENCE SKILLS BY TEACHING THEM TO INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT DATA SCIENCE BACKGROUNDS. THE EVIDENCE OF LEARNING WILL BE ILLUSTRATED THROUGH AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE STUDENTS' TEACHING PRODUCTS. THESE PRODUCTS CONSIST OF TWO PARTS: (1) ""TEACHING PREPARATION""MATERIALS, SUCH AS PYTHON NOTEBOOKS CONTAINING PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS CRAFTED BY THE STUDENTS, AND (2) ""TEACHING IMPLEMENTATION"", VIDEO RECORDINGS OF REAL-TIME INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE STUDENTS AND THEIR ""TUTEES.""THE PAPER WILL ALSO PRESENT QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK FROM THE STUDENTS, HIGHLIGHTING PROMISING SIGNS OF ENGAGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE.

THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY DATA-DRIVEN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING, HAS EXPANDED CONSIDERABLY, WITH MANY APPLICATIONS AND A GROWING SOCIAL AND SCIENTIFIC DEBATE ON ETHICAL ISSUES, OPPORTUNITIES, AND RISKS. THEREFORE, THERE IS A DISCOURSE ON UPDATING EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND CONTENT AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL TO PREPARE CITIZENS FOR THEIR FUTURE LIFE IN A “DATA SOCIETY.” AN UPDATED CONCEPTION OF STATISTICAL LITERACY IMPLIES NEW EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS, WITH A VIEW TOWARD DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SCIENCES, UBIQUITY OF DATA, AND SOCIETAL AND CULTURAL IMPACTS. THE USE OF DIGITAL TOOLS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THESE NEW APPROACHES. IN THIS CHAPTER, FOUR IN-DEPTH EXAMPLES OF NEW, TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN CONTENT FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION ARE PROVIDED TO SHOW THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL RESOURCES ON GOALS AND CONTENTS OF STATISTICS EDUCATION. THESE EXAMPLES EXPLORE THE IMPACT ON DATA ANALYSIS, STATISTICAL INFERENCE, STATISTICAL MODELING, AND DATA COLLECTION. THE EXAMPLES ALSO SHOW HOW DIGITAL TOOLS CAN BE ADAPTED TO THE STUDENTS’ CAPABILITIES AND NEEDS TO SERVE A DUAL ROLE IN EDUCATION, NAMELY, SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN LEARNING AND DOING STATISTICS. © SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG 2024.","DATA COLLECTION; DATA EXPLORATIONS; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY; IMPACT OF DIGITALISATION; LEARNING DECISION TREES; MACHINE LEARNING EDUCATION; SECONDARY STUDENTS ; SIMULATION-BASED INFERENCE; STATISTICS EDUCATION","","","","","","","","ARNOLD P., STATISTICAL INVESTIGATIVE QUESTIONS – AN ENQUIRY INTO POSING AND ANSWERING INVESTIGATIVE QUESTIONS FROM EXISTING DATA, DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY, (2013); ARNOLD P., FRANKLIN C., WHAT MAKES A GOOD STATISTICAL QUESTION?, J STAT DATA SCI EDUC, 29, 1, PP. 122-130, (2021); ARNOLD P., PFANNKUCH M., WILD C., REGAN M., BUDGETT S., ENHANCING STUDENTS’ INFERENTIAL REASONING: FROM HANDS-ON TO “MOVIES”, J STAT EDUC, 19, 2, PP. 1-32, (2011); BAKKER A., GRAVEMEIJER K., LEARNING TO REASON ABOUT DISTRIBUTIONS, THE CHALLENGE OF DEVELOPING STATISTICAL LITERACY, REASONING AND THINKING, PP. 147-168, (2004); BARGAGLIOTTI A., FRANKLIN C., ARNOLD P., GOULD R., JOHNSON L., PEREZ L., SPANGLER D., PRE-K-12 GUIDELINES FOR ASSESSMENT AND INSTRUCTION IN STATISTICS EDUCATION (GAISE) REPORT II, (2020); BIEHLER R., EXPLORATIVE DATENANALYSE – EINE UNTERSUCHUNG AUS DER PERSPEKTIVE EINER DESKRIPTIV-EMPIRISCHEN WISSENSCHAFTSTHEORIE, (1982); BIEHLER R., SOFTWARE TOOLS AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION: THE CASE OF STATISTICS, PP. 68-100, (1993); BIEHLER R., SOFTWARE FOR LEARNING AND FOR DOING STATISTICS, INT STAT REV, 65, 2, PP. 167-189, (1997); BIEHLER R., SOFTWARE FOR LEARNING AND FOR DOING STATISTICS AND PROBABILITY – LOOKING BACK AND LOOKING FORWARD FROM A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE, PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL VIRTUAL CONGRESS OF STATISTICAL EDUCATION, (2019); BIEHLER R., FLEISCHER Y., INTRODUCING STUDENTS TO MACHINE LEARNING WITH DECISION TREES USING CODAP AND JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS, TEACH STAT, 43, PP.

IN TRANSLATING SCHOLARSHIP AROUND CULTURALLY RELEVANT PEDAGOGY FROM THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION WE DEVELOP THE IDEA OF CULTURALLY RELEVANT DATA. WE SEE THIS DEVELOPMENT AS A KEY INGREDIENT TO IMPLEMENTING CULTURALLY RELEVANT PEDAGOGY IN TEACHING DATA-INTENSIVE COURSES LEVERAGING THE CENTRALITY OF CONTEXT THROUGH DATA IN BOTH STATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE TO ENGAGE STUDENTS PARTICULARLY FROM HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED GROUPS IN STEM. WE PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS AS TO WAYS OF FINDING OR CREATING CULTURALLY RELEVANT DATA AND USING THEM IN IMPLEMENTING CULTURALLY RELEVANT PEDAGOGY TO SUPPORT THE LEARNING AND FLOURISHING OF STUDENTS IN STATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE COURSES.

ITS VERSATILITY ENABLES RESEARCHERS TO EXPLORE DIVERSE RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND EXTRACT VALUABLE INSIGHTS FROM DATA. THEREFORE, IT IS CRUCIAL TO EXTEND FAMILIARITY WITH CLASSIFICATION METHODS TO NON-STEM STUDENTS, WHO WILL ENCOUNTER SUCH PROBLEMS IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL CAREERS. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A DATA SCIENCE COURSE FOR NON-STEM STUDENTS ON CLASSIFICATION METHODS. THE COURSE’S DIFFICULTY LEVEL IS INFLUENCED BY FACTORS SUCH AS STUDENTS’ BACKGROUNDS AND THE PREREQUISITES AND REQUIREMENTS SET BY THE OFFERING DEPARTMENT. THE SUGGESTED COURSE FRAMEWORK BEGINS WITH DATA PREPARATION AND PROVIDES STUDENTS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE TOOLBOX COMPRISING METHODICAL TECHNIQUES AND SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR CLASSIFICATION. THIS COURSE GUIDES STUDENTS TOWARD DISCOVERING NEW KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHTS ABOUT CLASSIFICATION AND INTERPRETATION. THE TEACHING APPROACH EMPHASIZES THE DYNAMIC PROCESS INVOLVED IN CLASSIFICATION, ENCOMPASSING GRASPING THE ANALYTICAL TASK, UNDERSTANDING TERMS AND CONCEPTS, VISUALIZING THE CLASSIFICATION, ANALYZING DATA, INTERPRETING RESULTS, AND DRAWING CONCLUSIONS. THIS COURSE ALSO COMBINES PROJECT-BASED LEARNING, OPEN DISCUSSIONS, AND EVEN COMPETITIONS AMONG CLASS PARTICIPANTS. INCORPORATING PRACTICAL PROJECTS THAT INVOLVE INTERACTION AND DECISION-MAKING WITHIN A QUANTITATIVE COURSE CAN BE HIGHLY BENEFICIAL.

HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES IN DISCIPLINARY PRACTICES AND ROUTINES, AS WELL AS SCHOOL ORGANIZATION AND CULTURE, CAN POSE BARRIERS TO SUBJECT INTEGRATION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DESCRIBE SYNERGIES AND TENSIONS BETWEEN DATA SCIENCE AND THE ARTS, AND HOW THESE CAN CREATE OR CONSTRAIN OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNERS TO ENGAGE IN IIR. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE AUTHORS CO-DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED FOUR ARTS-INTEGRATED DATA LITERACY UNITS WITH 10 TEACHERS OF ARTS AND MATHEMATICS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOMS FROM FOUR DIFFERENT SCHOOLS IN THE USA. THE DATA INCLUDE STUDENT-GENERATED ARTWORK AND THEIR WRITTEN RATIONALES, AND INTERVIEWS WITH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. THROUGH MAXIMUM VARIATION SAMPLING, THE AUTHORS IDENTIFIED EXAMPLES FROM THE DATA TO ILLUSTRATE DISCIPLINARY SYNERGIES AND TENSIONS THAT APPEARED TO SUPPORT DIFFERENT IIR PROCESSES AMONG STUDENTS. FINDINGS: ASPECTS OF ARTISTIC REPRESENTATION, INCLUDING EMBODIMENT, NARRATIVE AND VISUAL IMAGE; AND ASPECTS OF THE CULTURE OF ARTS, INCLUDING AN EMPHASIS ON PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF SUBJECTIVITY AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE AUDIENCE’S PERSPECTIVE, CREATED SYNERGIES AND TENSIONS THAT BOTH OFFERED AND HINDERED OPPORTUNITIES FOR IIR (I.E. GOING BEYOND DATA, USING DATA AS EVIDENCE AND EXPRESSING UNCERTAINTY). ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY ANSWERS CALLS FOR HUMANISTIC APPROACHES TO DATA LITERACY EDUCATION. IT CONTRIBUTES AN INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE ON DATA LITERACY THAT COMPLEMENTS OTHER CONTEXT-ORIENTED PERSPECTIVES ON DATA SCIENCE. THIS STUDY ALSO OFFERS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW DESIGNERS AND EDUCATORS CAN CAPITALIZE ON SYNERGIES AND MITIGATE TENSIONS BETWEEN DOMAINS TO PROMOTE SUCCESSFUL IIR IN ARTS-INTEGRATED DATA LITERACY EDUCATION. © 2023, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.","ARTS-INTEGRATION; CLASSROOMS; CO-DESIGN; DATA LITERACY; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; INFORMAL INFERENTIAL REASONING; INTERDISCIPLINARY LEARNING; MIDDLE SCHOOL; STEAM","","","","","","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, (1908557, 1908030, 1908142)","THIS RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED BY A COLLABORATIVE DR K-12 GRANT FROM THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, AWARD NUMBERS: 1908557, 1908030 AND 1908142.","ASLAN C.E., PINSKY M.L., RYAN M.E., SOUTHER S., TERRELL K.A., CULTIVATING CREATIVITY IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE, CONSERVATION BIOLOGY, 28, 2, PP. 345-353, (2014); BACH B., STEFANER M., BOY J., DRUCKER S., BARTRAM L., WOOD J., CIUCCARELLI P., ENGELHARDT Y., KOPPEN U., TVERSKY B., NARRATIVE DESIGN PATTERNS FOR DATA-DRIVEN STORYTELLING, DATA-DRIVEN STORYTELLING, PP. 107-133, (2018); BEN-ZVI D., GIL E., APEL N., WHAT IS HIDDEN BEYOND THE DATA?

ACCORDINGLY, THE BOOK IS SUITABLE FOR TEACHERS AND LECTURERS IN ALL EDUCATIONAL FRAMEWORKS: K-12, ACADEMIA AND INDUSTRY. THIS BOOK AIMS AT CLOSING A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN THE LITERATURE ON THE PEDAGOGY OF DATA SCIENCE. WHILE THERE ARE MANY ARTICLES AND WHITE PAPERS DEALING WITH THE CURRICULUM OF DATA SCIENCE (I.E., WHAT TO TEACH?), THE PEDAGOGICAL ASPECT OF THE FIELD (I.E., HOW TO TEACH?) IS ALMOST NEGLECTED. AT THE SAME TIME, THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PEDAGOGICAL ASPECTS OF DATA SCIENCE INCREASES AS MORE AND MORE PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY OPEN TO A VARIETY OF PEOPLE. THIS BOOK PROVIDES A VARIETY OF PEDAGOGICAL DISCUSSIONS AND SPECIFIC TEACHING METHODS AND FRAMEWORKS, AS WELL AS INCLUDES EXERCISES, AND GUIDELINES RELATED TO MANY DATA SCIENCE CONCEPTS (E.G., DATA THINKING AND THE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW), MAIN MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND CONCEPTS (E.G., KNN, SVM, NEURAL NETWORKS, PERFORMANCE METRICS, CONFUSION MATRIX, AND BIASES) AND DATA SCIENCE PROFESSIONAL TOPICS (E.G., ETHICS, SKILLS AND RESEARCH APPROACH). PROFESSOR ORIT HAZZAN IS A FACULTY MEMBER AT THE TECHNION’S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SINCE OCTOBER 2000. HER RESEARCH FOCUSES ON COMPUTER SCIENCE, SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, SHE STUDIES THE COGNITIVE AND SOCIAL PROCESSES ON THE INDIVIDUAL, THE TEAM AND THE ORGANIZATION LEVELS, IN ALL KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS. DR. KOBY MIKE IS A PH.D. GRADUATE FROM THE TECHNION'S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF PROFESSOR ORIT HAZZAN. HE CONTINUED HIS POST-DOC RESEARCH ON DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AT THE BAR-ILAN UNIVERSITY, AND OBTAINED A B.SC. AND AN M.SC. IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING FROM TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY. © THE EDITOR(S) (IF APPLICABLE) AND THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG 2023.","COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION;

IT IS HELPFUL FOR THE INTEGRATION OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE INTO DATA SCIENCE, WHILE MAINTAINING ITS OWN CORE ADVANTAGES. MOREOVER, IT COULD SHOWCASE THE FEATURES OF THE SUBJECT AND ITS TALENT CULTIVATION.[ DESIGN/METHODOLOGY]THROUGH INDUCTIVE ANALYSIS, THE DISCIPLINARY CONNOTATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE AND ITS CORRELATIVITY WITH LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE WERE CONDENSED. MOREOVER, THE CURRENT STATUS AND CORE FEATURES OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IN THE FIELD OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE ALL OVER THE WORLD WERE SUMMARIZED.[FINDINGS/CONCLUSION]ALTHOUGH DATA SCIENCE AND THE SUBJECT OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE ARE TWO DISTINCT FIELDS, THERE IS AN OBVIOUS BLENDING TREND BETWEEN THEM. THE SUBJECT OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE HAS BECOME THE BACKBONE FORCE OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION WORLDWIDE. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE, ""HUMAN-CENTERED"" IS THE CORE FEATURE OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, WHICHCOULD LAY A FOUNDATION FOR MAKING DATA SCIENCE TALENTS FAMILIAR WITH INNOVATIVE TECHNICAL METHODS AND MINDED WITH GREAT HUMANISTIC CARE.[ORIGINALITY/VALUE]THE CORE FEATURES AND SUPERIORITY OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION ARE SYSTEMATICALLY SUMMARIZED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A REFERENCE FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE TO KEEP ITS OWN STRENGTHS, PERFECT THE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION SYSTEM, AND IMPROVE TALENT CULTIVATING EFFECTIVENESS IN THE INTEGRATION OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE INTO DATA SCIENCE. © 2023 CHINESE JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY.","DATA SCIENCE; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; DISCIPLINARY CROSS-FERTILIZATION AND INTEGRATION; DISCIPLINARY PROSPECT; HUMAN-CENTERED; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE; TALENT CULTIVATION","","","","","","","","OPINIONS OF THE STATE COUNCIL OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA ON BUILDING A MORE PERFECT INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM FOR MARKET-BASED ALLOCATION OF FACTORS; BIG DATA INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT PLAN (2016-2020); SONG I, ZHU Y J., BIG DATA AND DATA SCIENCE: WHAT SHOULD WE TEACH?

IN RESPONSE TO THE SITUATION REQUIRED OF THE APPROVED PROGRAM FOR MATHEMATICS, DATA SCIENCE, AND AI SMART HIGHER EDUCATION (MDASH), WE PROPOSED A CONCEPTUAL CURRICULUM MODEL FOR THE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION PROGRAM, WHICH SYSTEMATICALLY INCORPORATES THE KNOWLEDGE MODULE OF DATA SCIENCE WHILE REMEDYING THE WEAKNESS IN THE BASIC MATH SKILLS AND BARRIERS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING DATA SCIENCE CONCEPTS. THIS PAPER AIMS TO PROPOSE AN INTEGRATED CURRICULUM BASED ON THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR THE FACULTY MEMBERS IN A SMALL-SIZED PRIVATE LIBERAL ARTS UNIVERSITY, WHERE STUDENTS LACK BASIC MATH SKILLS, IT SKILLS, AND THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF DATA SCIENCE.

THE FRAMEWORK IS ORGANIZED AROUND THREE KEY DIMENSIONS INVOLVING ENGAGEMENT & ACTION, KNOWLEDGE, AND ENABLING PROCESSES. IT IDENTIFIES KNOWLEDGE-BASES COVERING MEANING FOR SOCIETY AND POLICY AND CRITICAL EVALUATION AND REFLECTION; SELECTED STATISTICAL AND MATHEMATICAL CONSTRUCTS AND SKILLS; CORE LITERACY AND MATHEMATICAL SKILLS; UNDERSTANDING MODELS AND MODELLING, MULTIVARIATE IDEAS AND TEXTUAL AND RICH VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS; KNOWLEDGE OF RESEARCH AND DATA PRODUCTION METHODS AND EXTENSIONS RELATED TO OFFICIAL STATISTICS AND RISK ON THE SOCIETAL LEVEL; AND IT EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF APPROPRIATE DISPOSITIONS, CRITICAL STANCE, AND HABITS OF MIND. WE OFFER EXAMPLES AND CURRICULUM TASKS THAT ILLUSTRATE EACH OF THE 11 FACETS AND THEIR INTERCONNECTEDNESS. WE ALSO DESCRIBE THE USE OF A ‘RADAR PLOT’ TOOL TO SUPPORT THE ANALYSIS OF HOW BALANCED ARE PROSPECTIVE CLASS ACTIVITIES OR TEST ITEMS IN TERMS OF COVERING THE 11 FACETS AND TOOLS.

FOR THIS PURPOSE, THIS STUDY PROPOSED AND CONDUCTED THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM USING EPISTEMIC NETWORK ANALYSIS (ENA) AND ANALYZED STUDENTS’ REPORTS. THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS WERE (1) WHAT DO NOVICES LEARN IN INTRODUCTORY QE EDUCATION? AND (2) HOW DO STUDENTS LEARN IN THE PROPOSED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM? RECENTLY, EDUCATION FOR DATA SCIENCE AND DATA LITERACY HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN MANY COUNTRIES BECAUSE DATA SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS HAVE BECOME ESSENTIAL IN THE 21ST CENTURY. IT IS REQUIRED TO DEVELOP THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM IN LITERACY LEVEL AS WELL AS GROWING DATA SCIENTISTS. MOREOVER, TEACHING QE HAS BECOME A HIGH-PROFILE TOPIC IN THE QE COMMUNITY. CONSEQUENTLY, I EXAMINED THE POTENTIAL OF AN EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM IN WHICH NOVICES ANALYZE DATA BY ENA. AS A RESULT, THE STUDENTS UNDERSTOOD THE OPERATION AND USEFULNESS OF ENA THROUGH THE COURSE. BESIDES, THEY ENJOYED INTERPRETING THE DATA WITH DIVERSE TEAM MEMBERS. THIS STUDY DISCUSSES THE COURSE DESIGN AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AS THE FIRST STEP TO QE DEMOCRATIZATION. © 2023, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG.","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; EPISTEMIC NETWORK ANALYSIS; HIGHER EDUCATION; TEACHING QUANTITATIVE ETHNOGRAPHY","CURRICULA; STUDENTS; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; EDUCATION PROGRAMMES; EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM; EPISTEMIC NETWORK ANALYSE; EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATIONS; HIGH EDUCATIONS; LEARN+; RESEARCH QUESTIONS; SCIENCE EDUCATION; TEACHING QUANTITATIVE ETHNOGRAPHY; DATA SCIENCE","","","","","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, (DRL-1661036, DRL-1713110, DRL-2100320); NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF; WISCONSIN ALUMNI RESEARCH FOUNDATION, WARF; OFFICE OF THE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR RESEARCH AND GRADUATE EDUCATION, UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON, VCRGE, UW; JAPAN SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCE, JSPS, (JP 23K11357, JP18K13238, JP19H01715, JP20K03066, JP22H01043); JAPAN SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCE, JSPS","ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

THE PRESENT CHAPTER EXAMINES ISSUES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PROMOTING NECESSARY CHANGES IN THE TEACHING AND LEARNING OF CIVIC STATISTICS, WHICH ARE NEEDED FOR EMPOWERING CITIZENS TO ENGAGE WITH AND ANALYZE DATA SOURCES AND DATA-INFORMED REASONING ABOUT BURNING ISSUES IN SOCIETY, AND CRITICALLY INTERPRET MESSAGES RELATED TO CIVIC STATISTICS ENCOUNTERED IN THE NEWS MEDIA, SOCIAL NETWORKS AND RELATED DIGITAL SOURCES. THE CHAPTER FIRST PROVIDES FURTHER ILLUSTRATIONS OF ACTIVITIES OR TASKS PERTAINING TO CIVIC STATISTICS AND SHOWS HOW TO ANALYSE TASK DEMANDS IN TERMS OF THE FACETS AND TOOLS THEY REQUIRE. THEN, GENERAL QUESTIONS ARE EXAMINED REGARDING THE ALL-IMPORTANT ALIGNMENT OF THE FEATURES OF CIVIC STATISTICS AND THEIR DEMANDS WITH CURRICULUM PLANS AND LEARNING GOALS, CLASSROOM TEACHING PRACTICES, AND ASSESSMENT METHODS. WE PROVIDE SOME GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING ASSESSMENT ITEMS RELEVANT TO CIVIC STATISTICS. FINALLY, THE CHAPTER PRESENTS SIX BROAD RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO CHANGES IN SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT CAN PROMOTE ATTENTION TO AND CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING OF CIVIC STATISTICS, AT THE SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY LEVELS, AND WHICH CAN IMPROVE EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION AND ASSESSMENT IN THIS REGARD, WITHIN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION, STATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, AND RELATED DISCIPLINES. © SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERL AND AG 2022.","CURRICULUM ALIGNMENT; DATA LITERACY; MEDIA LITERACY; STATISTICAL LITERACY; STATISTICS EDUCATION","","","","","","","","BARGAGLIOTTI A., FRANKLIN C., ARNOLD P., GOULD R., JOHNSON S., PEREZ L., SPANGLER D., PRE-K-12 GUIDELINES FOR ASSESSMENT AND INSTRUCTION IN STATISTICS EDUCATION (GAISE) REPORT II, AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION AND NATIONAL COUNCIL OF TEACHERS OF MATHEMATICS, (2020); GUIDELINES FOR ASSESSMENT AND INSTRUCTION IN STATISTICS EDUCATION: COLLEGE REPORT, AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION, (2016); GAL I., OGRAJENSEK I., OFFICIAL STATISTICS AND STATISTICS EDUCATION: BRIDGING THE GAP, JOURNAL OF OFFICIAL STATISTICS, 33, 1, PP. 79-100, (2017); ENGAGING CIVIC STATISTICS: A CALL FOR ACTION AND RECOMMENDATIONS, A PRODUCT OF THE PROCIVICSTAT PROJECT, (2018); RIDGWAY J., IMPLICATIONS OF THE DATA REVOLUTION FOR STATISTICS EDUCATION, INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW, 84, 3, PP. 528-549, (2016); RIDGWAY J., NICHOLSON J., GAL I., TASK ANALYSIS TOOL: FACETS OF STATISTICAL LITERACY, PREPARED FOR A PROCIVICSTAT WORKSHOP AT THE IASE SATELLITE CONFERENCE, (2017); MAKING DATA MEANINGFUL: A GUIDE TO IMPROVING STATISTICAL LITERACY, UNITED NATIONS ECONOMIC COMMISSION FOR EUROPE, (2012)","I.

INITIAL WORK IN A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL SETTING SUGGESTS THAT EXPLICITLY DESIGNING FOR EXPERIENCES OF FAILURE LEADS TO BETTER LEARNING OUTCOMES THAN DESIGNING FOR SUCCESS. WE BUILD ON THIS TO REPORT ON A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WHERE STUDENTS ARE EXPOSED TO FAILURE-DRIVEN, SUCCESS-DRIVEN, OR NO EXPLICIT SCAFFOLDING IN PROBLEM-SOLVING PRIOR TO INSTRUCTION. FOR ASSESSMENTS OF NON-ISOMORPHIC CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING, OUR RESULTS ALIGN WITH THOSE FROM PRIOR WORK. DESPITE THE SIMILARITY IN POSTTEST SCORES, STUDENTS EXPOSED TO FAILURE-DRIVEN SCAFFOLDING DEMONSTRATE HIGHER QUALITY OF CONSTRUCTIVE REASONING THAN THOSE RECEIVING SUCCESS-DRIVEN SCAFFOLDING. ADDITIONALLY, OUR STUDY REVEALS LEARNING BENEFITS OF FAILURE-DRIVEN SCAFFOLDING (FOR BOTH POSTTEST SCORES AND REASONING QUALITY) ON ASSESSMENTS OF TRANSFER.

WHAT DOES THE END-TO-END WORKFLOW OF A DATA SCIENTIST'S COLLABORATION WITH CLIENTS LOOK LIKE THROUGHOUT THE LIFETIME OF A PROJECT? TO INVESTIGATE THIS QUESTION, WE INTERVIEWED TEN DATA SCIENTISTS (5 FEMALE, 4 MALE, 1 NON-BINARY) IN DIVERSE ROLES ACROSS INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIA. WE DISCOVERED THAT THEY WORK WITH CLIENTS IN A SIX-STAGE OUTER-LOOP WORKFLOW, WHICH INVOLVES 1) LAYING GROUNDWORK BY BUILDING TRUST BEFORE A PROJECT BEGINS, 2) ORIENTING TO THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE CLIENT'S ENVIRONMENT, 3) COLLABORATIVELY FRAMING THE PROBLEM, 4) BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN DATA SCIENCE AND DOMAIN EXPERTISE, 5) THE INNER LOOP OF TECHNICAL DATA ANALYSIS WORK, 6) COUNSELING TO HELP CLIENTS EMOTIONALLY COPE WITH ANALYSIS RESULTS. THIS NOVEL OUTER-LOOP WORKFLOW CONTRIBUTES TO CSCW BY EXPANDING THE NOTION OF WHAT COLLABORATION MEANS IN DATA SCIENCE BEYOND THE WIDELY-KNOWN INNER-LOOP TECHNICAL WORKFLOW STAGES OF ACQUIRING, CLEANING, ANALYZING, MODELING, AND VISUALIZING DATA.

HOWEVER, MANY ITS RELY HEAVILY ON EXPERT DESIGN AND HAND-CRAFTED RULES. THIS MAKES THEM DIFFICULT TO BUILD AND TRANSFER ACROSS DOMAINS AND LIMITS THEIR POTENTIAL EFFICACY. IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATE HOW FEEDBACK IN A LARGE-SCALE ITS CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED IN A DATA-DRIVEN WAY, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY HOW PERSONALIZATION OF FEEDBACK CAN LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN STUDENT PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES. FIRST, IN THIS PAPER WE PROPOSE A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO GENERATE PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK IN AN AUTOMATED WAY, WHICH TAKES INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF STUDENTS INTO ACCOUNT, WHILE ALLEVIATING THE NEED OF EXPERT INTERVENTION AND DESIGN OF HAND-CRAFTED RULES. WE LEVERAGE STATE-OF-THE-ART MACHINE LEARNING AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK USING HINTS AND WIKIPEDIA-BASED EXPLANATIONS. SECOND, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK LEADS TO IMPROVED SUCCESS RATES AT SOLVING EXERCISES IN PRACTICE: OUR PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK MODEL IS USED IN KORBIT, A LARGE-SCALE DIALOGUE-BASED ITS WITH AROUND 20,000 STUDENTS LAUNCHED IN 2019. WE PRESENT THE RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS WITH STUDENTS AND SHOW THAT THE AUTOMATED, DATA-DRIVEN, PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANT OVERALL IMPROVEMENT OF 22.95% IN STUDENT PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES AND SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SUBJECTIVE EVALUATION OF THE FEEDBACK. © 2021, THE AUTHOR(S).","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION;

THE LECTURES ON THESE TOPICS CANNOT STAND ALONE WITHOUT CODING PRACTICE ON REAL-WORLD DATA SETS. SOME INSTRUCTORS PREFER TO UTILIZE SMALL DATA SETS FOR PRACTICE IN CLASSROOM OR ASSIGNMENTS, WHICH LIMITS EXPERIMENTAL EXPERIENCES AND MAY EVEN BRING MISLEADING EXPERIENCES TO STUDENTS. OTHERS MAY TRY TO ASSIGN LARGE DATA SETS TO STUDENTS, BUT STUDENTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BEAR WITH THE RUNNING TIME DUE TO THE EFFICIENCY ISSUE RAISED BY SEVERAL FACTORS (E.G., DATA SIZE, ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY, COMPUTING POWER, ETC.). IN THIS PAPER, WE FIRST LEARNED STUDENTS' PREFERENCES ON THE SCALABILITY OF DATA SETS FOR PRACTICE IN DATA SCIENCE COURSES, AND PERFORMED EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS BY RUNNING DIFFERENT DATA SCIENCE ALGORITHMS OVER BOTH STUDENT LAPTOPS AND PERSONAL/OFFICE COMPUTERS, IN ORDER TO DELIVER A SUGGESTION ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE DATA SIZE FOR PRACTICE IN MULTIPLE SCENARIOS (E.G., IN-CLASS PRACTICE, ASSIGNMENTS, CLASS PROJECTS, RESEARCH PROJECTS, ETC.).

HOWEVER, IT REMAINS UNCERTAIN WHETHER THE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS PROVIDED BY UNIVERSITIES WITH DIFFERENT RANKINGS DELIVER SIMILAR OR DISTINCT DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES. THIS STUDY AIMS TO COMPARE THE COMPETENCIES OF GRADUATE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS OFFERED IN THE UNITED STATES. IT ADDRESSED THE RESEARCH QUESTION OF 'ARE THERE ANY DIFFERENCES IN GRADUATE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAM COMPETENCIES BASED ON THEIR UNIVERSITY RANKINGS?' THE PROGRAM COMPETENCIES OF 228 DATA SCIENCE GRADUATE PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THEIR U.S. NEWS UNIVERSITY RANKINGS WERE COLLECTED AND COMPARED. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT REGARDLESS OF THEIR NATIONAL RANKINGS, ALL UNIVERSITIES OFFER MOST OF THE COMPETENCIES REQUIRED FOR DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS, EXCEPT FOR MACHINE LEARNING AND SENSOR NETWORKS. FORTY-SIX PERCENT OF DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED IN UNIVERSITIES THAT HOLD NATIONAL RANKINGS WITHIN THE TOP 75, FOCUSING ON MAJORS SUCH AS DATA SCIENCE AND BUSINESS ANALYTICS. FURTHERMORE, THE TOP-RANKED UNIVERSITIES PROVIDE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL DEPARTMENTS OR SCHOOLS, WITH THE MOST PROMINENT ONES BEING BUSINESS, COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, AND MATH/STATISTICS. THE PRIMARY RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION OF THIS STUDY REVOLVES AROUND CONDUCTING A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF DATA SCIENCE PROGRAM COMPETENCIES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS HAVE SIGNIFICANT RELEVANCE TO COMPUTING EDUCATION. THE STUDY PROVIDES VALUABLE GUIDELINES FOR EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES IN THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE: 1) NAMING THE NEW MAJORS AS EITHER 'DATA SCIENCE' OR 'BUSINESS ANALYTICS'; 2) HOUSING THE NEW DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS WITHIN EXISTING DEPARTMENTS OR SCHOOLS SPECIALIZING IN BUSINESS, COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, AND MATH/STATISTICS; 3) INCORPORATING ALL ACM DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES INTO THE CURRICULUM OF THESE PROGRAMS WHILE ALSO EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR A STRONG FOUNDATION IN MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS. OVERALL, THESE IMPLICATIONS PROVIDE VALUABLE GUIDANCE FOR UNIVERSITIES SEEKING TO DEVELOP IMPACTFUL AND WELL-ROUNDED DATA SCIENCE EDUCATIONAL OFFERINGS THAT ALIGN WITH INDUSTRY DEMANDS AND EQUIP STUDENTS WITH THE NECESSARY SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE. © 2023 IEEE.","ACM COMPETENCIES; COMPUTER SCIENCE; COMPUTING EDUCATION; DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCE; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; GRADUATE EDUCATION","EDUCATION COMPUTING; ENGINEERING EDUCATION; STUDENTS; ACM COMPETENCY; BUSINESS ANALYTICS; COMPUTING EDUCATION; DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCE; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; GRADUATE EDUCATION; GRADUATE PROGRAMME; SCIENCE EDUCATION; SCIENCE PROJECTS; SCIENCE TECHNOLOGIES; SENSOR NETWORKS","","","","","","","PAUL P., AITHAL P.S., COMPUTING ACADEMICS INTO NEW AGEPROGRAMS AND FIELDS: BIG DATA ANALYTICS & DATA SCIENCES IN INDIANACADEMICS-AN ACADEMIC INVESTIGATION, IRA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNALOF MANAGEMENT & SOCIAL SCIENCES, 10, PP. 107-118, (2018); ZHANG Y., WU D., HAGEN L., SONG I.Y., MOSTAFA J., OH S., ANDERSON T., DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM IN THE IFIELD, JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, (2022); SONG I.Y., ZHU Y., BIG DATA AND DATA SCIENCE: OPPORTUNITIES ANDCHALLENGES OF ISCHOOLS, JOURNAL OF DATA AND INFORMATION SCIENCE, 2, PP. 1-18, (2016); WHITE J.A., GAVER D.P., BUTERA R.J., ET AL., CORE COMPETENCIES FORUNDERGRADUATES IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING: FINDINGS, CONSEQUENCES, AND RECOMMENDATIONS, ANN BIOMED ENGVOL., 48, PP. 905-912, (2020); BUKHARI D., DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM: CURRENT SCENARIO, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA MINING & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENTPROCESS (IJDKP), 10, (2020); LI D., MILONAS E., ZHANG Q., CONTENT ANALYSIS OF DATA SCIENCE GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN THE US, 2021 ASEE VIRTUAL ANNUAL CONFERENCE CONTENT ACCESS, (2021); OVERTON M., KELEINSCHMIT S., DATA SCIENCE LITERACY: TOWARD APHILOSOPHY OF ACCESSIBLE AND ADAPTABLE DATA SCIENCE SKILL DEVELOPMENTIN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION PROGRAMS, TEACHING PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, 40, 3, PP. 354-365, (2022); DEMCHENKO Y., BELLOUM A., LOS W., WIKTORSKI T., MANIERI A., BROCKS H., BECKER J., HEUTELBECK D., HEMMJE M., BREWER S., EDISON DATA SCIENCE FRAMEWORK: A FOUNDATION FOR BUILDING DATA SCIENCE PROFESSION FOR RESEARCH AND INDUSTRY, PP. 620-626, (2016); LEIDIG P., CASSEL L., ACM TASKFORCE EFFORTS ON COMPUTINGCOMPETENCIES IN UNDERGRADUATE DATA SCIENCE CURRICULA, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 ACM CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, (2020); DE VEAUX R., AGARWAL M., AVERETT M., BAUMER B., BRAY A., BRESSOUD T., BRYANT L., CHENG L., FRANCIS A., GOULD R., KIM A., KRETCHMAR M., LU Q., MOSKOL A., NOLAN D., PELAYO R., RALEIGH S., SETHI R., SONDJAJA M., TIRUVILUAMALA N., UHLIG P., WASHINGTON T., WESLEY C., WHITE D., YE P., CURRICULUM GUIDELINES FORUNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS IN DATA SCIENCE, THE ANNUAL REVIEW OFSTATISTICS AND ITS APPLICATION, (2017)","","","INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC.","AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR ENGINEERING EDUCATION (ASEE)/EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND METHODS DIVISON (ERM); IEEE; IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY; IEEE EDUCATION SOCIETY","53RD IEEE ASEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE, FIE 2023","18 OCTOBER 2023 THROUGH 21 OCTOBER 2023","COLLEGE STATION","196211","15394565","979-835033642-9","PFECD","","ENGLISH","PROC.

EFFECTIVE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION REQUIRES A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THAT INCORPORATES THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE, PRACTICAL SKILLS, AND INDUSTRY RELEVANCE. HOWEVER, IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND APPROPRIATE TEACHING STRATEGIES AND TOOLS THAT SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ALL THESE ELEMENTS INTO THE CLASSROOM. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS A NEED TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP EFFECTIVE PEDAGOGICAL METHODS, INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES, AND TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE INSTRUCTORS TO DELIVER WELL-ROUNDED DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION THAT CATERS TO THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND PREPARES THEM FOR REAL-WORLD DATA-DRIVEN CHALLENGES. KNOWING WHICH TECHNOLOGY IS APPROPRIATE TO USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A PARTICULAR TEACHING PEDAGOGY TO DELIVER A PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEARNING MATERIAL TO DIVERSE STUDENTS IS CRUCIAL. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE HOW THE TPACK (TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE) INFLUENCES DATA SCIENCE TEACHING PRACTICES. TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE STUDY SURVEYED 26 DATA SCIENCE INSTRUCTORS TO ASSESS THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THE SEVEN TPACK CONSTRUCTS. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY SHOWED A LOW REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. THE FINDINGS ALSO SHOWED A BALANCED KNOWLEDGE BETWEEN PEDAGOGY AND TECHNOLOGICAL CONTENT, INDICATING THAT INSTRUCTORS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A COMPREHENSIVE AND ENGAGING LEARNING ENVIRONMENT THAT SUPPORTS STUDENT SUCCESS IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. DESPITE THIS POSITIVE FINDING BEING ESTABLISHED, IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHICH TECHNOLOGICAL TEACHING AND LEARNING TOOLS INSTRUCTORS ARE FAMILIAR WITH. TO THIS END, FUTURE STUDIES ARE RECOMMENDED IN THIS AREA. THE RESULTS FURTHER SHOWED THAT MODEL EVALUATION IS NOT TAUGHT AT UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL. THEREFORE, THE STUDY RECOMMENDS CONTINUOUS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR DATA SCIENCE INSTRUCTORS TO EFFECTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS TRAINING CURRENT AND FUTURE DATA SCIENTISTS. THIS IS NECESSARY SINCE TECHNOLOGIES, DATA, AND DATA SCIENCE TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES EVOLVE. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY RECOMMENDS RESEARCH BE CONDUCTED ON THE TYPE OF DATA SCIENCE FRAMEWORK REQUIRED TO GUIDE INSTRUCTORS IN TERMS OF CURRICULUM DESIGN, PEDAGOGIES, AND TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS. RESEARCH THAT INFORMS POLICY IS ALSO NECESSARY TO SUPPORT EFFORTS DIRECTED AT DATA LITERACY, ESPECIALLY TO SUPPORT PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN HUMAN CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT IN DATA SCIENCE. LASTLY, WITHIN THE SCOPE OF DATA SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS IS RECOMMENDED SO THAT INSTRUCTORS CAN STAY UPDATED WITH ADVANCEMENTS IN SUBJECT MATTER, TECHNOLOGY, AND PEDAGOGY. © 2023 THE AUTHORS","DATA SCIENCE; EDUCATION; EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY; TEACHING; TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE","","","","","","","","AMBUSAIDI A.K., AL-MAQBALI F.Y., EXPLORING PEDAGOGICAL DECISION MAKING FROM THE LENS OF SCIENCE TEACHERS IN RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT PEDAGOGICAL ISSUES, SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES OPEN, 5, 1, (2022); ANDERSON P.E., TURNER C., DIERKSHEIDE J., MCCAULEY R., AN EXTENSIBLE ONLINE ENVIRONMENT FOR TEACHING DATA SCIENCE CONCEPTS THROUGH GAMIFICATION, PROCEEDINGS - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE, FIE, (2015); ASAMOAH D.A., DORAN D., SCHILLER S., INTERDISCIPLINARITY IN DATA SCIENCE PEDAGOGY: A FOUNDATIONAL DESIGN, JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS, 60, 4, PP. 370-377, (2020); BASARAN B., INVESTIGATING SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS TEACHER CANDIDATE'S PERCEPTIONS OF TPACK-21 BASED ON 21ST CENTURY SKILLS, ELEMENTARY EDUCATION ONLINE, 19, 4, PP. 2212-2226, (2020); BECKMAN M.D., CETINKAYA-RUNDEL M., HORTON N.J., RUNDEL C.W., SULLIVAN A.J., TACKETT M., IMPLEMENTING VERSION CONTROL WITH GIT AND GITHUB AS A LEARNING OBJECTIVE IN STATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE COURSES, JOURNAL OF STATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, 29, 1, PP. 132-144, (2021); INVESTING IN AMERICA'S DATA SCIENCE AND ANALYTICS TALENT (ISSUE APRIL), (2017); BLAKE A., DYNAMICS OF DATA SCIENCE SKILLS: HOW CAN ALL SECTORS BENEFIT FROM DATA SCIENCE TALENT?, (2019); CHANG C.-L., MCALEER M., WONG W.-K., BIG DATA, COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE, ECONOMICS, FINANCE, MARKETING, MANAGEMENT, AND PSYCHOLOGY : CONNECTIONS, JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REVIEW, 11, 15, (2018); DANIEL B.K., BIG DATA AND DATA SCIENCE: A CRITICAL REVIEW OF ISSUES FOR EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH, BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, 50, 1, PP. 101-113, (2019); DAVENPORT T., MALONE K., DEPLOYMENT AS A CRITICAL BUSINESS DATA SCIENCE DISCIPLINE, HARVARD DATA SCIENCE REVIEW, 3, 1, (2021); DILL-MCFARLAND K.A., KONIG S.G., MAZEL F., OLIVER D.C., MCEWEN L.M., HONG K.Y., HALLAM S.J., AN INTEGRATED, MODULAR APPROACH TO DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IN MICROBIOLOGY, PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY, 17, 2, (2021); DONOGHUE T., VOYTEK B., ELLIS S.E., TEACHING CREATIVE AND PRACTICAL DATA SCIENCE AT SCALE, TAYLOR & FRANCIS, 29, S1, PP. 27-39, (2021); DOUKAKIS S., PAPALASKARI M.A., SCAFFOLDING TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (TPACK) IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION THROUGH LEARNING ACTIVITY CREATION. 2019 4TH SOUTH-EAST EUROPE DESIGN AUTOMATION, COMPUTER ENGINEERING, COMPUTER NETWORKS AND SOCIAL MEDIA CONFERENCE, (2019); DOUKAKIS S., PSALTIDOU A., STAVRAKI A., ADAMOPOULOS N., TSIOTAKIS P., STERGOU S., MEASURING THE TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (TPACK) OF IN-SERVICE TEACHERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE WHO TEACH ALGORITHMS AND PROGRAMMING IN UPPER SECONDARY EDUCATION, (2021); DUBEY R., GUNASEKARAN A., EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR SUCCESSFUL CAREER IN BIG DATA AND BUSINESS ANALYTICS, INDUSTRIAL & COMMERCIAL TRAINING, 47, 4, PP. 174-181, (2015); VAN DUSEN E., SUEN A., LIANG A., BHATNAGAR A., ACCELERATING THE ADVANCEMENT OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, 56, 1, PP. 601-603, (2019); ELAS N.I.B., MAJID F.B.A., NARASUMAN S.A., DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (TPACK) FOR ENGLISH TEACHERS: THE VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING, 14, 20, PP. 18-33, (2019); ERTMER P.A., OTTENBREIT-LEFTWICH A., REMOVING OBSTACLES TO THE PEDAGOGICAL CHANGES REQUIRED BY JONASSEN'S VISION OF AUTHENTIC TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED LEARNING, COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION, 64, PP. 175-182, (2013); ERTMER P.A., OTTENBREIT-LEFTWICH A.T., SADIK O., SENDURUR E., SENDURUR P., TEACHER BELIEFS AND TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION PRACTICES: A CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP, COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION, 59, 2, PP. 423-435, (2012); GARCIA-ALGARRA J., INTRODUCTORY MACHINE LEARNING FOR NON STEM STUDENTS, (2020); GARMIRE L.X., GLISKE S., NGUYEN Q.C., CHEN J.H., NEMATI S., VAN HORN J.D., MOORE J.H., SHREFFLER C., DUNN M., THE TRAINING OF NEXT GENERATION DATA SCIENTISTS IN BIOMEDICINE.

TO DATE, THE RESEARCH ON THE IDS COURSE HAS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON PEDAGOGY, PROFESSIONAL LEARNING FOR TEACHERS, AND THE CURRICULUM. THIS MIXED-METHODS CASE STUDY EXPANDS OUR UNDERSTANDING BY ANALYZING THE PERSPECTIVE OF IDS STUDENTS AT A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL. SELFDETERMINATION THEORY PROVIDES A USEFUL FRAME FOR INTERPRETING HOW THESE STUDENTS EXPERIENCE THE IDS COURSE. THE THEORY FOCUSES ON CONDITIONS FOR STUDENTS TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL LEARNING: COMPETENCE (SELF-EFFICACY), AUTONOMY (AGENCY), AND RELATEDNESS (A SENSE OF BELONGING). THE FINDINGS FROM THIS CASE STUDY SUGGEST THE IDS STUDENTS FEEL CONFIDENT, EMPOWERED, AND PART OF A VIBRANT COMMUNITY, UNLIKE PREVIOUS MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS COURSES THEY MAY HAVE COMPLETED; AND USE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THEIR JOY IN PROBLEM-SOLVING AND THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE COURSE.

GIVEN THAT DS IS HIGHLY INTERDISCIPLINARY AND INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE VARIOUS ACADEMIC STRUCTURES, CREATING A NEW DS PROGRAM NEEDS TO CONSIDER MANY FACTORS. THIS POSTER DETAILS THE PROCESS OF HOW TO CREATE AN UNDERGRADUATE DS MINOR PROGRAM WITH CONSIDERATIONS OF THE FOLLOWING KEY QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT IS THE GENERAL BACKGROUND OF DS EDUCATION LANDSCAPE AND ISCHOOLS? (2) WHAT IS THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT OF DS EDUCATION, I.E., WHAT ARE GAPS IN THE INSTITUTIONAL DS EDUCATION? HOW DOES THE PROPOSED PROGRAM FIT IN AND DISTINGUISH ITSELF FROM OTHER DS PROGRAMS ON CAMPUS? (3) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE DS APPROVAL PROCESS WITH MULTIPLE DS PROGRAMS ON CAMPUS? THIS WORK WILL HELP THOSE WHO PLAN TO CREATE AND REVISE A DS PROGRAM THAT BENEFITS STUDENTS AND FITS IN THE BROAD DS EDUCATION LANDSCAPE AND THEIR OWN INSTITUTION.

DATA SCIENCE IS ONE OF THE SIX SCIENTIFIC GAPS THAT EMERGED IN THE GLOBAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSES (MOOCS) CAN POTENTIALLY ADDRESS THE CRITICAL NEED TO BUILD PUBLIC HEALTH DATA SCIENCE CAPABILITIES AND COMPETENCIES IN OUTBREAK AND PANDEMIC MANAGEMENT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO PERFORM A SCOPING REVIEW WITH THEMATIC ANALYSIS AND IDENTIFY THE KEY THEMES ACROSS MOOCS COVERING CONTENT ON OUTBREAK AND PANDEMIC MANAGEMENT USING QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS. A TOTAL OF 458 UNIQUE RECORDS WERE FOUND, OF WHICH 69 WERE RELEVANT TO THE PANDEMIC AND OUTBREAK MANAGEMENT CONTEXT. THEMATIC ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THREE CROSS-CUTTING THEMES: (I) PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCIES, (II) INSTITUTIONAL AND ORGANISATIONAL RESPONSE, AND (III) COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION—THE GROWING ROLE OF MOOCS IN BUILDING COMPETENCIES THAT ARE EMPOWERING AND ENABLING TO INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES. A LIMITED NUMBER OF COURSES COVERED THE USE OF DATA SCIENCE IN OUTBREAK AND PANDEMIC MANAGEMENT SUGGESTING THE NEED FOR FUTURE MOOCS TO INTEGRATE DATA SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE AND METHODS IN PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION AND TRAINING. DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES ARE CENTRAL TO STRENGTHENING THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND EFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE.

IN INVOKING EXPONENTIAL GROWTH, MATHEMATICAL MODELLING, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, AND THE LIKE, THESE DATA VISUALIZATIONS INVITE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MATHEMATICS TEACHING AND LEARNING. YET DATA VISUALIZATIONS ARE SOCIAL TEXTS, AUTHORED FROM SPECIFIC POINTS OF VIEW, THAT NARRATE PARTICULAR, AND OFTEN CONSEQUENTIAL, STORIES. THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RELIANCE ON QUANTIFICATION AND MATHEMATICS CEMENTS THEIR SOCIAL POSITIONING AS SUPPOSEDLY OBJECTIVE, RELIABLE, AND NEUTRAL. THE READING OF ANY DATA VISUALIZATION DEMANDS UNPACKING THE ROLE OF MATHEMATICS, INCLUDING HOW DATA AND VARIABLES HAVE BEEN FORMATTED AND HOW RELATIONSHIPS ARE FRAMED TO NARRATE STORIES FROM PARTICULAR POINTS OF VIEW. WE PRESENT AN APPROACH TO A CRITICAL READING OF DATA VISUALIZATIONS FOR THE CONTEXT OF MATHEMATICS EDUCATION THAT DRAWS ON THREE INTERRELATED CONCEPTS: MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING (WHAT GETS QUANTIFIED, MEASURED, AND HOW), FRAMING (HOW VARIABLES ARE RELATED AND THROUGH WHAT KIND OF DATA VISUALIZATION), AND NARRATING (WHICH STORIES THE DATA VISUALIZATION TELLS, ITS POTENTIAL IMPACTS AND LIMITS). THIS APPROACH TO READING DATA VISUALISATIONS INCLUDES A PROCESS OF REIMAGINING THROUGH REFORMATTING, REFRAMING AND RENARRATING. WE ILLUSTRATE THIS APPROACH AND THESE THREE CONCEPTS USING DATA VISUALIZATIONS PUBLISHED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES IN 2020 ABOUT COVID-19. WE OFFER A SET OF POSSIBLE QUESTIONS TO GUIDE A CRITICAL READING OF DATA VISUALIZATIONS, BEYOND THIS SET OF EXAMPLES. © 2021, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO SPRINGER NATURE B.V.","COVID-19; CRITICAL MATHEMATICS EDUCATION; CRITICAL PEDAGOGY; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; DATA VISUALIZATIONS; GRAPH READING","","","","","","","","ADAM D., A GUIDE TO R – THE PANDEMIC’S MISUNDERSTOOD METRIC, NATURE., (2020); AINLEY J., RE-VIEWING GRAPHING: TRADITIONAL AND INTUITIVE APPROACHES, FOR THE LEARNING OF MATHEMATICS, 15, 2, PP. 10-16, (1995); BAICKER K., DUBE O., MULLAINATHAN S., POPE D., WEZEREK G., IS IT SAFER TO VISIT A COFFEE SHOP OR A GYM?, THE NEW YORK TIMES., (2020); BELL A., JANVIER C., THE INTERPRETATION OF GRAPHS REPRESENTING SITUATIONS, FOR THE LEARNING OF MATHEMATICS, 2, 1, PP. 34-42, (1981); JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS’ CONSTRUCTION OF GLOBAL VIEWS OF DATA AND DATA REPRESENTATIONS, EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS, 45, PP. 35-65, (2001); DATA VISUALIZATION LITERACY: DEFINITIONS, CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS, EXERCISES, AND ASSESSMENTS, PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 116, 6, PP. 1857-1864, (2019); BOYD D., CRAWFORD K., CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR BIG DATA, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY, 15, 5, PP. 662-679, (2012); BRUNER J., THE NARRATIVE CONSTRUCTION OF REALITY, CRITICAL INQUIRY, 18, 1, PP. 1-21, (1991); BURTON L., MATHEMATICAL THINKING: THE STRUGGLE FOR MEANING, JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION, 15, 1, PP. 35-49, (1984); CALARCO J.M., ANDERSON E., MEANWELL E., KNOPF A., ‘LET’S NOT PRETEND IT’S FUN’: A MIXED-METHODS ANALYSIS OF INCREASED TIME WITH CHILDREN AND MOTHERS’ WELL-BEING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

THE CHAPTER PROVIDES PRACTICAL ADVICE REGARDING TASK DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF ACTIVITIES THAT ENCOURAGE CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF STATISTICAL TEXTS (SUCH AS IN THE NEWS MEDIA OR PUBLICATIONS OF OFFICIAL STATISTICS AGENCIES). KEY TOPICS INCLUDE: ANALYSIS OF THE NATURE OF ‘CONTEXT KNOWLEDGE’ AND WHAT ARE ‘MEANINGFUL AND IMPORTANT’ CONTEXTS THAT ARE WORTHY OF ATTENTION WHEN TEACHING FOR UNDERSTANDING OF CIVIC STATISTICS; WAYS TO BRING ‘MEANINGFUL AND IMPORTANT’ CONTEXTS AND TEXTS ABOUT THEM (E.G., FROM NEWSPAPERS OR DIGITAL MEDIA) INTO THE CLASSROOM AND TO MAKE SURE STUDENTS UNDERSTAND THEM; IDEAS ABOUT QUESTION-POSING AND DESIGNING SUITABLE TASKS ABOUT THESE MEANINGFUL AND IMPORTANT CONTEXTS, IN PARTICULAR HOW TO SHAPE ‘OPINION QUESTIONS’ THAT CAN ELICIT STUDENTS’ CRITICAL READING, REFLECTIVE THINKING, AND COMMUNICATION OF THOUGHTFUL OPINIONS; AND IDEAS ABOUT THE DISPOSITIONS AND HABITS OF MIND (E.G., CRITICAL STANCE, ABILITY TO ASK ‘WORRY QUESTIONS’) AND SKILLS (E.G., READING COMPREHENSION, CRITICAL INTERPRETATION) WE WANT STUDENTS TO INTERNALIZED AND BE ABLE TO ACTIVATE WHEN ENGAGING STATISTICAL MESSAGES. BASED ON THE GUIDELINES AND EXAMPLES REGARDING THESE TOPICS, THE CHAPTER DISCUSSES IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CURRICULUM DESIGN AND FOR TEACHING AND TEACHERS WORKING BOTH AT THE HIGH-SCHOOL, COLLEGE, AND ADULT EDUCATION CONTEXTS, IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION, STATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, AND RELATED STEM DISCIPLINES. © SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERL AND AG 2022.","CONTEXTUALIZATION;

IN RESPONSE, THERE HAS BEEN GROWING ATTENTION IN RESEARCH AND PRACTICE EMPHASIZING PRE-COLLEGE GROUPS. THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE GROWING RECOGNITION-REFLECTED IN INITIATIVES LIKE CS4ALL, CODE.ORG, BOOTSTRAP: DATA SCIENCE, EXPLORING COMPUTER SCIENCE-THAT LEARNING EXPERIENCES BEFORE COLLEGE ARE CONSEQUENTIAL IN SUSTAINING A ROBUST PIPELINE OF COMPUTER SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS. DESPITE THESE INROADS, THERE IS JUSTIFIABLE CONCERN THAT EXISTING EFFORTS MIGHT NOT FULLY SUPPORT LEARNER DEVELOPMENT IN THE NECESSARY CONCEPTUAL, EPISTEMOLOGICAL, AND HEURISTIC STYLES NEEDED TO PRODUCTIVELY PARSE AND UNDERSTAND 'BIG DATA.' THIS IS BECAUSE COMPUTING-BASED CURRICULA THAT INCLUDE DATA SCIENCE OFTEN INVOLVE DATA CURATED BY OTHERS (RATHER THAN LEARNERS DIRECTLY), WHICH RESULTS IN SIMULATED VERSIONS OF PRACTICE INSTEAD OF ENGAGEMENT THAT IS REALISTICALLY DISCURSIVE AND MESSY. THIS IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE PERSISTENT SHORTAGE OF K-12 COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS IN GENERAL AND EVEN FEWER WHO CAN DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT CURRICULA THAT SUPPORT AUTHENTIC ENGAGEMENT WITH DATA SCIENCE. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, WE LEVERAGE CULTURALLY RELEVANT AND CONSTRUCTIONIST PERSPECTIVES IN A SANDBOX (I.E., OPEN-ENDED) SCIENCE WHERE TOOLS LIKE SCRATCH AND ELECTRONIC TEXTILES (E-TEXTILES) HAVE HAD SUCCESS EXPANDING POSSIBILITIES IN COMPUTING TO ALSO INCLUDE ACTIVITIES WHERE LEARNERS CAN ENGAGE BROADLY ALONG VARIED PURSUITS-AND ENCOUNTER CHALLENGES THAT SPUR COMPUTATIONAL THINKING AND PROBLEM-SOLVING. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT LEARNING ACTIVITIES FRAMED IN THIS WAY ENCOURAGE KNOWLEDGE CONSTRUCTION, PRACTICE LITERACIES, AND SERIOUSLY IMPACT LEARNER ATTITUDES, INTEREST, AND PERCEPTIONS OF GROWTH IN THE FIELD. THIS LATTER SET OF SELF-CONCEPT MEASURES REPRESENTS A FEW OF MANY RELATED KEY PREDICTORS OF LONG-TERM FIELD PARTICIPATION AND PERSISTENCE. IN THIS WORK-IN-PROGRESS SCHOLARSHIP OF DISCOVERY RESEARCH, WE CO-DEVELOP, WITH YOUTH AND EDUCATORS, 'CODING LIKE A DATA MINER' (CLDM)-A SANDBOX APPROACH TO COMPUTING-BASED DATA SCIENCE WHEREIN LEARNERS ACCESS A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM, TWITTER, TO MINE, ANALYZE, AND UNDERSTAND QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA SOURCES. IN THIS PRELIMINARY WORK, WE ASSESS AFFORDANCES IN CO-DEVELOPING A CURRICULUM THAT LEVERAGES SANDBOX APPROACHES TO DATA SCIENCE. ULTIMATELY (AND WHAT WILL BE PRESENTED IN OUR FINAL SUBMISSION), WE AIM TO STUDY LEARNING OUTCOMES WHEN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS' ACCESS, ANALYZE AND MAKE SENSE OF 'BIG DATA' SETS OF THEIR OWN. WE COLLABORATED WITH HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS IN A WEST TEXAS/PASO DEL NORTE REGION WHERE COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATORS ARE EXCEPTIONALLY SCARCE AND WHERE THERE IS AN URGENT AND PERSISTENT NEED TO SUPPORT UNDERREPRESENTED LEARNER ACCESS TO BURGEONING AREAS OF COMPUTING. USING MIXED-METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES (E.G., QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF LEARNER PRE- AND POST-SURVEY RESPONSES ALONG WITH QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW DATA), WE ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT AFFORDANCES EXIST USING CO-DESIGN APPROACHES TO DEVELOP SANDBOX DATA SCIENCE FOR PRE-COLLEGE LEARNERS? (2) WHICH COMPUTATIONAL CONCEPTS DO STUDENTS LEARN WHEN CARRYING OUT CLDM ACTIVITIES, (3) WHICH COMPUTATIONAL PRACTICES DO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ENACT WHEN MINING, PROCESSING, AND ANALYZING BIG DATA SETS IN CLDM? (4) HOW DO LEARNER KNOWLEDGE AND PERCEPTIONS ABOUT DATA SCIENCE SHIFT AFTER PARTICIPATING IN CLDM? WE USE CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVES IN COMPUTING EDUCATION, CONSTRUCTIONISM, AND EQUITY TO DISCUSS HOW OPEN-ENDED SANDBOX APPROACHES TO COMPUTING-BASED DATA SCIENCE SUPPORT LEARNER COMPUTATIONAL THINKING, PRACTICE LITERACIES, AND FIELD PERCEPTIONS. © 2023 IEEE.","COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION; COMPUTER SCIENCE LEARNING; CONSTRUCTIONISM; CURRICULUM DESIGN; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION","DIGITAL DEVICES; E-LEARNING; EDUCATION COMPUTING; ENGINEERING EDUCATION; SMART TEXTILES; SOCIAL NETWORKING (ONLINE); STUDENTS; COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION; COMPUTER SCIENCE LEARNING; CONSTRUCTIONISM; CURRICULA DESIGN; DATA MINERS; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; PRE-COLLEGE; SCIENCE EDUCATION; SCIENCE LEARNING; CURRICULA","","","","","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, (2137708); NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF","ACKNOWLEDGMENT THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED IN PART BY A GRANT FROM THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (#2137708).

IN RECENT YEARS, MACHINE LEARNING (ML) 'S SURGING IMPACT HAS SPARKED DISCOURSE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF AI EDUCATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, AND IN RECENT YEARS, SEVERAL INITIATIVES AND PROJECTS PURSUING THE MISSION OF K-12 AI EDUCATION HAVE EMERGED. IN 2020 ISRAEL'S MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (MOE) APPROVED A NEW COMPREHENSIVE AND RIGOROUS ML CURRICULUM TARGETING 11 AND 12TH-GRADE PUPILS MAJORING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (CS). THE CURRICULUM IS MEANT TO BE TAUGHT BY THE EXISTING CS TEACHER WORKFORCE. HOWEVER, SINCE ML THEORY AND PRACTICE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL CS [2], IMPLEMENTING THIS THOROUGH ML CURRICULUM POSES SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGES IN DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE TEACHING WORKFORCE TO DELIVER IT. IN THIS RESEARCH, WE SUGGEST A SOLUTION FOR THIS CHALLENGE IN THE FORM OF A BLENDED-LEARNING (BL) PROGRAM. THE ONLINE COMPONENT OF THIS PROGRAM IS BASED MAINLY ON COURSERA'S DEEP LEARNING SPECIALIZATION MOOCS SERIES [3]. THE BL PROGRAM, ENHANCED WITH PEDAGOGICAL TRAINING, IS ALSO USED FOR THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (PD) OF THE TEACHERS WHO DELIVER THE PROGRAM. OUT OF FOURTEEN CS TEACHERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE PD IN THE SUMMER OF 2021, TEN TEACH THE BL PROGRAM THIS YEAR TO 273 HIGH-SCHOOL PUPILS.

NEW DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE BEING LAUNCHED AT AN INCREASING RATE, ARE DESIGNED FOR MULTIPLE EDUCATION LEVELS AND POPULATIONS. MACHINE LEARNING (ML) IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF DATA SCIENCE THAT REQUIRES AN EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND IN MATHEMATICS. WHEREAS IT IS POSSIBLE TO TEACH THE PRINCIPLES OF ML ONLY AS A BLACK BOX, NOVICE LEARNERS MIGHT FIND IT DIFFICULT TO IMPROVE AN ALGORITHM’S PERFORMANCE WITHOUT A WHITE BOX UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING ML ALGORITHMS. IN THIS PAPER, WE SUGGEST A PEDAGOGICAL METHOD, BASED ON HANDS-ON PEN-AND-PAPER TASKS, TO SUPPORT WHITE BOX UNDERSTANDING OF ML ALGORITHMS FOR LEARNERS WHO LACK THE LEVEL OF MATHEMATICS KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED FOR THIS PURPOSE. DATA WERE COLLECTED USING A COMPREHENSION QUESTIONNAIRE AND ANALYZED ACCORDING TO THE PROCESS-OBJECT THEORY BORROWED FROM MATHEMATICS EDUCATION RESEARCH. WE PRESENT EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS METHOD BASED ON DATA COLLECTED IN AN INTRODUCTION-LEVEL DATA SCIENCE COURSE FOR GRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS. THIS POPULATION HAD EXTENSIVE PSYCHOLOGY DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE, AS WELL AS AN ESTABLISHED BACKGROUND IN STATISTICS, BUT HAD GAPS IN MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE COMPARED WITH DATA SCIENCE MAJORS. THE RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION IS BOTH PRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL. PRACTICALLY, WE PRESENT A LEARNING MODULE THAT SUPPORTS NON-MAJOR DATA SCIENCE STUDENTS’ WHITE BOX UNDERSTANDING OF ML. THEORETICALLY, WE PROPOSE A DATA ANALYSIS METHOD TO EVALUATE STUDENTS’ CONCEPTIONS OF ML ALGORITHMS. © 2022","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; MACHINE LEARNING; PROCESS-OBJECT DUALITY THEORY; STATISTICS EDUCATION RESEARCH","","","","","","MLIS; TECHNION’S MACHINE LEARNING & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS; TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY, ТАУ; TECHNION-ISRAEL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY GENEROUS FUNDING FROM THE TECHNION’S MACHINE LEARNING & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (MLIS) CENTER.

THESE PROGRAMS FOCUS ON DEVELOPING BOTH ""CLASSIC""INFORMATION SCIENCE COMPETENCIES AS WELL AS CORE DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES AMONG THEIR STUDENTS. SINCE DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL THINKING, DEPARTMENTAL OFFICIALS AND PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS OFTEN RAISE CONCERNS REGARDING THE APPROPRIATE BACKGROUND STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE IN ORDER TO SUCCEED IN THIS NEWLY INTRODUCED COMPUTATIONAL CONTENT OF THE LIS TRAINING PROGRAMS. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS, WE REPORT ON AN EXPLORATORY STUDY THROUGH WHICH WE EXAMINED THE 2020 AND 2021 STUDENT CLASSES OF BAR-ILAN UNIVERSITY'S LIS GRADUATE TRAINING, FOCUSING ON THE COMPUTATIONAL DATA SCIENCE COURSES (I.E., SUPERVISED AND UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING). OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT CONTRARY TO MANY OF THE CONCERNS RAISED, STUDENTS FROM THE HUMANITIES PERFORMED AS WELL (AND IN SOME CASES SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER) ON DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES COMPARED TO THOSE FROM THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HAD BETTER SUCCESS IN THE TRAINING PROGRAM AS A WHOLE. IN ADDITION, STUDENTS' UNDERGRADUATE GPA ACTED AS AN ADEQUATE INDICATOR FOR BOTH THEIR SUCCESS IN THE TRAINING PROGRAM AND IN THE DATA SCIENCE PART THEREOF. IN ADDITION, WE FIND NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT CONCERNS REGARDING AGE OR SEX. FINALLY, OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE COMPUTATIONAL DATA SCIENCE PART OF STUDENTS' TRAINING IS VERY MUCH ALIGNED WITH THE REST OF THEIR TRAINING PROGRAM. © ASSOCIATION FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE EDUCATION, 2023.","COMPUTATIONAL DATA SCIENCE TRAINING; DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION","","","","","","","","ADER H.

ONE OF THE KEY REASONS FOR STUDENT ATTRITION IS THE INABILITY OF STUDENTS TO DEVELOP AN IDENTITY AND A SENSE OF BELONGING. THIS STUDY AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF A DATA SCIENCE LEARNING COMMUNITY IN HELPING STUDENTS TO DEVELOP IDENTITY AND A SENSE OF BELONGING. THE STUDY USED A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE THE DATA. THE STUDY USED A PRE–POST SURVEY TO UNDERSTAND STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS REGARDING IDENTITY FORMATION AND SENSE OF BELONGING. THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY STUDY INDICATED THAT THE PERCEPTION OF IDENTITY FORMATION AND SENSE OF BELONGING INCREASED AS STUDENTS PROGRESSED THROUGH THE SEMESTER. TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE REASONS FOR THE INCREASE IN THE PERCEPTION OF IDENTITY FORMATION AND SENSE OF BELONGING, IN-DEPTH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED. THE RESULTS OF THE INTERVIEW REVEALED THAT LIVING IN THE DATA SCIENCE LEARNING COMMUNITY, PARTICIPATING IN VARIOUS EVENTS AND INTERACTING WITH FACULTY, STAFF AND WORKING WITH PEERS OF SIMILAR INTEREST HELPED STUDENTS TO DEVELOP A DATA SCIENCE IDENTITY AND LEADER IDENTITY, AS WELL AS EXPERIENCE SENSE OF BELONGING. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.","COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; IDENTITY FORMATION; LEARNING COMMUNITY; SENSE OF BELONGING; UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","","","","","","PURDUE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST; LILLY ENDOWMENT","THIS RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED IN PART BY THE LILLY ENDOWMENT CHARTING THE FUTURE PHASE I PLANNING GRANT, THROUGH THE PURDUE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST.

AS BOTH ACADEMIA AND INDUSTRY STRIVE TO INTEGRATE APPLIED LEARNING, TRANSFERABLE AND ENTERPRISE SKILLS INTO BUSINESS AND SCIENCES, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A DESIGN BASED RESEARCH APPROACH (DBR) FOR DESIGNING SUCH A NEW INTERDISCIPLINARY DATA SCIENCE TEACHING CURRICULUM AS A FOUNDATION TO DELIVER BUSINESS UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES IN BUSINESS DATA SCIENCE. ADOPTING A DESIGN SCIENCE METHOD OUR PROPOSED DBR ILLUSTRATES EFFECTIVE UTILITIES FOR CONCEPTUALISING AND EVALUATING A FULLY FUNCTIONAL NEW DEGREE PROGRAMME - BACHELOR OF BUSINESS DATA SCIENCE. TEN SENIOR BUSINESS INFORMATION SYSTEMS ACADEMICS AND FIVE ANALYTICS INDUSTRY PRACTITIONERS IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA WERE INTERVIEWED IN THREE ITERATIVE PROTOTYPING PHASES FOLLOWED BY A FINAL FOCUS GROUP SESSION WITH BUSINESS INFORMATION SYSTEMS STUDENTS THAT EVALUATED THE PROPOSED STRUCTURE. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PROPOSED DBR ENSURES THE DESIGN OF AN INNOVATIVE DATA SCIENCE DEGREE THAT MAY MEET GROWING INDUSTRY AND INTERDISCIPLINARY DEMANDS.

ASSIGNMENTS AND PROJECTS ARE ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THE DS CURRICULUM AS THEY ENABLE STUDENTS TO GAIN HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE IN REAL-WORLD DS TASKS. HOWEVER, MOST CURRENT ASSIGNMENTS AND PROJECTS ARE LACKING IN AT LEAST ONE OF TWO WAYS: 1) THEY DO NOT COMPREHENSIVELY TEACH ALL THE STEPS INVOLVED IN THE COMPLETE WORKFLOW OF DS PROJECTS; 2) STUDENTS WORK ON SEPARATE PROBLEMS INDIVIDUALLY OR IN SMALL TEAMS, LIMITING THE SCALE AND IMPACT OF THEIR SOLUTIONS. TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS, WE ENVISION NOVEL SYNERGISTIC MODULAR ASSIGNMENTS WHERE A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WORK COLLECTIVELY ON ALL THE TASKS EQUIRED TO DEVELOP A LARGE-SCALE DS PRODUCT. THE RESULTING PRODUCT CAN BE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVED WITH STUDENTS' CONTRIBUTIONS EVERY SEMESTER. WE REPORT OUR EXPERIENCE WITH DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING SUCH AN ASSIGNMENT IN AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL COURSE. THROUGH THE ASSIGNMENT, STUDENTS COLLECTIVELY DEVELOPED A SEARCH ENGINE FOR FINDING EXPERT FACULTY SPECIALIZING IN A GIVEN FIELD. THIS SHOWS THE UTILITY OF SUCH ASSIGNMENTS BOTH FOR TEACHING USEFUL DS SKILLS AND DRIVING INNOVATION AND RESEARCH. WE SHARE USEFUL LESSONS FOR OTHER INSTRUCTORS TO ADOPT SIMILAR ASSIGNMENTS FOR THEIR DS COURSES. © 2020 COPYRIGHT HELD BY THE OWNER/AUTHOR(S).

THIS WORK DEPICTS THE INTERDISCIPLINARY LANDSCAPE OF ISCHOOLS FROM RESEARCH OUTCOMES PUBLICATION KNOWLEDGE  DIFFUSION INPUT REFERENCE OUTPUT CITATION AND SCHOOL LEVEL BASED ON THE WOS PUBLICATIONS OF 36 ICAUCUS MEMBERS IN ISCHOOLS FROM 2009 TO 2018. INTERDISCIPLINARITY IS MEASURED BY THREE INDICATORS NAMELY VARIETY BALANCE AND INTENSITY. WE FOUND THAT 1 THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERISTICS OF RESEARCH OUTCOMES ARE HIGH SUBJECT VARIETY AND HIGH SUBJECT IMBALANCE. FIRSTLY THE PAPERS PUBLISHED BY ISCHOOLS INCLUDE 227 DISCIPLINES COVERING 89. 37% OF THE WOS SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION THE NUMBER OF DISCIPLINES INVOLVED IN THE PAPERS IS GENERALLY INCREASING. SECONDLY THE PUBLICATIONS ARE RELATIVELY CONCENTRATED ON A FEW DISCIPLINES SUCH AS LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE. IN ADDITION THE OVERALL INTERDISCIPLINARY INTENSITY OF RESEARCH OUTCOMES IS 56. 81% WHICH MEANS 56. 81% OF PUBLICATIONS INVOLVED TWO OR MORE DISCIPLINES REFLECTING THEIR MULTIDISCIPLINARY NATURE. 2 THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERISTICS OF KNOWLEDGE DIFFUSION ARE HIGH SUBJECT VARIETY AND RELATIVELY HIGH SUBJECT IMBALANCE. FIRSTLY KNOWLEDGE INPUT AND KNOWLEDGE OUTPUT COVER AROUND 254 WOS SUBJECT CLASSIFICATIONS WHICH SHOWS RESEARCHES OF ISCHOOLS ARE RELATIVELY OPEN. SECONDLY ACCORDING TO THE CUMULATIVE PERCENTAGE OF THE DISCIPLINARY DISTRIBUTION THE TOP TEN DISCIPLINES IN KNOWLEDGE INPUT AND OUTPUT HAVE RESPECTIVELY REACHED 44% AND 46% INDICATING THE RELATIVE CONCENTRATION OF KNOWLEDGE DIFFUSION. IN ADDITION THE INTERDISCIPLINARY INTENSITY OF KNOWLEDGE INPUT IS 54. 71% INDICATING THAT ISCHOOLS HAVE CITED MANY PAPERS FROM OTHER DISCIPLINES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT IS MAINLY RELATED TO THE CROSS-BORDER INTEGRATION OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE. THE INTERDISCIPLINARY INTENSITY OF KNOWLEDGE OUTPUT IS 55. 11% WHICH INDICATES THAT ISCHOOLS PAPERS HAVE BEEN WIDELY CITED BY PAPERS FROM OTHER DISCIPLINES AND ISCHOOLS HAVE FORMED A STRONG CAPACITY TO OUTPUT AND TO INFILTRATE KNOWLEDGE TO OTHER DISCIPLINES. 3 THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERISTICS OF ISCHOOLS MEMBERS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. THE INTERDISCIPLINARY DIVERSITY OF UC IRVINE CORNELL UNIVERSITY AND MONASH UNIVERSITY ARE AT THE FOREFRONT WHILE THE INTERDISCIPLINARY DIVERSITY OF HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY AND RENMIN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA LAG BEHIND. UC IRVINE AND CORNELL UNIVERSITY PUBLISH VERY LOW PERCENTAGES OF PAPERS IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION  SCIENCE. ACCORDING TO THE FACTOR ANALYSIS OF RESEARCH OUTCOMES KNOWLEDGE INPUT AND KNOWLEDGE OUTPUT 36 COLLEGES CAN BE DIVIDED INTO SIX CATEGORIES LIBRARY INFORMATION COMPUTER SCIENCE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION RESEARCH COMMUNICATION AND MANAGEMENT. THE NUMBER OF COLLEGES IN THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CATEGORY IS THE LARGEST. 4 LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IS CLOSELY RELATED TO IFIELD BUT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ALSO EXIST. LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IS THE SUBJECT WITH THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF RESEARCH OUTPUTS AND THE MOST IMPORTANT SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE IFIELD. BUT THE PROPORTION IS NOT HIGH WITH 22. 87% IN RESEARCH OUTCOMES 13. 05% IN REFERENCE AND 8. 88% IN CITED PAPER. IT ALSO INDICATES A DOWNWARD TREND OVER TIME. THE TENDENCY OF ISCHOOLS TO ELIMINATE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IS OBVIOUS. IN ADDITION THOUGH MANY COLLEGES ARE CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE SUBJECT MANY OF THEM HAVE A CLEAR TREND OF DIVERSIFICATION. THERE ARE SEVERAL LIMITATIONS IN THIS STUDY. TAKING THE ICAUCUS MEMBER AS AN EXAMPLE TO EXPLORE THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERISTICS OF ISCHOOLS RESEARCHES THE GENERALIZABILITY OF ITS CONCLUSIONS NEEDS TO BE FURTHER VERIFIED. SECOND IN ADDITION TO THE DIVERSITY BALANCE AND INTENSITY COMBINING WITH MORE COMPREHENSIVE INDICATORS MAY MAKE THE CONCLUSION MORE CREDIBLE AND COMPLETE. FINALLY THE SAMPLE DATA FROM WOS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO IMPLEMENT A THOROUGH BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS. 4 FIGS. 7 TABS. 56 REFS. © 2020, EDITORIAL OFFICE OF JOURNAL OF LIBRARY SCIENCE IN CHINA.

STUDENTS OF DATA SCIENCE AREA USUALLY FACE THE DIFFICULTY OF UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX OF REAL-TIME DATA AND SOPHISTICATED STATISTICAL INDICATORS AND MODELS. ANOTHER DIFFICULTY IS STUDENTS ARE EASY TO LOST INTERESTS AND PATIENCE DURING THE PROCESS OF LEARNING PROGRAMMING AND ANALYSIS PROCESS, SUCH AS R-LANGUAGE. STOCK MARKET, AS A HUGE DATA SOURCE AND AN IMPORTANT DATA DISCIPLINARY, IS COMPARATIVELY EASY TO ATTRACT STUDENT ATTENTIONS. THUS, WE DEVELOPED AN INTUITIVE TRADING PLATFORM FOR EDUCATION PURPOSE. THE PLATFORM CONTAINS THREE COMPONENTS: AN EXPLORING WINDOW, A CONTROL WINDOWS AND A REPORT WINDOW. THE EXPLORING WINDOW SHOWS CURRENT AND HISTORICAL STOCK PRICE TRENDS AND RELATED INDICATORS. SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVE STOCKS FROM DIFFERENT SECTORS CAN BE PICKED AND SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES CAN BE ASSIGNED. THE CONTROL WINDOW ALLOWS STUDENTS TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN TRADING STRATEGIES. A TRADING STRATEGY CAN BE CREATED BY EITHER INTUITIVE WAY, OR THROUGH SINGLE OR COMBINATIONS OF INDICATORS, OR BE BUILT GENERICALLY THOUGH PLUG-IN R-PROGRAMING MODULE. THE REPORT WINDOW DEMONSTRATES THE EXPECTED RETURN OF A STOCK IN A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME THROUGH A SPECIFIC STRATEGY. A MORE COMPREHENSIVE REPORT WITH DETAILED TRANSACTION INFORMATION IS ALSO PROVIDED FOR BACK-TESTING PURPOSE. STUDENTS ARE INVOLVED INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOFTWARE AND GET EXPERIENCE FOR R-PROGRAMMING. PRELIMINARY VERSION OF THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN TESTED AND SURVEYED IN A DATA SCIENCE CLASSROOM. ABOUT TEN JUNIOR DATA SCIENCE STUDENTS HAVE PRACTICED AND PROVIDED FEEDBACK. THE POSITIVE SURVEY RESULTS SHOW THE FEASIBILITY OF THE APPROACH. IN THE FUTURE, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT COMPONENT WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THE PLATFORM.  © 2020 IEEE.","DATA SCIENCE; R-PROGRAMMING; TRADING PLATFORM","COMMERCE; DATA SCIENCE; EDUCATION COMPUTING; ELECTRONIC TRADING; FINANCIAL MARKETS; SURVEYS; ANALYSIS PROCESS; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT; PROCESS OF LEARNING; SCIENCE CLASSROOM; SCIENCE EDUCATION; STATISTICAL INDICATORS; TRADING STRATEGIES; TRANSACTION INFORMATION; STUDENTS","","","","","","","METZ C., (2017); WLADAWSKY-BERGER I., THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, (2017); SEMENEY A., (2017); MACHINE LEARNING FOR STOCK TRADING STRATEGIES, (2016); GREG WALTERS S., (2017)","","","INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC.","","2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND EDUCATIONAL INFORMATIZATION, CSEI 2020","12 JUNE 2020 THROUGH 14 JUNE 2020","XINXIANG","161915","","978-172817007-7","","","ENGLISH","PROC.

IN THIS WORK, WE BUILD AN EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE EXTRACTION SYSTEM TO AUTOMATE THE INTEGRATION OF TABLES (IN THE PAPER PDFS) INTO A DATABASE OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. FIRST, IT CROPS THE TABLES AND RECOGNIZES THE TEMPLATES. SECOND, IT CLASSIFIES THE COLUMN NAMES AND ROW NAMES INTO ""METHOD"", ""DATASET"", OR ""EVALUATION METRIC"", AND THEN UNIFIED ALL THE TABLE CELLS INTO (METHOD, DATASET, METRIC, SCORE)-QUADRUPLES. WE PROPOSE HYBRID FEATURES INCLUDING STRUCTURAL AND SEMANTIC TABLE FEATURES AS WELL AS AN ENSEMBLE LEARNING APPROACH FOR COLUMN/ROW NAME CLASSIFICATION AND TABLE UNIFICATION.

PROJECT-BASED LEARNING (PBL) IS A WELL-KNOWN PEDAGOGICAL TOOL FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY EDUCATION. IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISH INTERDISCIPLINARY LEARNING, STUDENTS MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE IN EACH OF THE SEPARATE DISCIPLINES. USE OF CROSS-DISCIPLINARY TEAMS, FOR EXAMPLE, IS ONE WAY TO MAKE SURE A PROJECT TEAM INCLUDES SPECIALISTS IN ALL REQUIRED DISCIPLINES. THIS, HOWEVER, IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE. IN MANY CASES, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS WITHIN THE PROJECT TEAM IN ONE OR MORE OF THE PROJECT DOMAINS. SPECIFICALLY, IN OUR CASE, FOURTH-YEAR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS ARE WORKING IN PAIRS ON BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING PROJECTS, WHICH ARE EVIDENTLY INTERDISCIPLINARY IN NATURE. THE TEAMS, HOWEVER, ARE HOMOGENEOUS AND THE STUDENTS LACK THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL EXPERTISE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE SOLUTIONS APPLICABLE BY PHYSICIANS. FURTHERMORE, STUDENTS TEND TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS GAP ONLY IN THE ADVANCED PHASES OF THE PROJECT, AND SO CRITICAL PHASES, SUCH AS GOAL SETTING AND PLANNING, ARE PERFORMED WITHOUT THE REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PRESENT (A) DATA THAT SUPPORTS THE EXISTENCE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP AND ITS EFFECT ON STUDENTS; (B) AN INTERVENTION PROGRAM THAT EXPOSES STUDENTS TO BOTH THE REQUIRED DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE AND ITS IMPORTANCE TO THEIR WORK; AND (C) INITIAL DATA THAT SUPPORTS THE SUCCESS OF THIS INTERVENTION PROGRAM IN BRIDGING THESE GAPS. © 2020 IEEE.","BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; INTERDISCIPLINARY EDUCATION; PROJECT-BASED LEARNING","BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING; C (PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE); ENGINEERING EDUCATION; CROSS-DISCIPLINARY TEAMS; ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS; INTERDISCIPLINARY EDUCATION; INTERDISCIPLINARY LEARNING; INTERVENTION PROGRAMS; PEDAGOGICAL TOOLS; PROJECT BASED LEARNING; REAL-LIFE PROBLEMS; STUDENTS","","","","","","","ALVARGONZA D., MULTIDISCIPLINARITY, INTERDISCIPLINARITY, TRANSDISCIPLINARITY, AND THE SCIENCES, INT.

ALTHOUGH SOME STANDALONE PROGRAMS IN DATA SCIENCE HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AROUND THE COUNTRY, MANY INSTITUTIONS ENCOUNTER THE CHALLENGES IN BALANCING THE CURRICULA AMONG DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES, ALLOCATING NEW RESOURCES, AND COOPERATING WITH THE EXISTING MAJORS REGARDING ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT, STUDENT ADVISING, AND FACULTY PREPARATION.

WHILE THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK IS NOT A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL APPROACH, IT PROVIDES A DOABLE ROUTE FOR BLENDING DATA SCIENCE INTO COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION IN SYSTEMATIC WAYS. IT HAS BECOME THE CONSENSUS THAT AN ADEQUATE EXPOSURE TO DATA SCIENCE WILL BETTER PREPARE COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENTS FOR TAKING THE CHALLENGES IN THIS EVER-CHANGING, DATA EMBRACED WORLD. © 2019 IEEE.","COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION; CURRICULUM DESIGN; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION","BLENDING; CURRICULA; DATA SCIENCE; EDUCATION COMPUTING; ENGINEERING EDUCATION; STUDENTS; COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION; COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAMS; COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENTS; COST SAVING; CURRICULUM DESIGNS; ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT; LIBRARY SCIENCE; SCIENCE EDUCATION; INFORMATION MANAGEMENT","","","","","","","BERMAN F., RUTENBAR R., HAILPERN B., CHRISTENSEN H., DAVIDSON S., ESTRIN D., FRANKLIN M., MARTONOSI M., RAGHAVAN P., STODDEN V., SZALAY A.S., REALIZING THE POTENTIAL OF DATA SCIENCE, THE COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM, 61, 4, PP. 67-72, (2018); BURTCH L., THE BURTCH WORKS STUDY: SALARIES OF DATA SCIENTISTS, (2018); CAO L., DATA SCIENCE: A COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW, THE ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS, 50, 3, PP. 431-4342, (2017); CARSON C., CULLER D., JACOBSEN B., BERKELEY'S UNDERGRADUATE DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM: YEAR 1 PEDAGOGICAL OVERVIEW, (2018); DE VEAUX R.D., AGARWAL M., AVERETT M., BAUMER B.S., BRAY A., BRESSOUD T.C., BRYANT L., CHENG L.Z., FRANCIS A., GOULD R., KIM A.Y., KRETCHMAR M., LU Q., MOSKOL A., NOLAN D., PELAYO R., RALEIGH S., SETHI R.J., SONDJAJA M., TIRUVILUAMALA N., UHLIG P.X., WASHINGTON T.M., WESLEY C.L., WHITE D., YE P., CURRICULUM GUIDELINES FOR UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS IN DATA SCIENCE, THE ANNUAL REVIEW OF STATISTICS AND ITS APPLICATION, 4, PP. 21-216, (2017); DEMCHENKO Y., BELLOUM A., WIKTORSKI T., EDISON DATA SCIENCE FRAMEWORK: PART 1.

THUS, RESEARCHERS HAVE SUGGESTED THE URGENCY FOR UNIVERSITIES TO REVIEW THEIR CURRICULAR AS THE WORLD IS HEADING TOWARDS DATA ERA. THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO ANALYZE THE CURRENT SKILL-GAPS NEEDS FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ESTABLISH DATA SCIENCE POSTGRADUATE PROGRAMME THAT REFLECTS THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND MARKET DEMANDS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DAR ES SALAAM (UDSM). A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED TO 85 IDENTIFIED ORGANIZATIONS TO SOLICIT INFORMATION ON THE NEEDS FOR DATA SCIENTISTS AND EXISTING SKILL GAPS. A TOTAL OF 61 FILLED QUESTIONNAIRES RESPONSE WERE RECEIVED OUT OF THE 85 THAT WERE ADMINISTERED TO SELECTED ORGANIZATIONS INDICATING A TURN OUT RATE OF OVER 70%. OVERALL THE ANALYZED DATA ARTICULATED A COMPELLING EVIDENCE FOR THE LOCAL INDUSTRY GROWING NEED FOR DATA SCIENTIST. THE SURVEY THAT WAS CONDUCTED WAS FOLLOWED UP BY CONDUCT OF VARIOUS WORKSHOPS AND MEETINGS TO SOLICIT INPUTS FROM DIFFERENT EXPERTS AND STAKEHOLDERS ON DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE DEVELOPED CURRICULUM. FINALLY, A NEW PROGRAMME IN MSC IN DATA SCIENCE WAS APPROVED AND ESTABLISHED FROM APRIL 2018 AT UDSM. DESPITE ITS LATE APPROVAL AND WITHOUT FORMAL ADVERTISEMENT ON THE PUBLIC MEDIA, THE PROGRAMME ATTRACTED A LARGE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS FOR 2018/19 ACADEMIC YEAR, COMPARED TO OTHER SEVERAL POSTGRADUATE PROGRAMMES IN ICT OFFERED AT UDSM. &#X00A9; 2019, IFIP INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR INFORMATION PROCESSING.","DATA SCIENCE; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; DATA SCIENTISTS; ICT; SKILLS-GAP; UDSM","COMMERCE; DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; SOCIAL ASPECTS; SURVEYS; CURRENT DEMANDS; DATA SCIENTISTS; INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR INFORMATION PROCESSING; POSTGRADUATE EDUCATION; SCIENCE EDUCATION; SKILLS GAPS; TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS; UDSM; DATA SCIENCE","","","","","PEPFAR/MCC; UNIVERSITY OF DAR ES SALAAM","SOUTH AFRICAN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS STANDS BY FAR AS AFRICAN LEADING INSTITUTIONS IN PROVISION OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION INCLUDING THE AFRICAN INSTITUTE FOR MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES (AIMS) SOUTH AFRICA [11] WHICH OFFERS TWO MONTHS INTENSIVE DATA SCIENCE TRAINING AND THE UNIVERSITY OF WITWATERSRAND [12], OFFERING A ONE YEAR DEGREE PROGRAM IN BIG DATA ANALYTICS. TANZANIA HAS NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND, IN THIS DYNAMICS AS THERE HAS BEEN A FEW INITIATIVES THAT AIM TO STRENGTHEN DATA USE AND DATA DRIVEN INNOVATION ALTHOUGH LARGELY FUNDED THROUGH INTERNATIONAL DONOR PROGRAMS. AS PART OF OPEN GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIP (OGP) MEMBERSHIP THE COUNTRY IMPLEMENTED A BASIC STATISTICS PUBLIC DATA PORTAL, AND RECEIVED DATA CAPACITY BUILDING SUPPORT THROUGH THE WORLD BANK AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL DONOR AGENCIES [13]. THE BASIC STATISTICS PORTAL [14] WAS ESTABLISHED TO PROVIDE DATA IN A MACHINE READABLE FORMAT TO BE USED AND REUSED BY ANYBODY. THE DATA PROVIDED APPLY ONLY TO DATA AND INFORMATION PRODUCED OR COMMISSIONED BY GOVERNMENT ESPECIALLY THE PRIORITIZED SECTORS OF EDUCATION, WATER AND HEALTH. THE MOST RECENT NOTABLE PROGRAM FOR STRENGTHENING COUNTRY DATA CAPACITY IS THE TANZANIA DATA LAB PROJECT (DLAB) [15] THAT STARTED IN APRIL 2016 TO JUNE 2018 THAT SOUGHT TO PROMOTE GREATER DATA USE IN THE COUNTRY THROUGH FOSTERING DATA AVAILABILITY AND DATA LITERACY. THE DLAB PROJECT WAS LED BY THE UDSM THROUGH PEPFAR/MCC FUNDING, AND ONE KEY OUTCOME FROM THE PROJECT HAS BEEN THE MOTIVATION TO EXPAND DATA LITERACY THROUGH MAINSTREAMING THE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IN HIGHER LEARNING INSTITUTIONS.","MANYIKA J., ET AL., BIG DATA: THE NEXT FRONTIER FOR INNOVATION, COMPETITION, AND PRODUCTIVITY, (2011); BECKER T., CURRY E., JENTZSCH A., PALMETSHOFER W., NEW HORIZONS FOR A DATA-DRIVEN ECONOMY: ROADMAPS AND ACTION PLANS FOR TECHNOLOGY, BUSINESSES, POLICY, AND SOCIETY, PP. 277-291, (2016); AALST W.M.P., DATA SCIENTIST: THE ENGINEER OF THE FUTURE, ENTERPRISE INTEROPERABILITY VI.

THIS LEARNING MATERIAL IS ALSO COMPOSED OF MICROSOFT TEAMS, AND STUDENTS CAN ACCESS THE MATERIAL REMOTELY TO LEARN PROGRAMMING. IN THIS PAPER, SEVERAL STUDENTS ACTUALLY TRIED THIS MATERIAL.

AS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE IT INTEGRATES KNOWLEDGE AND METHODS FROM COMPUTER SCIENCE, MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS, AND THE DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE OF THE DATA. AS DATA SCIENCE IS STILL FORMING AS A DOMAIN, SEVERAL POINTS OF VIEW EXIST ON HOW TO TEACH DATA SCIENCE. THE CURRICULUM OF MANY UNDERGRADUATE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS INCLUDES ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN MATHEMATICS, STATISTICS, COMPUTER SCIENCE, AND ONE OR MORE DATA DOMAINS. SEVERAL INITIATIVES FOR DESIGNING HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE CURRICULA HAVE EMERGED RECENTLY. SINCE IT IS UNREALISTIC TO TEACH ALL THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ADVANCED TOPICS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL, THE HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM FOCUSES ON A BROAD UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW RATHER THAN ON MATHEMATICAL AND ALGORITHMIC DETAILS THAT CHARACTERIZE UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS. HIGH SCHOOL COMPUTER SCIENCE PUPILS, HOWEVER, ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF ALGORITHMS, AS ALGORITHMS ARE THE HEART OF COMPUTER SCIENCE. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT OUR ATTEMPT TO ADAPT A DATA SCIENCE COURSE TO COMPUTER SCIENCE HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS THAT INCORPORATES BOTH A BROAD VIEW ON DATA SCIENCE AND DATA WORKFLOW, AS WELL AS DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF DATA PROCESSING ALGORITHMS AND SPECIFICALLY, MACHINE LEARNING.

MANY TEACHERS’ PREPARATION FOR AND EXPERIENCES TEACHING STATISTICAL MODELING HAVE FOCUSED ON PROBABILISTIC MODELS. SUBSEQUENTLY, MUCH OF THE RESEARCH LITERATURE RELATED TO THE TEACHERS’ UNDERSTANDING HAS FOCUSED ON PROBABILISTIC MODELS. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE EXTENT TO WHICH SECONDARY STATISTICS TEACHERS APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND IDEAS OF STATISTICAL MODELING, SPECIFICALLY THE PROCESSES OF MODEL BUILDING AND EVALUATION, WHEN INTRODUCED USING CLASSIFICATION TREES, A TYPE OF ALGORITHMIC MODEL. RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT WHILE TEACHERS WERE ABLE TO READ AND BUILD CLASSIFICATION TREE MODELS, THEY EXPERIENCED MORE DIFFICULTY WHEN EVALUATING MODELS.

THE VIRTUES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY VIRTUOUS CYCLE (AKA VIRTUOUS HARDWARESOFTWARE CYCLE, INTEL-MICROSOFT VIRTUOUS CYCLE) THAT BUILT THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY (NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, THE NEW GLOBAL ECOSYSTEM IN ADVANCED COMPUTING: IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. COMPETITIVENESS AND NATIONAL SECURITY. THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES PRESS, WASHINGTON, DC, 2012) WERE BEING GROUNDED IN REALITY AND BEING SELF-PERPETUATING-MORE POWERFUL HARDWARE ENABLED MORE POWERFUL SOFTWARE THAT REQUIRED MORE POWERFUL HARDWARE, ENABLING YET MORE POWERFUL SOFTWARE, AND SO FORTH. BEING GROUNDED IN REALITY-SOLVING GENUINE PROBLEMS AT SCALE-WAS CRITICAL TO ITS SUCCESS, AS IT WILL BE FOR DATA SCIENCE. WHILE IT LASTED, IT WAS SELF-PERPETUATING, DUE TO A CONSTANT FLOW OF INNOVATION, AND TO BENEFITTING ALL PARTICIPANTS-PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS, THE INDUSTRY, THE ECONOMY, AND SOCIETY. IT IS A WONDERFUL SUCCESS STORY FOR TWENTIETH CENTURY APPLIED SCIENCE. GIVEN THE SUCCESS OF VIRTUOUS CYCLES IN DEVELOPING MODERN TECHNOLOGY, VIRTUOUS CYCLES GROUNDED IN REALITY SHOULD BE USED TO DEVELOP DATA SCIENCE, DRIVEN BY THE WISDOM OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY PROVERB, NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION. THIS CHAPTER EXPLORES THIS HYPOTHESIS USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE EVOLUTION OF DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS. FOR THE APPLICATION OF DATA SCIENCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND VIRTUOUS, IT SHOULD BE GROUNDED IN A CYCLE THAT ENCOMPASSES INDUSTRY (I.E., REAL PROBLEMS), RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DELIVERY. THIS CHAPTER PROPOSES APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES AND LESSONS OF THE VIRTUOUS CYCLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA SCIENCE APPLICATIONS; TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DATA SCIENCE DISCIPLINE ITSELF, FOR EXAMPLE, A DATA SCIENCE METHOD; AND TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; ALL FOCUSING ON THE CRITICAL ROLE OF COLLABORATION IN DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT, THEREBY ADDRESSING THE DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES FACED BY THE MORE THAN 150 DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH INSTITUTES (DSRIS) WORLDWIDE.

IN THIS PAPER, A THOROUGH COMPARATIVE STUDY BETWEEN INFORMATICS AND DATA SCIENCE WAS PRESENTED THROUGH COMPARING AND INVESTIGATING THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES OF THEIR CURRICULUM STRUCTURES, BODIES OF DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE, TECHNICAL SKILL SETS, RESEARCH AREAS, FACULTY PREPARATION, STUDENT BACKGROUND, AS WELL AS THE LESSONS LEARNT FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATICS PROGRAMS AND CHALLENGES IN DEVELOPING DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS DRAWN FROM THIS STUDY WILL ASSIST EDUCATORS TO BUILD THEIR DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS WITH THE CONFIDENCE AND DETERMINATION BUT WITHOUT HESITATION AND FEAR OF MISSTEPPING ALONG THE WAY IN PROMOTING AND BUILDING THEIR NEW PROGRAMS. © 2020 IEEE.","COMPARATIVE STUDY; CURRICULUM DESIGN; DATA SCIENCE; INFORMATICS; INFORMATICS AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION","APPLICATION PROGRAMS; CURRICULA; INFORMATICS; STUDENTS; ACADEMIC PROGRAM; COMPARATIVE STUDIES; CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT; CURRICULUM STRUCTURE; DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE; HIGHER EDUCATION; SCIENCE PROGRAMS; TECHNICAL SKILLS; DATA SCIENCE","","","","","","","INFORMATICS EDUCATION: EUROPE CANNOT AFFORD TO MISS THE BOAT.

IN DATA SCIENCES, THERE ARE TWO RELATED BUT DISTINCT STRATEGIES: HYPOTHESIS TESTING AND BINARY CLASSIFICATION. IN PRACTICE, HOW TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THESE TWO STRATEGIES CAN BE UNCLEAR AND RATHER CONFUSING. HERE, WE SUMMARIZE KEY DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THESE TWO STRATEGIES IN THREE ASPECTS AND LIST FIVE PRACTICAL GUIDELINES FOR DATA ANALYSTS TO CHOOSE THE APPROPRIATE STRATEGY FOR SPECIFIC ANALYSIS NEEDS. WE DEMONSTRATE THE USE OF THOSE GUIDELINES IN A CANCER DRIVER GENE PREDICTION EXAMPLE. IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, TWO ANALYSIS STRATEGIES, HYPOTHESIS TESTING AND BINARY CLASSIFICATION, ARE MOSTLY COVERED IN DIFFERENT COURSES AND TEXTBOOKS. IN REAL DATA APPLICATION, IT CAN BE PUZZLING WHETHER A BINARY DECISION PROBLEM SHOULD BE FORMULATED AS HYPOTHESIS TESTING OR BINARY CLASSIFICATION. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DISENTANGLE THE PUZZLE FOR DATA SCIENCE STUDENTS AND RESEARCHERS BY OFFERING PRACTICAL GUIDELINES FOR CHOOSING BETWEEN THE TWO STRATEGIES. HYPOTHESIS TESTING AND BINARY CLASSIFICATION ARE TWO DATA ANALYSIS STRATEGIES TAUGHT MOSTLY IN DIFFERENT UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES AND RARELY COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER. AS A RESULT, WHICH STRATEGY IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR A SPECIFIC REAL-WORLD DATA ANALYSIS TASK IS OFTEN AMBIGUOUS. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, THIS PERSPECTIVE ARTICLE CLARIFIES THE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO STRATEGIES AND OFFERS PRACTICAL GUIDELINES TO THE BROAD DATA SCIENCE DISCIPLINE. © 2020 THE AUTHOR(S)","DSML 1: CONCEPT: BASIC PRINCIPLES OF A NEW DATA SCIENCE OUTPUT OBSERVED AND REPORTED","DATA HANDLING; INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH; MACHINE LEARNING; TESTING; ANALYSIS STRATEGIES; BINARY CLASSIFICATION; HYPOTHESIS TESTING; PRACTICAL GUIDELINES; SCIENCE DISCIPLINES; SCIENCE EDUCATION; SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES; STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS TESTING; DATA SCIENCE","","","","","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, (1846216)","","LEHMANN E.L., ROMANO J.P., TESTING STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES, (2006); MURPHY K.P., MACHINE LEARNING: A PROBABILISTIC PERSPECTIVE, (2012); WASSERMAN L., ALL OF STATISTICS: A CONCISE COURSE IN STATISTICAL INFERENCE, (2013); DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN TWO GROUPS IN STATISTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING: HYPOTHESIS TEST VS.

THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON ADVANCED DATA ANALYTICS (ADA) IN BUSINESS MANAGEMENT. IN THE PROJECT, ADVANCED DATA ANALYTICS IS TAUGHT TO BOTH STUDENTS AT UNIVERSITY OF EASTERN FINLAND AND TO THEIR POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS AT THE LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE UNIVERSITY TEACHING FAVORS EFFECTIVE TEACHING TECHNIQUES INSTEAD OF CONVENTIONAL TEACHING METHODS, AND THE SAME TOPICS ARE TAUGHT TO PARTICIPANTS FROM LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AS SHORTER VERSIONS. THE ORGANIZATIONS ALSO HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CALIBRATING THE TEACHING VIA DISCUSSIONS AND MATURITY REVIEWS. EVEN-THOUGH THE PROJECT IS REGIONAL THERE HAS BEEN GREAT NATIONWIDE INTEREST IN THE PROJECT. THIS INDICATES THE GENERAL NEED FOR IMPROVING KNOW-HOW ON ADA BOTH AT UNIVERSITIES AND IN COMPANIES AND ORGANIZATIONS.

IN THIS FIRST PHASE OF THE STUDY WE EXPLORED THE QUESTION WHAT DO YOUNG PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ABOUT DATA WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES AND IN RELATION TO PERSONAL DATA MANAGEMENT. WE PRESENT HERE THE FINDINGS FROM A SERIES OF SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE, AGES 11 TO 18, THAT EXAMINED TEENS' PERCEPTIONS AND GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF DATA IN THEIR LIVES. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE TEENS IN THIS STUDY HAD VARYING INTERPRETATIONS OF THE NATURE OF DATA AND A BROAD UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIFECYCLE OF DATA, BUT MOST FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO CONNECT WITH DATA AT A CONCRETE AND PERSONAL LEVEL, WITH THE NOTION OF A PERSONAL DATA DOSSIER EITHER NON-EXISTENT OR ABSTRACT.
