ACCORDINGLY, THE BOOK IS SUITABLE FOR TEACHERS AND LECTURERS IN ALL EDUCATIONAL FRAMEWORKS: K-12, ACADEMIA AND INDUSTRY. THIS BOOK AIMS AT CLOSING A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN THE LITERATURE ON THE PEDAGOGY OF DATA SCIENCE. WHILE THERE ARE MANY ARTICLES AND WHITE PAPERS DEALING WITH THE CURRICULUM OF DATA SCIENCE (I.E., WHAT TO TEACH?), THE PEDAGOGICAL ASPECT OF THE FIELD (I.E., HOW TO TEACH?) IS ALMOST NEGLECTED. AT THE SAME TIME, THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PEDAGOGICAL ASPECTS OF DATA SCIENCE INCREASES AS MORE AND MORE PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY OPEN TO A VARIETY OF PEOPLE. THIS BOOK PROVIDES A VARIETY OF PEDAGOGICAL DISCUSSIONS AND SPECIFIC TEACHING METHODS AND FRAMEWORKS, AS WELL AS INCLUDES EXERCISES, AND GUIDELINES RELATED TO MANY DATA SCIENCE CONCEPTS (E.G., DATA THINKING AND THE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW), MAIN MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND CONCEPTS (E.G., KNN, SVM, NEURAL NETWORKS, PERFORMANCE METRICS, CONFUSION MATRIX, AND BIASES) AND DATA SCIENCE PROFESSIONAL TOPICS (E.G., ETHICS, SKILLS AND RESEARCH APPROACH). PROFESSOR ORIT HAZZAN IS A FACULTY MEMBER AT THE TECHNION’S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SINCE OCTOBER 2000. HER RESEARCH FOCUSES ON COMPUTER SCIENCE, SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, SHE STUDIES THE COGNITIVE AND SOCIAL PROCESSES ON THE INDIVIDUAL, THE TEAM AND THE ORGANIZATION LEVELS, IN ALL KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS. DR. KOBY MIKE IS A PH.D. GRADUATE FROM THE TECHNION'S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF PROFESSOR ORIT HAZZAN. HE CONTINUED HIS POST-DOC RESEARCH ON DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AT THE BAR-ILAN UNIVERSITY, AND OBTAINED A B.SC. AND AN M.SC.

THE PRIMARY AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND HOW DSE MAY BE SCALED TO NON-SCIENCE PARTICIPANTS, PARTICULARLY USING IMMERSIVE DSE TRAINING SESSIONS THAT CULMINATED IN A DATATHON (DATA SCIENCE HACKATHON). THE IMMERSION PROGRAMME WAS BASED ON A PROJECT-BASED PEDAGOGY INFORMED BY THE CROSS INDUSTRY STANDARD PROCESS FOR DATA MINING (CRISP-DM) TO INTEGRATE DATA SCIENCE'S MULTIDISCIPLINARY NATURE. QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH WAS USED WITH 107 DATATHON PARTICIPANTS. USING VARIOUS STATISTICAL MEASURES INCLUDING EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS, THE KEY RESULTS REVEALED THAT NON-SCIENCE PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE IMMERSIONS AND DATATHON WERE SUFFICIENTLY KNOWLEDGEABLE IN ALL THE CRISP-DM COMPONENTS AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ATTENDED THE FULL DSE PROGRAMME. THIS MEANS DATA SCIENCE SKILLS CAN BE ATTAINED BY NON-STEM INDIVIDUALS BY SPENDING FOCUSED TIME IN IMMERSIONS ON A SPECIFIC DATA SCIENCE CONCEPT. IN THIS CASE, IMMERSION SPED UP LEARNING AS THE PARTICIPANTS PICKED UP NEW DATA SCIENCE CONCEPTS WHILE APPLYING THEM SIMULTANEOUSLY.

A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH, INTEGRATING FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS AND QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEYS CONDUCTED OVER THREE ROUNDS OF DATA COLLECTION, WAS EMPLOYED. THE COLLECTED DATA UNDERWENT RIGOROUS RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY ANALYSES UTILIZING SPSS SOFTWARE. AN IMPORTANCE-PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS (IPA) WAS EXECUTED TO CONSTRUCT A PERFORMANCE CHART, EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A 24-ITEM FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO ENCOMPASS KEY ASPECTS OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. THE INITIAL INTERNAL CONSISTENCY Α COEFFICIENTS FOR QUESTIONNAIRE 2 AND QUESTIONNAIRE 3 WERE FOUND TO BE .892 AND .913, RESPECTIVELY, SURPASSING THE 0.7 THRESHOLD, INDICATING A HIGH LEVEL OF RELIABILITY FOR ALL ITEMS RELATED TO DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES. THE KAISER-MEYER-OLKIN (KMO) MEASUREMENTS APPROACHING APPROXIMATELY 0.9 AFFIRMED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE, SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO GAUGE THE RELEVANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DATA SCIENCE-RELATED INDICATORS IN THE CONTEXT OF APPLIED TALENT CULTIVATION AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY UNDERSCORES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF INDICATORS SUCH AS TEAMWORK, REGIONAL MARKET RESEARCH, AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION WITHIN THE DOMAIN OF DATA SCIENCE. IT IDENTIFIES GAPS BETWEEN KEY INDICATORS AND LOWER-PERFORMING INDICATORS, PROPOSING STRATEGIC IMPROVEMENT MEASURES TO ENHANCE THE ALIGNMENT OF APPLIED TALENT CULTIVATION OBJECTIVES WITH THE EVOLVING NEEDS OF REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY IN THE DATA SCIENCE LANDSCAPE. THE RESEARCH FINDINGS NOT ONLY CONTRIBUTE TO A FOUNDATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES IN APPLIED TALENT CULTIVATION BUT ALSO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR INNOVATIVE REFORMS IN FUTURE TALENT CULTIVATION MODELS. BY CLARIFYING OBJECTIVES AND BETTER ALIGNING THEM WITH THE DYNAMIC DEMANDS OF REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THIS STUDY SETS THE STAGE FOR TRANSFORMATIVE ADVANCEMENTS IN THE FIELD OF APPLIED TALENT CULTIVATION, PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE REALM OF DATA SCIENCE. © AUTHORS RETAIN ALL COPYRIGHTS.","APPLIED TALENT CULTIVATION; DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES; IMPORTANCE-PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS (IPA); REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT","","","","BIAN Y.

HOWEVER, IN CONVENTIONAL EDUCATION SYSTEMS, COMPUTING & QUANTITATIVE, AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS ARE OFTEN TAUGHT IN DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES. DATA STORYTELLING IS CONSTRUCTING AND PRESENTING DATA STORIES TO HIGHLIGHT THE ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS TO ACHIEVE THE COMMUNICATION GOALS TO A SPECIFIC AUDIENCE. DIGITAL DATA STORYTELLING LEVERAGES DIGITAL STORYTELLING TECHNIQUES AND BEST PRACTICES IN COMMUNICATION TO DELIVER STORIES THAT CAN BE SHARED IN DIGITAL FORMATS TO A WIDE AUDIENCE. IN THIS PAPER, WE DESCRIBE AND REFLECT ON A SEMESTER-LONG PROJECT-BASED LEARNING PILOT USING DIGITAL STORYTELLING AS A FRAMEWORK TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO EXPLORE TOPICS THEMED AROUND HUMAN FLOURISHING AND SUSTAINABILITY WITH THE END GOAL OF CONSTRUCTING DATA STORIES DELIVERED IN DIGITAL OR VIDEO FORMAT (I.E., DIGITAL DATA STORYTELLING). THE PILOT WORK WAS CONDUCTED IN AN INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE COURSE AT A 4-YEAR MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTION IN COLLABORATION WITH STUDENTS STUDYING NON-STEM DISCIPLINES AT A PARTNER COMMUNITY COLLEGE. OUR PILOT DEMONSTRATES THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF THIS SUSTAINABILITY-AWARE PROJECT-BASED LEARNING DESIGN IN RAISING STUDENTS’ AWARENESS OF SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES, INCREASING CONFIDENCE IN CROSS-DISCIPLINARY COMMUNICATION COMPETENCY, AND AT THE SAME TIME DEEPENING THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF DATA SCIENCE CONCEPTS. WE FURTHER REFLECT ON THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM MODEL AS WELL AS CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUILDING TRANSDISCIPLINARY COMMUNICATION COMPETENCY TO PREPARE FOR A DIVERSE DATA SCIENCE WORKFORCE. © 2023, AALBORG UNIVERSITY PRESS.

IN THIS STUDY, WE ASCERTAINED THE IMPACT OF DATA SCIENCE AND AI EDUCATION ON LEARNERS’ MOTIVATION AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT BY ANALYZING A LECTURE-STYLE COURSE OFFERED AS PART OF MATHEMATICAL AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AT TOKYO CITY UNIVERSITY, JAPAN. THE COURSE ANALYZED WAS DATA SCIENCE LITERACY 1 (DS1). THE ANALYSIS PERIOD SPANNED THREE ACADEMIC YEARS, FROM 2020 TO 2022. THE ANALYZED ITEMS WERE THREE MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS DERIVED FROM EXPECTANCY-VALUE THEORY, NAMELY INTRINSIC VALUE, ATTAINMENT UTILITY VALUE, AND EXPECTATIONS FOR SUCCESS. A FOURTH FACTOR, CAREER DEVELOPMENT, WAS ALSO ANALYZED. WE COLLECTED DATA PERTAINING TO THE FOUR FACTORS, THAT IS, THE THREE ABOVE MENTIONED MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT, THROUGH QUESTIONNAIRES ADMINISTERED TO DS1 LEARNERS. REGARDING DATA ANALYSIS, LEARNERS WERE CLAS-SIFIED ACCORDING TO THE VALUES (HIGH VS. LOW) THEY REPORTED FOR EACH OF THE FOUR FACTORS OF INTEREST AT THE BEGINNING OF THE COURSE. THESE WERE COMPARED TO THE VALUES REPORTED AT THE END OF THE COURSE. RESULTS SHOWED INCREASES IN ALL THE MOTIVATION FACTORS. THE INCREASING TREND WAS PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED AMONG LEARNERS WHO INITIALLY REPORTED LOW VALUES. ALTHOUGH TRENDS DIFFERED FROM YEAR TO YEAR, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DATA SCIENCE AND AI EDUCATION CAN POSITIVELY IMPACT MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS AND RELATED CAREER DEVELOPMENT. © 2023, ICIC INTERNATIONAL.

IT IS VITAL TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE NECESSARY LEARNING RESOURCES. WHILE GENDER BIAS IN STEM HAS RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION, RESEARCH ON RACIAL BIAS IS RELATIVELY LIMITED, AND THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF GENDER AND RACIAL BIASES IN DATA SCIENCE REMAIN LARGELY UNEXPLORED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THESE BIASES IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION BY EXAMINING THE PREFERENCES OF 300 DIVERSE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN DATA SCIENCE RELATED CLASSES, WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THEIR PREFERENCES REGARDING TEACHING PRACTICES AND METHODS. THE IMPACT OF RACE AND GENDER IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IS AN IMPORTANT AREA OF STUDY THAT HAS GAINED INCREASED ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS. RACE AND GENDER PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN REPRESENTATION WITHIN THE DATA SCIENCE COMMUNITY. STEREOTYPES AND BIASES CAN INFLUENCE THE EXPERIENCES OF INDIVIDUALS FROM DIFFERENT RACIAL AND GENDER BACKGROUNDS WITHIN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. RACE AND GENDER CAN IMPACT DATA SCIENCE PEDAGOGY IN VARIOUS WAYS, INFLUENCING INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES, CONTENT DELIVERY, AND STUDENT EXPERIENCES. USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO UNDERSTAND BIASED PEDAGOGY IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION CAN BE A VALUABLE APPROACH TO UNCOVER PATTERNS AND INSIGHTS. WE PROPOSE AN EFFECTIVE UNSUPERVISED LEARNING APPROACH TO EXAMINE THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN PREFERRED PEDAGOGICAL METHODS AND GENDER-RACIAL BACKGROUND OF THE PARTICIPATING STUDENTS. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT STUDENT'S GENDER HAS A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WITH LEARNING STYLE; E.G., FEMALE STUDENTS PREFER MORE PRIVATE METHODS OF INTERACTION WITH TAS AND INSTRUCTORS, SUCH AS ANONYMOUS POLLS AND ZOOM MEETINGS. FURTHERMORE, OUR STUDY UNCOVERS SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN RACE, GENDER, AND LEARNING STYLES, SHOWING THAT ASIAN STUDENTS EXHIBIT HIGHER LEVELS OF CLASSROOM INTERACTION AND GROUP ASSIGNMENT PREFERENCE THAN THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. THESE FINDINGS ARE CRUCIAL FOR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATORS SEEKING TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS RACIAL AND GENDER BIASES, PROMOTING A MORE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY FOR UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES. RECOGNIZING THESE INFLUENCES ENABLES EDUCATORS TO IMPLEMENT TARGETED STRATEGIES FOR A SUPPORTIVE AND ENGAGING EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE FOR ALL STUDENTS. © 2023 IEEE.","","ASSOCIATION REACTIONS; COMPUTER AIDED INSTRUCTION; DATA SCIENCE; LEARNING SYSTEMS; COMBINED EFFECT; GENDER BIAS; GENDER EQUITY; GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES; LEARNING RESOURCE; LEARNINGSTYLES; RACIAL BIAS; SCIENCE EDUCATION; STEM FIELDS; TEACHING PRACTICES; STUDENTS","","","ARGYRIOU P., BENAMAR K., NIKOLAJEVA M., WHAT TO BLEND?

THEN, WE PERFORM PROMPT ENGINEERING ON THE ASSIGNMENTS FOR WHICH CHATGPT HAD LOW PERFORMANCE. WE FIND THAT THE FOLLOWING PROMPT ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED CHATGPT'S PERFORMANCE: BREAKING DOWN ABSTRACT QUESTIONS INTO STEPS, BREAKING DOWN STEPS INTO MULTIPLE PROMPTS, PROVIDING DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DATASET(S), INCLUDING ALGORITHMIC DETAILS, ADDING SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS TO ENTICE SPECIFIC ACTIONS, AND REMOVING EXTRANEOUS INFORMATION.

THE EXCLUSIONARY NATURE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THREATENS EQUITY AND THE FUTURE OF INNOVATION BY LEAVING PEOPLE OUT OF THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS WHILE OVER-AMPLIFYING THE VOICES OF A SMALL GROUP WHO HAVE RESOURCES.

IN COLLABORATION WITH 17 EXPERTS, SELECTED THROUGH PURPOSIVE SAMPLING, AND INVOLVING 100 INSTRUCTORS WITHIN SICHUAN, CHINA, THIS RESEARCH EXPLORES AN INSTRUCTIONAL MODEL DESIGNED TO FOSTER SELF-REGULATED LEARNING IN THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE. THE DELPHI DATA COLLECTION METHOD IS EMPLOYED TO INVESTIGATE THE RELEVANCE OF VARIOUS LEARNING THEORIES WITHIN INTERNATIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION IN SICHUAN PROVINCE, CHINA, WITH A SPECIFIC EMPHASIS ON THE DATA SCIENCE DISCIPLINE. THE SELF-REGULATED LEARNING IN INTERNATIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION (SLR-IHE) MODEL, INFORMED BY SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRES, ADDRESSES PERTINENT CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, INCLUDING ISSUES RELATED TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY, FACULTY TRAINING, CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT, FACULTY MOBILITY, CROSS-BORDER REGULATIONS, AND FUNDING CONSTRAINTS. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION (IHE) MODEL FOR SICHUAN PROVINCE, CHINA, USING THE DELPHI TECHNIQUE, WHICH CONSISTS OF FOUR DISTINCT INSTRUCTIONAL MODULES. THROUGH A LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF THE SLR-IHE MODEL, IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT THE SELF-REGULATED LEARNING PROCESS IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION COMPRISES FOUR ESSENTIAL STAGES, EACH CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACQUISITION OF DISTINCT GOALS. THESE STAGES INCLUDE: (1) ACTIVATING PRIOR KNOWLEDGE; (2) FOSTERING IDEA EXCHANGE AND ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENT; (3) BUILDING ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE THROUGH UNDERSTANDING, MEMORIZATION, ANALYSIS, AND TRANSFER; AND (4) GENERATING INNOVATIVE IDEAS THROUGH REFLEXIVE THINKING AND INITIATING CREATIVE THOUGHT PROCESSES. THESE STAGES COLLECTIVELY SUPPORT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SPECIFIC GOALS ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-MANAGED LEARNING (SML), SELF-REGULATED LEARNING (SRL), SELF-PACED LEARNING (SPL), AND SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING (SDL) IN THE CONTEXT OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. THIS COMPREHENSIVE INSTRUCTIONAL MODEL FOR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT IN SICHUAN PROVINCE, CHINA, EMPHASIZES GLOBALIZATION, COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH AS KEY DRIVERS FOR ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION IN THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE. © 2023, BRIGHT PUBLISHER.

GIVEN THAT EDUCATIONAL DESIGNERS OFTEN PRIVILEGE AUTHENTICITY, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE HOW TEACHERS USE FEATURES OF DATA SETS TO DETERMINE THEIR SUITABILITY FOR AUTHENTIC DATA SCIENCE LEARNING EXPERIENCES WITH THEIR STUDENTS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: INTERVIEWS WITH 12 PRACTICING HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS TEACHERS WERE CONDUCTED AND VIDEO-RECORDED. TEACHERS WERE GIVEN TWO DIFFERENT DATA SETS ABOUT THE SAME CONTEXT AND ASKED TO EXPLAIN WHICH ONE WOULD BE BETTER SUITED FOR AN AUTHENTIC DATA SCIENCE EXPERIENCE. FOLLOWING KNOWLEDGE ANALYSIS METHODS, THE TEACHERS’ RESPONSES WERE CODED AND ITERATIVELY REVIEWED TO FIND THEMES THAT APPEARED ACROSS MULTIPLE TEACHERS RELATED TO THEIR AESTHETIC JUDGMENTS. FINDINGS: THREE ASPECTS OF AUTHENTICITY FOR DATA SETS FOR THIS TASK WERE IDENTIFIED. THESE INCLUDE THINKING OF AUTHENTIC DATA SETS AS BEING “MESSY,” AS REQUIRING MORE WORK FOR THE STUDENT OR ANALYST TO PORE THROUGH THAN OTHER DATA SETS AND AS INVOLVING COMPUTATION.

IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATE HOW FEEDBACK IN A LARGE-SCALE ITS CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED IN A DATA-DRIVEN WAY, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY HOW PERSONALIZATION OF FEEDBACK CAN LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN STUDENT PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES. FIRST, IN THIS PAPER WE PROPOSE A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO GENERATE PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK IN AN AUTOMATED WAY, WHICH TAKES INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF STUDENTS INTO ACCOUNT, WHILE ALLEVIATING THE NEED OF EXPERT INTERVENTION AND DESIGN OF HAND-CRAFTED RULES. WE LEVERAGE STATE-OF-THE-ART MACHINE LEARNING AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK USING HINTS AND WIKIPEDIA-BASED EXPLANATIONS. SECOND, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK LEADS TO IMPROVED SUCCESS RATES AT SOLVING EXERCISES IN PRACTICE: OUR PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK MODEL IS USED IN KORBIT, A LARGE-SCALE DIALOGUE-BASED ITS WITH AROUND 20,000 STUDENTS LAUNCHED IN 2019.

THUS, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO REVEAL THE REALITY OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND TO DETERMINE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR TEACHING DATA SCIENCE IN THE REGION. THIRTEEN COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST WERE OFFERING 48 DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMES AT THE TIME OF THE STUDY. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT THESE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMES SIGNIFICANTLY USE THE WORDS ‘DATA’ AND ‘ANALYTICS’ IN THEIR NAMES. WITH REGARD TO THE ACADEMIC AFFILIATIONS OF THE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMES, THE STUDY FOUND THAT THEY ARE OFFERED IN A VARIETY OF SCHOOLS, ESPECIALLY COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS. MOREOVER, THE STUDY FOUND THAT COMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE DOMINANT TREND IN THE PROGRAMMES. DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP WITH OTHER PROGRAMMES, ESPECIALLY STATISTICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE, BECAUSE OF THE INTERDISCIPLINARY NATURE OF THIS FIELD. DATA SCIENCE SCHOOLS IN THE MIDDLE EAST DIFFER IN TERMS OF THEIR PROGRAMME TITLES, PROGRAMME DESCRIPTIONS, COURSE CATALOGUES, CURRICULUM STRUCTURES AND COURSE OBJECTIVES.

FOR EXAMPLE, TEACHERS EXPECT A PLATFORM WHERE THEY CAN EASILY DISTRIBUTE AND GRADE PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS, AND STUDENTS WANT TO QUICKLY START CODING AND TRAINING MODELS WITHOUT THE BURDEN OF SETTING UP AN ENVIRONMENT. TO THIS END, WE DEVELOP MLADDER, AN ONLINE TRAINING SYSTEM FOR MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. SPECIFICALLY, WE SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATE TWO OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE, CODALAB AND JUPYTER NOTEBOOK, WHICH ARE USED FOR HOSTING ASSIGNMENTS AND BUILDING MODELS, RESPECTIVELY.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH THAT USES A DATA SCIENCE FRAMEWORK THE RESEARCH TEAM DEVELOPED TO ASSIST TEACHERS IN PROVIDING DATA SCIENCE INSTRUCTION TO ELEMENTARY-AGED STUDENTS. USING PHENOMENOLOGICAL CASE STUDY METHODOLOGY, THE AUTHORS USE CLASSROOM OBSERVATIONS, STUDENT FOCUS GROUPS, VIDEO RECORDINGS AND ARTIFACTS TO DETAIL WAYS LEARNERS ENGAGE IN DATA SCIENCE PRACTICES AND UNDERSTAND HOW THEY PERCEIVE THEIR ENGAGEMENT DURING ACTIVITIES AND LEARNING. FINDINGS: FINDINGS SUGGEST STUDENT ENGAGEMENT IN DATA SCIENCE IS ENHANCED WHEN DATA PROBLEMS ARE CONTEXTUALIZED AND CONNECTED TO STUDENTS’ LIVED EXPERIENCES; DATA ANALYSIS AND DATA-BASED DECISION-MAKING IS PRACTICED IN MULTIPLE WAYS; AND STUDENTS ARE GIVEN CHOICES TO COMMUNICATE PATTERNS, INTERPRET GRAPHS AND TELL DATA STORIES. THE AUTHORS NOTE CHALLENGES STUDENTS EXPERIENCED WITH DATA PRACTICES INCLUDING CONFLICT BETWEEN INCONSISTENCIES IN DATA PATTERNS AND LIVED EXPERIENCES AND FOCUSING ON DATA VISUALIZATION APPEARANCES VERSUS RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIABLES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: DATA SCIENCE INSTRUCTION IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IS AN UNDERSTUDIED, EMERGING AND IMPORTANT AREA OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. MOST ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OFFER LIMITED DATA SCIENCE INSTRUCTION; FEW ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OFFER DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM WITH EMBEDDED CT PRACTICES INTEGRATED ACROSS DISCIPLINES.

OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES, THE WORLD'S RELIANCE ON CLOUD COMPUTING AND BIG DATA WILL CONTINUOUSLY INCREASE, AND NEW DATA-CENTRIC TECHNOLOGIES AND ENGINEERING APPROACHES WILL BE DEVELOPED. DUE TO THIS RAPIDLY DEVELOPING FIELD, THERE IS A NEED TO TRACK THESE TRENDS AND INCORPORATE THE CORRESPONDING DEVELOPMENTS INTO OUR CURRENT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CURRICULUM. BESIDES DATA SCIENCE SKILLS ALREADY TAUGHT IN TRADITIONAL ENGINEERING CURRICULA, SUCH AS MATHEMATICAL, COMPUTATIONAL, AND STATISTICAL FOUNDATIONS, THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES GUIDE DISCUSSES THAT KEY CONCEPTS IN DEVELOPING DATA ACUMEN INCLUDE DOMAIN-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS AND ETHICAL PROBLEM-SOLVING. THIS WORK-IN-PROGRESS (WIP) PAPER WILL HIGHLIGHT THE FOUNDATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY TO EXPLORE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IN TWO DOMAIN-SPECIFIC PROGRAMS: MATERIAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING. THIS PROJECT IS BROKEN DOWN INTO THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: 1) FACILITATE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR ENGINEERING AND RELATED TOPICS, 2) PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES WHERE THEY CAN LEARN NEW SKILLS THROUGH OPPORTUNITIES IN NEW SETTINGS TO TRANSFORM DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, AND 3) EXPAND THE DATA SCIENCE TALENT POOL BY ENABLING THE PARTICIPATION OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS, EXPERIENCES, SKILLS, AND TECHNICAL MATURITY. THE PAPER WILL FOCUS ON THE TOPICS, DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES WITHIN COURSES AND CURRICULA, ESTABLISHING DATA SETS, REPRESENTATIVE EXAMPLES OF WORK-IN-PROGRESS EFFORTS AND THEIR SUCCESS. © AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR ENGINEERING EDUCATION, 2023.","CONTEXTUALIZED LEARNING; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; MODULAR COURSE MATERIALS; WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT","DATA SCIENCE; ENGINEERING EDUCATION; PERSONNEL; STUDENTS; CONTEXTUALIZED LEARNING; COURSE MATERIAL; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; DOMAIN SPECIFIC; ENGINEERING CURRICULUM; MODULAR COURSE MATERIAL; MODULARS; SCIENCE EDUCATION; UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS; WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT; CURRICULA","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, (IIS-2123343)","THIS MATERIAL IS BASED UPON WORK SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION UNDER GRANT IIS-2123343.

ONE COMPLEX TRANSFORMATION IS THE PIVOT TRANSFORMATION, WHICH REORGANIZES A TABLE BASED ON AGGREGATION AND SUMMARIZING ALONG SELECTED COLUMNS AND ROWS. CURRENT ASSESSMENTS TEST STUDENT UNDERSTANDING IN STATIC SCENARIOS. THUS, THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP STUDENTS EXPLICITLY WORK THROUGH THE STEPS AND VARIABLES NEEDED TO EXPRESS A PIVOT TRANSFORMATION IN A RANDOMIZABLE MANNER. AS SUCH, WE EXPLORE WHETHER A DYNAMIC DIGITAL ASSESSMENT FOR THE PIVOT TRANSFORMATION CAN EFFECTIVELY ACHIEVE MASTERY LEARNING TOWARDS THIS SKILL. OUR DESIGN IS INSPIRED BY PARSONS PROBLEMS, IN WHICH ANSWER COMPONENTS (PIVOT TABLE OUTPUT LABELS AND VALUES) CAN BE COMPOSED INTO THE OUTPUT OF A PIVOT TRANSFORMATION. A QUESTION CAN BE DERIVED FROM A SMALL RANDOMIZED DATASET, AND RANDOMIZED PANDAS CODE THAT OPERATES UPON THE DATASET AND CAN BE AUTOGRADED.

YET, LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT THE PEDAGOGICAL PRACTICES AND TOOLS EMPLOYED IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW, WE SUMMARIZE PRIOR PEDAGOGICAL PRACTICES AND TOOLS USED IN DATA SCIENCE INITIATIVES AT THE HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL. FOLLOWING THE TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (TPACK) FRAMEWORK, WE AIM TO CHARACTERIZE THE TECHNOLOGICAL AND PEDAGOGICAL KNOWLEDGE QUALITY OF REVIEWED STUDIES, AS WE FIND THE CONTENT PRESENTED TO BE DIVERSE AND INCOMPARABLE. TPACK IS A UNIVERSALLY ESTABLISHED METHOD FOR TEACHING CONSIDERING INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY. YET IT IS SELDOM USED FOR THE ANALYSIS OF DATA SCIENCE PEDAGOGY. TO MAKE THIS FRAMEWORK MORE STRUCTURED, WE LIST THE TOOLS EMPLOYED IN EACH REVIEWED STUDY TO SUMMARIZE TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE QUALITY. WE FURTHER EXAMINE WHETHER EACH STUDY FOLLOWS THE NEEDS OF THE COGNITIVE APPRENTICESHIP THEORY TO SUMMARIZE THE PEDAGOGICAL KNOWLEDGE QUALITY IN EACH REVIEWED STUDY. OF THE 23 REVIEWED STUDIES, 14 MET THE NEEDS OF COGNITIVE APPRENTICESHIP THEORY AND INCLUDE HANDS-ON EXPERIENCES, PROMOTE STUDENTS’ ACTIVE LEARNING, SEEKING GUIDANCE FROM THE INSTRUCTOR AS A COACH, INTRODUCE STUDENTS TO THE REAL-WORLD INDUSTRY DEMANDS OF DATA AND DATA SCIENTISTS, AND PROVIDE MEANINGFUL LEARNING RESOURCES AND FEEDBACK ACROSS VARIOUS STAGES OF THEIR DATA SCIENCE INITIATIVES. WHILE EACH STUDY PRESENTS AT LEAST ONE TOOL TO TEACH DATA SCIENCE, WE FOUND THE ASSESSMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE OF DATA SCIENCE INITIATIVES TO BE DIFFICULT. THIS IS BECAUSE THE STUDIES FALL SHORT OF EXPLAINING HOW STUDENTS COME TO LEARN THE OPERATION OF TOOLS AND BECOME PROFICIENT IN USING THEM THROUGHOUT A COURSE OR PROGRAM.

TO ILLUSTRATE THIS ARGUMENT, WE EXPLORE THE PRODUCTION OF VISUALITY WITHIN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AS ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW THE VISUAL MANIFESTS WITHIN SCHOOLS. IN RESPONSE, WE PROPOSE A VISUAL LITERACY INFORMED APPROACH TO ENGAGING STUDENTS WITH DATA, ONE THAT EXPANDS BEYOND CONTEMPORARY FORMS OF CRITICAL DATA LITERACY BY INVOLVING AN ONTOLOGICAL CRITIQUE OF EDUCATIONAL AESTHETICIZATION. TO GROUND THIS WORK, WE EXAMINE THE ROLE OF VISUALITY AND AESTHETICS WITHIN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CO-DESIGNED ARTS-INFUSED DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS IN FOUR US MIDDLE SCHOOLS. IN ANALYZING INTERVIEWS WITH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS, WE UNCOVER A SERIES OF TENSIONS THAT REVEAL THE ONGOING INFLUENCE OF SCHOOL VISUALITIES ALONGSIDE THE POTENTIAL FOR STUDENT GENERATED IMAGES TO AMPLIFY THEIR RIGHT TO LOOK.

HOWEVER, THERE ARE TWO ISSUES WITH THIS APPROACH: (1) IT IS VERY COSTLY TO PREPARE MULTIPLE REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS (USING REAL DATA) ACCORDING TO THE LEARNING OBJECTIVES, AND (2) THE LEARNER MUST SUDDENLY TACKLE COMPLEX REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEARNING FROM A TEXTBOOK USING IDEAL DATA. TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES, THIS PAPER PROPOSES DATA SCIENCE TEACHING MATERIAL THAT USES AGENT-BASED SIMULATION (ABS). THE PROPOSED TEACHING MATERIAL CONSISTS OF AN ABS MODEL AND AN ABS STORY. TO SOLVE ISSUE 1, THE SCENARIO OF THE PROBLEM CAN BE CHANGED ACCORDING TO THE LEARNING OBJECTIVES BY SETTING THE APPROPRIATE PARAMETERS OF THE ABS MODEL. TO SOLVE ISSUE 2, THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL OF THE TASKS CAN BE ADJUSTED BY CHANGING THE DESCRIPTION IN THE ABS STORY. WE SHOW THAT, BY USING THIS TEACHING MATERIAL, THE LEARNER CAN SIMULATE THE TYPICAL TASKS PERFORMED BY A DATA SCIENTIST IN A STEP-BY-STEP MANNER (CAUSAL INFERENCE, DATA UNDERSTANDING, HYPOTHESIS BUILDING, DATA COLLECTION, DATA WRANGLING, DATA ANALYSIS, AND HYPOTHESIS TESTING). THE TEACHING MATERIAL DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON CAUSAL INFERENCE AS THE LEARNING OBJECTIVES AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES AS THE MODEL THEME FOR ABS, BUT ABS IS USED AS A MODEL TO REPRODUCE MANY TYPES OF SOCIAL PHENOMENA, AND ITS RANGE OF EXPRESSION IS EXTREMELY WIDE. THEREFORE, WE EXPECT THAT THE PROPOSED TEACHING MATERIAL WILL INSPIRE THE CONSTRUCTION OF TEACHING MATERIAL FOR VARIOUS OBJECTIVES IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION.  © 2023 IEEE.","AGENT-BASED SIMULATION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; COVID-19; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION","DATA ACQUISITION; DATA SCIENCE; LEARNING SYSTEMS; AGENT BASED SIMULATION; AGENT-BASED SIMULATION MODELS; CAUSAL INFERENCES; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; DATA UNDERSTANDING; LEARNING OBJECTIVES; REAL-WORLD PROBLEM; SCIENCE EDUCATION; SCIENCE TEACHING; TEACHING MATERIALS; COVID-19","JAPAN SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCE, JSPS, (22K13785)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT WE THANK EDANZ (HTTPS://JP.EDANZ.COM/AC) FOR EDITING A DRAFT OF THIS MANUSCRIPT.

DATA FEMINISM IS AN APPROACH THAT DRAWS ON FEMINIST SCHOLARSHIP AND ACTION TO HUMANIZE DATA AND CONTEND WITH THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DATA AND POWER. IN THIS REVIEW PAPER, WE DRAW ON PRINCIPLES FROM DATA FEMINISM TO REVIEW 42 DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND DESIGN APPROACHES THAT ENGAGE YOUTH WITH DATA, MANY OF WHICH ARE EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY INTENSIVE AND BEAR ON FUTURE DATA-INTENSIVE EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DESIGN PROJECTS. WE DESCRIBE HOW THE PROJECTS ENGAGE STUDENTS WITH EXAMINING POWER, CHALLENGING POWER, ELEVATING EMOTION AND LIVED EXPERIENCE, RETHINKING BINARIES AND HIERARCHIES, EMBRACING PLURALISM, CONSIDERING CONTEXT, AND MAKING LABOUR VISIBLE. IN DOING SO, WE ARTICULATE WAYS THAT CURRENT DATA EDUCATION INITIATIVES INVOLVE YOUTH IN THINKING ABOUT ISSUES OF JUSTICE AND INCLUSION. THESE PROJECTS MAY OFFER EXAMPLES OF VARYING COMPLEXITY FOR FUTURE WORK TO CONTEND WITH AND, IDEALLY, EXTEND IN ORDER TO FURTHER REALIZE DATA FEMINISM IN K-12 DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. PRACTITIONER NOTES WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC DATA FEMINISM IS AN EMERGENT FRAMEWORK FOR CHANGING DATA PRACTICES AND DISCOURSE IN SERVICE OF EQUITY AND JUSTICE. DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IS RAPIDLY GROWING AS A TOPIC OF INTEREST IN THE EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DESIGN COMMUNITIES. MANY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN PROJECTS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED AND SHARED IN PUBLICATIONS THAT PRECEDED THE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION OF THE DATA FEMINISM FRAMEWORK. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS DATA FEMINISM IS PARTIALLY RE-ARTICULATED IN TERMS FAMILIAR TO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH COMMUNITIES. PRIOR AND RECENT PROJECTS ARE ORGANIZED WITH RESPECT TO HOW THEY ILLUSTRATE POTENTIAL CONNECTIONS TO CORE DATA FEMINISM PRINCIPLES. THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES SPECIFIC STRATEGIES THAT RECENT PROJECTS HAVE USED THAT HAVE POTENTIAL FOR REALIZING DATA FEMINISM PRINCIPLES. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND/OR POLICY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGISTS CAN USE THE RE-ARTICULATED PRINCIPLES OF DATA FEMINISM FOR EDUCATION TO INFORM THEIR FUTURE DESIGN WORK. TRACTABLE STEPS TO ACHIEVE DATA JUSTICE THAT ARE ATTAINABLE WITHIN EXISTING EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS CAN BE PURSUED. COMMUNITIES CAN AND SHOULD BRING TOGETHER MULTIPLE WAYS OF KNOWING TO SUPPORT NEW EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES AND FUTURES WITH DATA. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.

THIS INTERPRETIVE STUDY EXAMINED MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS' UNDERSTANDING OF STATISTICAL CONCEPTS INVOLVED IN MAKING A PLAN TO COLLECT DATA TO ANSWER A STATISTICAL QUESTION WITHIN A SOCIAL ISSUE CONTEXT USING DATA AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET. STUDENT ARTIFACTS, RESEARCHER NOTES, AND AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDINGS FROM NINE GROUPS OF 20 SEVENTH-GRADE STUDENTS IN TWO GIFTED EDUCATION PULL-OUT CLASSES AT A SUBURBAN MIDDLE SCHOOL WERE USED TO ANSWER THE STUDY RESEARCH QUESTIONS.

BACKGROUND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED APPRECIATION OF DATA AS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY STRATEGIC RESOURCE. THIS HAS RESULTED IN A GREATER NEED FOR SKILLS IN DATA SCIENCE TO EXTRACT MEANINGFUL INSIGHTS FROM DATA. HOWEVER, THE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR DATA SCIENCE SKILLS. WHILE THERE IS GROWTH IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS, THEY APPEAR MORE AS A REBRANDING OF EXISTING ENGINEERING, COMPUTER SCIENCE, MATHEMATICS, AND STATISTICS PROGRAMS. METHODOLOGY A SCOPING REVIEW WAS ADOPTED FOR THE PERIOD 2010–2021 USING SIX SCHOLARLY MULTIDISCIPLINARY DATABASES: GOOGLE SCHOLAR, IEEE XPLORE, ACM DIGITAL LIBRARY, SCIENCEDIRECT, SCOPUS, AND THE AIS BASKET OF EIGHT JOURNALS. THE STUDY WAS NARROWED DOWN TO 91 RESEARCH ARTICLES AND ADOPTED A CLASSIFICATION CODING FRAMEWORK AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS FOR ANALYSIS. CONTRIBUTION WE THEORETICALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWING BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE NEED TO SCALE UP DATA SCIENCE THROUGH MULTIDISCIPLINARY PEDAGOGIES AND DISCIPLINES AS THE DEMAND GROWS. THIS PAVES THE WAY FOR FUTURE RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND WHICH PROGRAMS CAN PROVIDE CURRENT AND FUTURE DATA SCIENTISTS THE SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES RELEVANT TO SOCIETAL NEEDS. FINDINGS THE KEY RESULTS REVEALED THE LIMITED EMPHASIS ON DSE, ESPECIALLY IN NON-STEM (SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS) DISCIPLINES. IN ADDITION, THE RESULTS IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO FIND A SUITABLE PEDAGOGY OR A SET OF PEDAGOGIES BECAUSE OF THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY NATURE OF DSE. FURTHER, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO EXISTING FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF DSE AT VARIOUS EDUCATION LEVELS, LEADING TO SOMETIMES INADEQUATE PROGRAMS. THE STUDY ALSO NOTED THE IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS DSE AND THUS CREATE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE DSE ECOSYSTEM. MOST OF THE RESEARCH STUDIES REVIEWED WERE CASE STUDIES THAT PRESENTED MORE STEM PROGRAMS AS COMPARED TO NON-STEM. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS WE RECOMMEND CROSS INDUSTRY STANDARD PROCESS FOR DATA MINING (CRISP-DM) AS A FRAMEWORK TO ADOPT COLLABORATIVE PEDAGOGIES TO TEACH DATA SCIENCE. THIS RESEARCH IMPLIES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ACADEMIA, POLICYMAKERS, AND DATA SCIENCE CONTENT DEVELOPERS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH ORGANIZATIONS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCHERS WE RECOMMEND FUTURE RESEARCH INTO PROGRAMS THAT CAN PROVIDE CURRENT AND FUTURE DATA SCIENTISTS THE SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES RELEVANT TO SOCIETAL NEEDS AND HOW INTERDISCIPLINARITY WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE INTEGRATED. IMPACT ON SOCIETY DATA SCIENCE EXPERTISE IS ESSENTIAL FOR TACKLING SOCIETAL ISSUES AND GENERATING BENEFICIAL EFFECTS. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT DATA IS DIVERSE AND ALWAYS CHANGING, NECESSITATING ONGOING (UP)SKILLING. ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS MUST THEREFORE STAY CURRENT WITH NEW ADVANCES, CHANGING DATA, AND ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. INDUSTRY EXPERTS MIGHT SHARE VIEWS BASED ON THEIR PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE. THE DSE ECOSYSTEM CAN BE SHAPED BY COLLABORATING WITH NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS AND BEING AWARE OF EACH STAKEHOLDER’S FUNCTION IN ORDER TO ADVANCE DATA SCIENCE INTERNATIONALLY. FUTURE RESEARCH THE STUDY FOUND THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES THAT CAN BE EXPLORED TO IMPROVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DSE, FOR INSTANCE, HOW CAN CRISP-DM BE INTEGRATED INTO COLLABORATIVE PEDAGOGIES TO PROVIDE A FULLY COMPREHENSIVE DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM? © (CC BY-NC 4.0) THIS ARTICLE IS LICENSED TO YOU UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NONCOMMERCIAL 4.0 INTERNATIONAL LICENSE.","DATA SCIENCE APPLICATIONS IN EDUCATION; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; PEDAGOGY; TEACHING/LEARNING STRATEGIES; TRANSDISCIPLINARY PROJECTS","","EUROPEAN COMMISSION, EC; DEUTSCHE TELEKOM STIFTUNG","FIRST, PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS BENEFIT FROM THE TEACHING AND LEARNING FUNDING MODEL TO SUPPORT DSE THROUGH SOURCING QUALIFIED LECTURERS AND CONDUCTING RESEARCH RELATED TO DATA SCIENCE AND DSE.

ALTHOUGH THE REPRESENTATIONAL FORMS CHOSEN BY STUDENTS WERE MAINLY TRADITIONAL, OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THEY WERE ENGAGED IN AUTHENTIC DATA VISUALIZATION PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THEIR PROGRAMMING PROCESS. THESE PRACTICES INCLUDED TRANSLATING IDEAS INTO PROGRAMS, SELECTING PARAMETERS (SUCH AS COLOR SCHEME AND SPACE BETWEEN DATA POINTS), INSPECTING THE OUTPUT, AND ADDING ANNOTATIONS TO PROVIDE CONTEXT AND BETTER COMMUNICATE THE DESIRED INFORMATION.

HOWEVER, IT REMAINS UNCERTAIN WHETHER THE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS PROVIDED BY UNIVERSITIES WITH DIFFERENT RANKINGS DELIVER SIMILAR OR DISTINCT DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES. THIS STUDY AIMS TO COMPARE THE COMPETENCIES OF GRADUATE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS OFFERED IN THE UNITED STATES. IT ADDRESSED THE RESEARCH QUESTION OF 'ARE THERE ANY DIFFERENCES IN GRADUATE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAM COMPETENCIES BASED ON THEIR UNIVERSITY RANKINGS?' THE PROGRAM COMPETENCIES OF 228 DATA SCIENCE GRADUATE PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THEIR U.S. NEWS UNIVERSITY RANKINGS WERE COLLECTED AND COMPARED. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT REGARDLESS OF THEIR NATIONAL RANKINGS, ALL UNIVERSITIES OFFER MOST OF THE COMPETENCIES REQUIRED FOR DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS, EXCEPT FOR MACHINE LEARNING AND SENSOR NETWORKS. FORTY-SIX PERCENT OF DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED IN UNIVERSITIES THAT HOLD NATIONAL RANKINGS WITHIN THE TOP 75, FOCUSING ON MAJORS SUCH AS DATA SCIENCE AND BUSINESS ANALYTICS. FURTHERMORE, THE TOP-RANKED UNIVERSITIES PROVIDE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL DEPARTMENTS OR SCHOOLS, WITH THE MOST PROMINENT ONES BEING BUSINESS, COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, AND MATH/STATISTICS. THE PRIMARY RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION OF THIS STUDY REVOLVES AROUND CONDUCTING A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF DATA SCIENCE PROGRAM COMPETENCIES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS HAVE SIGNIFICANT RELEVANCE TO COMPUTING EDUCATION. THE STUDY PROVIDES VALUABLE GUIDELINES FOR EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES IN THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE: 1) NAMING THE NEW MAJORS AS EITHER 'DATA SCIENCE' OR 'BUSINESS ANALYTICS'; 2) HOUSING THE NEW DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS WITHIN EXISTING DEPARTMENTS OR SCHOOLS SPECIALIZING IN BUSINESS, COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, AND MATH/STATISTICS; 3) INCORPORATING ALL ACM DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES INTO THE CURRICULUM OF THESE PROGRAMS WHILE ALSO EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR A STRONG FOUNDATION IN MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS. OVERALL, THESE IMPLICATIONS PROVIDE VALUABLE GUIDANCE FOR UNIVERSITIES SEEKING TO DEVELOP IMPACTFUL AND WELL-ROUNDED DATA SCIENCE EDUCATIONAL OFFERINGS THAT ALIGN WITH INDUSTRY DEMANDS AND EQUIP STUDENTS WITH THE NECESSARY SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE. © 2023 IEEE.","ACM COMPETENCIES; COMPUTER SCIENCE; COMPUTING EDUCATION; DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCE; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; GRADUATE EDUCATION","EDUCATION COMPUTING; ENGINEERING EDUCATION; STUDENTS; ACM COMPETENCY; BUSINESS ANALYTICS; COMPUTING EDUCATION; DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCE; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; GRADUATE EDUCATION; GRADUATE PROGRAMME; SCIENCE EDUCATION; SCIENCE PROJECTS; SCIENCE TECHNOLOGIES; SENSOR NETWORKS","","","PAUL P., AITHAL P.S., COMPUTING ACADEMICS INTO NEW AGEPROGRAMS AND FIELDS: BIG DATA ANALYTICS & DATA SCIENCES IN INDIANACADEMICS-AN ACADEMIC INVESTIGATION, IRA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNALOF MANAGEMENT & SOCIAL SCIENCES, 10, PP. 107-118, (2018); ZHANG Y., WU D., HAGEN L., SONG I.Y., MOSTAFA J., OH S., ANDERSON T., DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM IN THE IFIELD, JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, (2022); SONG I.Y., ZHU Y., BIG DATA AND DATA SCIENCE: OPPORTUNITIES ANDCHALLENGES OF ISCHOOLS, JOURNAL OF DATA AND INFORMATION SCIENCE, 2, PP. 1-18, (2016); WHITE J.A., GAVER D.P., BUTERA R.J., ET AL., CORE COMPETENCIES FORUNDERGRADUATES IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING: FINDINGS, CONSEQUENCES, AND RECOMMENDATIONS, ANN BIOMED ENGVOL., 48, PP. 905-912, (2020); BUKHARI D., DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM: CURRENT SCENARIO, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA MINING & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENTPROCESS (IJDKP), 10, (2020); LI D., MILONAS E., ZHANG Q., CONTENT ANALYSIS OF DATA SCIENCE GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN THE US, 2021 ASEE VIRTUAL ANNUAL CONFERENCE CONTENT ACCESS, (2021); OVERTON M., KELEINSCHMIT S., DATA SCIENCE LITERACY: TOWARD APHILOSOPHY OF ACCESSIBLE AND ADAPTABLE DATA SCIENCE SKILL DEVELOPMENTIN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION PROGRAMS, TEACHING PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, 40, 3, PP. 354-365, (2022); DEMCHENKO Y., BELLOUM A., LOS W., WIKTORSKI T., MANIERI A., BROCKS H., BECKER J., HEUTELBECK D., HEMMJE M., BREWER S., EDISON DATA SCIENCE FRAMEWORK: A FOUNDATION FOR BUILDING DATA SCIENCE PROFESSION FOR RESEARCH AND INDUSTRY, PP. 620-626, (2016); LEIDIG P., CASSEL L., ACM TASKFORCE EFFORTS ON COMPUTINGCOMPETENCIES IN UNDERGRADUATE DATA SCIENCE CURRICULA, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 ACM CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, (2020); DE VEAUX R., AGARWAL M., AVERETT M., BAUMER B., BRAY A., BRESSOUD T., BRYANT L., CHENG L., FRANCIS A., GOULD R., KIM A., KRETCHMAR M., LU Q., MOSKOL A., NOLAN D., PELAYO R., RALEIGH S., SETHI R., SONDJAJA M., TIRUVILUAMALA N., UHLIG P., WASHINGTON T., WESLEY C., WHITE D., YE P., CURRICULUM GUIDELINES FORUNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS IN DATA SCIENCE, THE ANNUAL REVIEW OFSTATISTICS AND ITS APPLICATION, (2017)","","INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC.","ENGLISH","PROC.

EFFECTIVE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION REQUIRES A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THAT INCORPORATES THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE, PRACTICAL SKILLS, AND INDUSTRY RELEVANCE. HOWEVER, IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND APPROPRIATE TEACHING STRATEGIES AND TOOLS THAT SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ALL THESE ELEMENTS INTO THE CLASSROOM. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS A NEED TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP EFFECTIVE PEDAGOGICAL METHODS, INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES, AND TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE INSTRUCTORS TO DELIVER WELL-ROUNDED DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION THAT CATERS TO THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND PREPARES THEM FOR REAL-WORLD DATA-DRIVEN CHALLENGES. KNOWING WHICH TECHNOLOGY IS APPROPRIATE TO USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A PARTICULAR TEACHING PEDAGOGY TO DELIVER A PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEARNING MATERIAL TO DIVERSE STUDENTS IS CRUCIAL. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE HOW THE TPACK (TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE) INFLUENCES DATA SCIENCE TEACHING PRACTICES. TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE STUDY SURVEYED 26 DATA SCIENCE INSTRUCTORS TO ASSESS THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THE SEVEN TPACK CONSTRUCTS. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY SHOWED A LOW REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. THE FINDINGS ALSO SHOWED A BALANCED KNOWLEDGE BETWEEN PEDAGOGY AND TECHNOLOGICAL CONTENT, INDICATING THAT INSTRUCTORS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A COMPREHENSIVE AND ENGAGING LEARNING ENVIRONMENT THAT SUPPORTS STUDENT SUCCESS IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. DESPITE THIS POSITIVE FINDING BEING ESTABLISHED, IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHICH TECHNOLOGICAL TEACHING AND LEARNING TOOLS INSTRUCTORS ARE FAMILIAR WITH. TO THIS END, FUTURE STUDIES ARE RECOMMENDED IN THIS AREA. THE RESULTS FURTHER SHOWED THAT MODEL EVALUATION IS NOT TAUGHT AT UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL. THEREFORE, THE STUDY RECOMMENDS CONTINUOUS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR DATA SCIENCE INSTRUCTORS TO EFFECTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS TRAINING CURRENT AND FUTURE DATA SCIENTISTS. THIS IS NECESSARY SINCE TECHNOLOGIES, DATA, AND DATA SCIENCE TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES EVOLVE. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY RECOMMENDS RESEARCH BE CONDUCTED ON THE TYPE OF DATA SCIENCE FRAMEWORK REQUIRED TO GUIDE INSTRUCTORS IN TERMS OF CURRICULUM DESIGN, PEDAGOGIES, AND TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS.

IN THIS PAPER, WE DISCUSS THE CENTRALITY OF API (APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE) LOOKUP TO DATA WRAN-GLING, AND HOW AN ONTOLOGY-STRUCTURED COMMAND MENU COULD FACILITATE IT. WE DESIGN THUMBNAIL GRAPHICS AS VISUAL ALTERNATIVES TO EXPLAINING DATA WRANGLING OPERATIONS AND USE A SURVEY TO VALIDATE THEIR QUALITY. WE FURTHERMORE PREDICT THAT THUMBNAIL GRAPHICS MAKE THE MENU MORE NAVIGABLE, IMPROVING LOOKUP E_CIENCY AND PERFORMANCE. OUR PREDICTIONS ARE TESTED USING SLICE N DICE, AN ONLINE DATA WRANGLING TUTORIAL PLATFORM THAT COLLECTS LEARNER ACTIVITY. IT INCLUDES BOTH NON-PROGRAMMATIC AND PROGRAMMATIC DATA WRANGLING EXERCISES. PARTICIPANTS FROM A MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL SAMPLE (N=200) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED THE TUTORIAL EITHER WITH OR WITHOUT THUMBNAIL GRAPHICS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THUMBNAIL GRAPHICS REDUCE THE NEED FOR CLARI_CATIONS, THEREBY ASSISTING API LOOKUP FOR NOVICES LEARNING DATA WRANGLING. WE FURTHER PRESENT SOME NEGATIVE RESULTS REGARDING PERFORMANCE GAIN AND FOLLOW UP WITH A DISCUSSION ON WHY THE DI_ERENCES ARE SUBTLE AND HOW THEY CAN BE IMPROVED.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO PERFORM A SCOPING REVIEW WITH THEMATIC ANALYSIS AND IDENTIFY THE KEY THEMES ACROSS MOOCS COVERING CONTENT ON OUTBREAK AND PANDEMIC MANAGEMENT USING QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS. A TOTAL OF 458 UNIQUE RECORDS WERE FOUND, OF WHICH 69 WERE RELEVANT TO THE PANDEMIC AND OUTBREAK MANAGEMENT CONTEXT. THEMATIC ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THREE CROSS-CUTTING THEMES: (I) PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCIES, (II) INSTITUTIONAL AND ORGANISATIONAL RESPONSE, AND (III) COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION—THE GROWING ROLE OF MOOCS IN BUILDING COMPETENCIES THAT ARE EMPOWERING AND ENABLING TO INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES. A LIMITED NUMBER OF COURSES COVERED THE USE OF DATA SCIENCE IN OUTBREAK AND PANDEMIC MANAGEMENT SUGGESTING THE NEED FOR FUTURE MOOCS TO INTEGRATE DATA SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE AND METHODS IN PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION AND TRAINING.

IN THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY, WE AIMED TO UNDERSTAND (A) WHAT APT EPISTEMIC PROCESSES WITHIN DATA LITERACY LOOK LIKE IN PRACTICE WITH CHILDREN, AND (B) TO WHAT EXTENT A CURRICULUM BUILT ON A SIMULATION-BASED DATA ANALYSIS INTERVENTION (WHERE STUDENTS ENGAGE IN EXPERIMENTATION AND DATA ANALYSES THROUGH THE USE OF SIMULATIONS) PROMOTES THE EPISTEMIC PROCESSES OF DATA LITERACY. WE USED THE APT-AIR FRAMEWORK, WHICH EXPOUNDS ON THE COMPONENTS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL EPISTEMIC EDUCATION, AS A TOOL TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS’ APT EPISTEMIC PROCESSES. THE RESULTS ILLUSTRATE THAT ELEMENTARY STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO ACTIVATE COGNITIVE, EMOTIONAL, AND—TO A LESSER EXTENT—METACOGNITIVE AND COLLABORATIVE EPISTEMIC PROCESSES RELATED TO DATA LITERACY SKILLS IN THIS CONTEXT. ADDITIONALLY, THE DESIGN FEATURES EMBEDDED IN THE EXPERIMENTATION LESSON WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN ENGAGING STUDENTS IN APT EPISTEMIC PROCESSES; YET THE DATA ANALYSIS LESSON, WHILE ENGAGING STUDENTS IN FEWER PROCESSES OVERALL, WAS SUCCESSFUL IN PROMOTING STUDENTS’ ABILITY TO MAKE ACCURATE INFERENCES USING AN AGGREGATE VIEW OF DATA.

TRAINING HEALTHCARE SPECIALISTS WHO ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN BOTH HEALTH AND DATA SCIENCES IS HIGHLY REQUIRED, IMPORTANT, AND CHALLENGING. THEREFORE, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ANALYSE STUDENTS’ LEARNING EXPERIENCES THROUGH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE BOTH TEACHERS AND LEARNERS WITH INSIGHTS ABOUT EFFECTIVE LEARNING STRATEGIES AND TO IMPROVE EXISTING HDS COURSE DESIGNS. METHODS: WE APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHODS TO UNCOVER LEARNING TACTICS AND STRATEGIES EMPLOYED BY STUDENTS IN AN HDS MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSE WITH OVER 3,000 STUDENTS ENROLLED. WE ALSO USED STATISTICAL TESTS TO EXPLORE STUDENTS’ ENGAGEMENT WITH DIFFERENT RESOURCES (SUCH AS READING MATERIALS AND LECTURE VIDEOS) AND THEIR LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT WITH VARIOUS HDS TOPICS. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT STUDENTS IN HDS EMPLOYED FOUR LEARNING TACTICS, SUCH AS ACTIVELY CONNECTING NEW INFORMATION TO THEIR PRIOR KNOWLEDGE, TAKING ASSESSMENTS AND PRACTISING PROGRAMMING TO EVALUATE THEIR UNDERSTANDING, COLLABORATING WITH THEIR CLASSMATES, AND REPEATING INFORMATION TO MEMORISE. BASED ON THE EMPLOYED TACTICS, WE ALSO FOUND THREE TYPES OF LEARNING STRATEGIES, INCLUDING LOW ENGAGEMENT (SURFACE LEARNERS), MODERATE ENGAGEMENT (STRATEGIC LEARNERS), AND HIGH ENGAGEMENT (DEEP LEARNERS), WHICH ARE IN LINE WITH WELL-KNOWN EDUCATIONAL THEORIES. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS ALLOCATE MORE TIME TO PRACTICAL TOPICS, SUCH AS PROJECTS AND DISCUSSIONS, MAKE CONNECTIONS AMONG CONCEPTS, AND EMPLOY PEER LEARNING. CONCLUSIONS: WE APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES TO PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO HDS EDUCATION. BASED ON THE FINDINGS, WE PROVIDE PEDAGOGICAL SUGGESTIONS NOT ONLY FOR COURSE DESIGNERS BUT ALSO FOR TEACHERS AND LEARNERS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE OF HDS STUDENTS. © THE AUTHOR(S) 2024.","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; EDUCATIONAL DATA MINING; HEALTH DATA SCIENCE; HEALTH INFORMATICS; LEARNING ANALYTICS; LEARNING ENGAGEMENT; LEARNING STRATEGY; LEARNING TACTIC; MEDICAL EDUCATION","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; CURRICULUM; DATA SCIENCE; HUMANS; LEARNING; ADULT; ARTICLE; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; CLINICIAN; DATA MINING; EDUCATIONAL THEORY; HEALTH DATA; HUMAN; LEARNING; MEDICAL EDUCATION; MEDICAL INFORMATICS; SCIENCE EDUCATION; STUDENT ENGAGEMENT; TEACHER; VIDEORECORDING; CURRICULUM; DATA SCIENCE; EDUCATION; LEARNING","UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH, ED; MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, MRC, (MR/N013166/1)","FUNDING TEXT 1: WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE PRECISION MEDICINE PROGRAMME OF THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH, AS WELL AS THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT AIMED AT ENHANCING HEALTH DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION.

AT THE SAME TIME, PHILOSOPHERS OF SCIENCE FACE THE CHALLENGE OF MAKING THEIR EXPERTISE ACCESSIBLE FOR SCIENTISTS IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT CAN IMPROVE EVERYDAY RESEARCH PRACTICE. HERE, WE INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY OF APPROACHING THESE CHALLENGES TOGETHER. IN CURRENT AND PROPOSED APPROACHES TO BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, WE IDENTIFY A DOMINANT FOCUS ON ONLY ONE ASPECT OF CONDUCTING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: UNDERSTANDING AND USING DATA, RESEARCH METHODS, AND STATISTICAL METHODS. WE ARGUE THAT THIS APPROACH CANNOT SOLVE BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE’S CHALLENGE AND WE PROPOSE TO SHIFT THE FOCUS TO FOUR OTHER ASPECTS OF CONDUCTING RESEARCH: MAKING AND JUSTIFYING DECISIONS IN RESEARCH DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION, EXPLAINING THEIR EPISTEMIC AND NON-EPISTEMIC EFFECTS, BALANCING VARYING RESPONSIBILITIES, AND REPORTING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. ATTENDING TO THESE ASPECTS REQUIRES LEARNING ON DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS THAN SOLELY LEARNING TO APPLY TECHNIQUES (FIRST DIMENSION). IT ALSO REQUIRES LEARNING TO MAKE CHOICES (SECOND DIMENSION) AND TO UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE BEHIND CHOICES (THIRD DIMENSION). THIS COULD BE FOSTERED BY INTEGRATING PHILOSOPHICAL TRAINING IN BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. FURTHERMORE, PHILOSOPHICAL TRAINING FOSTERS A FOURTH DIMENSION OF LEARNING, NAMELY, UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF SCIENCE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EXPLAIN HOW WE IDENTIFIED THE FIVE ASPECTS OF CONDUCTING RESEARCH AND THE FOUR DIMENSIONS OF LEARNING, AND WHY ATTENDING TO THE FOURTH DIMENSION IS ESSENTIAL. WE DISCUSS EDUCATIONAL APPROACHES TO ATTEND TO ALL ASPECTS AND DIMENSIONS, AND PRESENT INITIAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES TO IMPLEMENT THESE APPROACHES. © 2022, THE AUTHOR(S).","","","UNIVERSITEIT UTRECHT, UU","THIS STUDY WAS FUNDED BY UTRECHT UNIVERSITY.

IN RESPONSE, THERE HAS BEEN GROWING ATTENTION IN RESEARCH AND PRACTICE EMPHASIZING PRE-COLLEGE GROUPS. THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE GROWING RECOGNITION-REFLECTED IN INITIATIVES LIKE CS4ALL, CODE.ORG, BOOTSTRAP: DATA SCIENCE, EXPLORING COMPUTER SCIENCE-THAT LEARNING EXPERIENCES BEFORE COLLEGE ARE CONSEQUENTIAL IN SUSTAINING A ROBUST PIPELINE OF COMPUTER SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS. DESPITE THESE INROADS, THERE IS JUSTIFIABLE CONCERN THAT EXISTING EFFORTS MIGHT NOT FULLY SUPPORT LEARNER DEVELOPMENT IN THE NECESSARY CONCEPTUAL, EPISTEMOLOGICAL, AND HEURISTIC STYLES NEEDED TO PRODUCTIVELY PARSE AND UNDERSTAND 'BIG DATA.' THIS IS BECAUSE COMPUTING-BASED CURRICULA THAT INCLUDE DATA SCIENCE OFTEN INVOLVE DATA CURATED BY OTHERS (RATHER THAN LEARNERS DIRECTLY), WHICH RESULTS IN SIMULATED VERSIONS OF PRACTICE INSTEAD OF ENGAGEMENT THAT IS REALISTICALLY DISCURSIVE AND MESSY. THIS IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE PERSISTENT SHORTAGE OF K-12 COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS IN GENERAL AND EVEN FEWER WHO CAN DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT CURRICULA THAT SUPPORT AUTHENTIC ENGAGEMENT WITH DATA SCIENCE. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, WE LEVERAGE CULTURALLY RELEVANT AND CONSTRUCTIONIST PERSPECTIVES IN A SANDBOX (I.E., OPEN-ENDED) SCIENCE WHERE TOOLS LIKE SCRATCH AND ELECTRONIC TEXTILES (E-TEXTILES) HAVE HAD SUCCESS EXPANDING POSSIBILITIES IN COMPUTING TO ALSO INCLUDE ACTIVITIES WHERE LEARNERS CAN ENGAGE BROADLY ALONG VARIED PURSUITS-AND ENCOUNTER CHALLENGES THAT SPUR COMPUTATIONAL THINKING AND PROBLEM-SOLVING. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT LEARNING ACTIVITIES FRAMED IN THIS WAY ENCOURAGE KNOWLEDGE CONSTRUCTION, PRACTICE LITERACIES, AND SERIOUSLY IMPACT LEARNER ATTITUDES, INTEREST, AND PERCEPTIONS OF GROWTH IN THE FIELD. THIS LATTER SET OF SELF-CONCEPT MEASURES REPRESENTS A FEW OF MANY RELATED KEY PREDICTORS OF LONG-TERM FIELD PARTICIPATION AND PERSISTENCE. IN THIS WORK-IN-PROGRESS SCHOLARSHIP OF DISCOVERY RESEARCH, WE CO-DEVELOP, WITH YOUTH AND EDUCATORS, 'CODING LIKE A DATA MINER' (CLDM)-A SANDBOX APPROACH TO COMPUTING-BASED DATA SCIENCE WHEREIN LEARNERS ACCESS A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM, TWITTER, TO MINE, ANALYZE, AND UNDERSTAND QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA SOURCES. IN THIS PRELIMINARY WORK, WE ASSESS AFFORDANCES IN CO-DEVELOPING A CURRICULUM THAT LEVERAGES SANDBOX APPROACHES TO DATA SCIENCE. ULTIMATELY (AND WHAT WILL BE PRESENTED IN OUR FINAL SUBMISSION), WE AIM TO STUDY LEARNING OUTCOMES WHEN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS' ACCESS, ANALYZE AND MAKE SENSE OF 'BIG DATA' SETS OF THEIR OWN. WE COLLABORATED WITH HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS IN A WEST TEXAS/PASO DEL NORTE REGION WHERE COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATORS ARE EXCEPTIONALLY SCARCE AND WHERE THERE IS AN URGENT AND PERSISTENT NEED TO SUPPORT UNDERREPRESENTED LEARNER ACCESS TO BURGEONING AREAS OF COMPUTING. USING MIXED-METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES (E.G., QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF LEARNER PRE- AND POST-SURVEY RESPONSES ALONG WITH QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW DATA), WE ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT AFFORDANCES EXIST USING CO-DESIGN APPROACHES TO DEVELOP SANDBOX DATA SCIENCE FOR PRE-COLLEGE LEARNERS? (2) WHICH COMPUTATIONAL CONCEPTS DO STUDENTS LEARN WHEN CARRYING OUT CLDM ACTIVITIES, (3) WHICH COMPUTATIONAL PRACTICES DO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ENACT WHEN MINING, PROCESSING, AND ANALYZING BIG DATA SETS IN CLDM? (4) HOW DO LEARNER KNOWLEDGE AND PERCEPTIONS ABOUT DATA SCIENCE SHIFT AFTER PARTICIPATING IN CLDM? WE USE CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVES IN COMPUTING EDUCATION, CONSTRUCTIONISM, AND EQUITY TO DISCUSS HOW OPEN-ENDED SANDBOX APPROACHES TO COMPUTING-BASED DATA SCIENCE SUPPORT LEARNER COMPUTATIONAL THINKING, PRACTICE LITERACIES, AND FIELD PERCEPTIONS. © 2023 IEEE.","COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION; COMPUTER SCIENCE LEARNING; CONSTRUCTIONISM; CURRICULUM DESIGN; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION","DIGITAL DEVICES; E-LEARNING; EDUCATION COMPUTING; ENGINEERING EDUCATION; SMART TEXTILES; SOCIAL NETWORKING (ONLINE); STUDENTS; COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION; COMPUTER SCIENCE LEARNING; CONSTRUCTIONISM; CURRICULA DESIGN; DATA MINERS; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; PRE-COLLEGE; SCIENCE EDUCATION; SCIENCE LEARNING; CURRICULA","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, (2137708); NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF","ACKNOWLEDGMENT THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED IN PART BY A GRANT FROM THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (#2137708).

THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE POTENTIAL USE OF CHATGPT, A GENERATIVE AI TOOL, IN PROVIDING PERSONALIZED LEARNING EXPERIENCES FOR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON DEEP LEARNING. THE PAPER PRESENTS A CASE STUDY THAT APPLIES THE 5ES MODEL TO TEST PERSONALIZED LEARNING FOR STUDENTS USING CHATGPT. THE STUDY AIMS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF HOW EDUCATORS CAN LEVERAGE CHATGPT IN THEIR PEDAGOGY TO ENHANCE STUDENT LEARNING, AND WHETHER CHATGPT CAN PROVIDE A BETTER LEARNING EXPERIENCE THAN TRADITIONAL TEACHING METHODS. THE PAPER ALSO DISCUSSES THE LIMITATIONS FACED DURING THE STUDY AND THE FINDINGS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CHATGPT CAN BE A VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, PROVIDING PERSONALIZED AND INSTANT FEEDBACK TO LEARNERS. HOWEVER, ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS THE POTENTIAL FOR BIASED OR INACCURATE RESPONSES AND THE NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY IN AI-GENERATED CONTENT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY ADDRESSED BY EDUCATORS. THE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS CHATGPT’S POTENTIAL AS A RESEARCH TOOL FOR DATA SCIENCE EDUCATORS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AI IN PERSONALIZED LEARNING EXPERIENCES. OVERALL, THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE ONGOING DIALOGUE ON THE ROLE OF AI IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO HOW EDUCATORS CAN UTILIZE CHATGPT TO ENHANCE STUDENT LEARNING AND ENGAGEMENT. © (2023), (SCIENCE AND INFORMATION ORGANIZATION).

THESE BENEFITS INCLUDE THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE METACOGNITIVE PROCESS, INCREASED MOTIVATION AND SELF-EFFICACY, AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFINE COMMUNICATION SKILLS. THESE BENEFITS ARE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. THOUGH NOT AS WIDELY STUDIED, TEACHING ASSIGNMENTS, WHERE STUDENTS DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCY THROUGH TEACHING OTHERS CAN BE USED AS A FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT TOOL. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES AN ""ALTERNATIVE MIDTERM""EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED IN AN UNDERGRADUATE INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE CLASS. IN THIS PILOT, STUDENTS WERE ASKED TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR NEWLY LEARNED DATA SCIENCE SKILLS BY TEACHING THEM TO INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT DATA SCIENCE BACKGROUNDS. THE EVIDENCE OF LEARNING WILL BE ILLUSTRATED THROUGH AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE STUDENTS' TEACHING PRODUCTS. THESE PRODUCTS CONSIST OF TWO PARTS: (1) ""TEACHING PREPARATION""MATERIALS, SUCH AS PYTHON NOTEBOOKS CONTAINING PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS CRAFTED BY THE STUDENTS, AND (2) ""TEACHING IMPLEMENTATION"", VIDEO RECORDINGS OF REAL-TIME INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE STUDENTS AND THEIR ""TUTEES.""THE PAPER WILL ALSO PRESENT QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK FROM THE STUDENTS, HIGHLIGHTING PROMISING SIGNS OF ENGAGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE.

THESE PROGRAMS FOCUS ON DEVELOPING BOTH ""CLASSIC""INFORMATION SCIENCE COMPETENCIES AS WELL AS CORE DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES AMONG THEIR STUDENTS. SINCE DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL THINKING, DEPARTMENTAL OFFICIALS AND PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS OFTEN RAISE CONCERNS REGARDING THE APPROPRIATE BACKGROUND STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE IN ORDER TO SUCCEED IN THIS NEWLY INTRODUCED COMPUTATIONAL CONTENT OF THE LIS TRAINING PROGRAMS. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS, WE REPORT ON AN EXPLORATORY STUDY THROUGH WHICH WE EXAMINED THE 2020 AND 2021 STUDENT CLASSES OF BAR-ILAN UNIVERSITY'S LIS GRADUATE TRAINING, FOCUSING ON THE COMPUTATIONAL DATA SCIENCE COURSES (I.E., SUPERVISED AND UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING). OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT CONTRARY TO MANY OF THE CONCERNS RAISED, STUDENTS FROM THE HUMANITIES PERFORMED AS WELL (AND IN SOME CASES SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER) ON DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES COMPARED TO THOSE FROM THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HAD BETTER SUCCESS IN THE TRAINING PROGRAM AS A WHOLE. IN ADDITION, STUDENTS' UNDERGRADUATE GPA ACTED AS AN ADEQUATE INDICATOR FOR BOTH THEIR SUCCESS IN THE TRAINING PROGRAM AND IN THE DATA SCIENCE PART THEREOF. IN ADDITION, WE FIND NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT CONCERNS REGARDING AGE OR SEX. FINALLY, OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE COMPUTATIONAL DATA SCIENCE PART OF STUDENTS' TRAINING IS VERY MUCH ALIGNED WITH THE REST OF THEIR TRAINING PROGRAM. © ASSOCIATION FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE EDUCATION, 2023.","COMPUTATIONAL DATA SCIENCE TRAINING; DATA SCIENCE COMPETENCIES; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION","","","","ADER H.

ONE OF THE KEY REASONS FOR STUDENT ATTRITION IS THE INABILITY OF STUDENTS TO DEVELOP AN IDENTITY AND A SENSE OF BELONGING. THIS STUDY AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF A DATA SCIENCE LEARNING COMMUNITY IN HELPING STUDENTS TO DEVELOP IDENTITY AND A SENSE OF BELONGING. THE STUDY USED A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE THE DATA. THE STUDY USED A PRE–POST SURVEY TO UNDERSTAND STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS REGARDING IDENTITY FORMATION AND SENSE OF BELONGING. THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY STUDY INDICATED THAT THE PERCEPTION OF IDENTITY FORMATION AND SENSE OF BELONGING INCREASED AS STUDENTS PROGRESSED THROUGH THE SEMESTER. TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE REASONS FOR THE INCREASE IN THE PERCEPTION OF IDENTITY FORMATION AND SENSE OF BELONGING, IN-DEPTH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED. THE RESULTS OF THE INTERVIEW REVEALED THAT LIVING IN THE DATA SCIENCE LEARNING COMMUNITY, PARTICIPATING IN VARIOUS EVENTS AND INTERACTING WITH FACULTY, STAFF AND WORKING WITH PEERS OF SIMILAR INTEREST HELPED STUDENTS TO DEVELOP A DATA SCIENCE IDENTITY AND LEADER IDENTITY, AS WELL AS EXPERIENCE SENSE OF BELONGING. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.","COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; IDENTITY FORMATION; LEARNING COMMUNITY; SENSE OF BELONGING; UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","","PURDUE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST; LILLY ENDOWMENT","THIS RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED IN PART BY THE LILLY ENDOWMENT CHARTING THE FUTURE PHASE I PLANNING GRANT, THROUGH THE PURDUE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST.

HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL TECHNIQUES LEARNERS NEED TO BECOME PROFICIENT IN ARE STILL SOMEWHAT “IN-CONSTRUCTION”, AS THE RELATIVELY NEW FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE IS CONSTANTLY EXPANDING TO MEET NEW DATA-RELATED DEMANDS. DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION NEEDS TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE MEANS TO KEEP UP WITH THIS EXPANSION THAT FOCUS LESS ON PROFICIENCY IN SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES, BUT RATHER INTRODUCE NOVICES TO AUTHENTIC DATA PRACTICES, AND THE AUTHENTIC PURPOSES DIRECTING THE AUTHENTIC PRACTICES. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON A SPECIFIC PRACTICE, THE USE OF SIMULATIONS TO GENERATE AND EXAMINE DATA, IN THE CONTEXT OF AUTHENTIC SCIENTIFIC CITIZEN SCIENCE RESEARCH. WE PROVIDE A CASE STUDY OF ONE PAIR OF MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS' ENGAGEMENT IN AN EXTENDED LEARNING SEQUENCE INCLUDING SIMULATION ACTIVITIES INSPIRED BY AUTHENTIC DATA PRACTICES, ADAPTED TO ALSO BE AUTHENTIC FOR YOUNG STUDENTS. WHILE THE SIMULATION ACTIVITY WAS INSPIRED BY THE SCIENTISTS' PURPOSES, OUR FINDINGS ILLUSTRATE FOUR DIFFERENT ACTUAL PURPOSES THE STUDENTS ATTRIBUTED TO IT. WE ALSO SHOW THAT AS THE STUDENTS DEEPENED THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE SIMULATION, THEY GRADUALLY APPROPRIATED ITS INTENDED PURPOSE, ALONGSIDE ARTICULATING MORE MATURE VIEWS OF DATA-RELATED CONCEPTS. THE CONCLUSIONS SUMMARIZE THE FOUR DIFFERENT PURPOSES THE STUDENTS EXPRESSED AND IDENTIFY ASPECTS OF DESIGN THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE GRADUAL RE-SHAPING PROCESS OF THEIR ACTUAL PURPOSES. PRACTITIONER NOTES WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC INTRODUCING STUDENTS TO DATA SCIENCE AND STATISTICS HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL NOWADAYS. STUDENTS NEED TO BE INTRODUCED TO AUTHENTIC DATA PRACTICES, BUT ALSO TO THE AUTHENTIC PURPOSES MOTIVATING THESE PRACTICES. UTILIZING COMPUTERIZED SIMULATIONS IS A COMMON AUTHENTIC PRACTICE IN SCIENCE AND STATISTICS. THE PEDAGOGICAL, INTENDED, USE OF COMPUTERIZED SIMULATIONS CAN BE INSPIRED BY THE AUTHENTIC PURPOSES BUT SHOULD ALSO BE ADAPTED TO BE AUTHENTIC FOR THE STUDENTS. STUDENTS MAY HAVE ACTUAL PURPOSES THAT DIFFER FROM THE AUTHENTIC AND INTENDED PURPOSES. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS A CASE STUDY OF A PAIR OF MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS' ENGAGEMENT WITH A COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION TOOL, AS PART OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN A CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECT. THE STUDENTS EXPRESSED FOUR ACTUAL PURPOSES FOR THE SIMULATION. THE STUDENTS' INITIAL PURPOSES DIFFERED FROM THE INTENDED PURPOSES, LIMITING THEIR PARTICIPATION. KEY ASPECTS OF THE OVERALL ACTIVITY DESIGN ULTIMATELY SUPPORTED THE STUDENTS TO APPROPRIATE THE INTENDED PURPOSE OF THE SIMULATION AND MORE DEEPLY ENGAGE WITH THE INTENDED STATISTICAL NOTIONS. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND/OR POLICY IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT STUDENTS MAY ATTRIBUTE PURPOSES THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE OF THE TEACHER OR THE ACTIVITY DESIGNER, TO ANY LEARNING ACTIVITY THEY ENGAGE IN. MAKING THE INTENDED PURPOSES MORE EXPLICIT MAY BE HELPFUL, BUT POTENTIALLY NOT ENOUGH FOR STUDENTS TO APPROPRIATE THEM. RESEARCHERS' PROMPTS, STUDENTS' FREEDOM TO RESHAPE THEIR USE OF THE SIMULATION TOOL AND PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION NORMS CAN BE BENEFICIAL ASPECTS. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DESCRIBE SYNERGIES AND TENSIONS BETWEEN DATA SCIENCE AND THE ARTS, AND HOW THESE CAN CREATE OR CONSTRAIN OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNERS TO ENGAGE IN IIR. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE AUTHORS CO-DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED FOUR ARTS-INTEGRATED DATA LITERACY UNITS WITH 10 TEACHERS OF ARTS AND MATHEMATICS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOMS FROM FOUR DIFFERENT SCHOOLS IN THE USA. THE DATA INCLUDE STUDENT-GENERATED ARTWORK AND THEIR WRITTEN RATIONALES, AND INTERVIEWS WITH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. THROUGH MAXIMUM VARIATION SAMPLING, THE AUTHORS IDENTIFIED EXAMPLES FROM THE DATA TO ILLUSTRATE DISCIPLINARY SYNERGIES AND TENSIONS THAT APPEARED TO SUPPORT DIFFERENT IIR PROCESSES AMONG STUDENTS. FINDINGS: ASPECTS OF ARTISTIC REPRESENTATION, INCLUDING EMBODIMENT, NARRATIVE AND VISUAL IMAGE; AND ASPECTS OF THE CULTURE OF ARTS, INCLUDING AN EMPHASIS ON PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF SUBJECTIVITY AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE AUDIENCE’S PERSPECTIVE, CREATED SYNERGIES AND TENSIONS THAT BOTH OFFERED AND HINDERED OPPORTUNITIES FOR IIR (I.E. GOING BEYOND DATA, USING DATA AS EVIDENCE AND EXPRESSING UNCERTAINTY). ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY ANSWERS CALLS FOR HUMANISTIC APPROACHES TO DATA LITERACY EDUCATION. IT CONTRIBUTES AN INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE ON DATA LITERACY THAT COMPLEMENTS OTHER CONTEXT-ORIENTED PERSPECTIVES ON DATA SCIENCE. THIS STUDY ALSO OFFERS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW DESIGNERS AND EDUCATORS CAN CAPITALIZE ON SYNERGIES AND MITIGATE TENSIONS BETWEEN DOMAINS TO PROMOTE SUCCESSFUL IIR IN ARTS-INTEGRATED DATA LITERACY EDUCATION. © 2023, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.","ARTS-INTEGRATION; CLASSROOMS; CO-DESIGN; DATA LITERACY; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; INFORMAL INFERENTIAL REASONING; INTERDISCIPLINARY LEARNING; MIDDLE SCHOOL; STEAM","","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, (1908030, 1908142, 1908557); NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF","THIS RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED BY A COLLABORATIVE DR K-12 GRANT FROM THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, AWARD NUMBERS: 1908557, 1908030 AND 1908142.","ASLAN C.E., PINSKY M.L., RYAN M.E., SOUTHER S., TERRELL K.A., CULTIVATING CREATIVITY IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE, CONSERVATION BIOLOGY, 28, 2, PP. 345-353, (2014); BACH B., STEFANER M., BOY J., DRUCKER S., BARTRAM L., WOOD J., CIUCCARELLI P., ENGELHARDT Y., KOPPEN U., TVERSKY B., NARRATIVE DESIGN PATTERNS FOR DATA-DRIVEN STORYTELLING, DATA-DRIVEN STORYTELLING, PP. 107-133, (2018); BEN-ZVI D., GIL E., APEL N., WHAT IS HIDDEN BEYOND THE DATA?

AS AN EMERGING INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDY FIELD, DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM IS TYPICALLY A COLLECTION OF INDIVIDUAL DATA SCIENCE RELATED COURSES FROM DIFFERENT SCHOOLS AND DEPARTMENTS, MOST OF WHICH ARE TEACHING DATA SCIENCE IN A SILOED FASHION. THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO MAP THE LANDSCAPE OF EXISTING CURRICULA AND EXPLORE HOW ACADEMIC LIBRARIES CAN COLLABORATE AND CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERGRADUATE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYZED TEACHING CONTENT AND TOPICS OF OVER 100 DATA SCIENCE RELATED COURSES AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY TO MAP THE LANDSCAPE AND EXPLORE ROLES OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES TO SUPPORT DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION CURRICULUM. OUR RESULTS INDICATE MOST EXISTING COURSES FOCUSED ON ‘HARD-CORE’ SCIENTIFIC ANALYTIC PRINCIPLES, SUCH AS COMPUTER SCIENCE, STATISTICS, AND DOMAIN-SPECIFIC SKILLS. COURSES OF DATA-ORIENTED SKILLS, SUCH AS DATA MANAGEMENT, DATA ETHICS, AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS WERE LIMITED ACROSS DISCIPLINES. IN ADDITION, DATA SCIENCE COURSES WERE MORE LIKELY TARGETING STEM STUDENTS AT UPPER LEVELS (3RD AND 4TH YEAR STUDENTS). ACADEMIC LIBRARIES CAN ENRICH DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION EFFORTS, BY SUPPORTING CREDIT COURSES, CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS, AND OTHER CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES TO PROVIDE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES TO ALL STUDENTS, PARTICULARLY 1ST AND 2ND YEAR STUDENTS AND NON-STEM MAJORS. © 2021 ELSEVIER INC.","COLLEGE; CURRICULUM; DATA ETHICS; DATA MANAGEMENT; DATA SCIENCE; EDUCATION; LIBRARIES","","","","AASHEIM C.L., WILLIAMS S., RUTNER P., GARDINER A., DATA ANALYTICS VS.

THIS WORK DEPICTS THE INTERDISCIPLINARY LANDSCAPE OF ISCHOOLS FROM RESEARCH OUTCOMES PUBLICATION KNOWLEDGE  DIFFUSION INPUT REFERENCE OUTPUT CITATION AND SCHOOL LEVEL BASED ON THE WOS PUBLICATIONS OF 36 ICAUCUS MEMBERS IN ISCHOOLS FROM 2009 TO 2018. INTERDISCIPLINARITY IS MEASURED BY THREE INDICATORS NAMELY VARIETY BALANCE AND INTENSITY. WE FOUND THAT 1 THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERISTICS OF RESEARCH OUTCOMES ARE HIGH SUBJECT VARIETY AND HIGH SUBJECT IMBALANCE. FIRSTLY THE PAPERS PUBLISHED BY ISCHOOLS INCLUDE 227 DISCIPLINES COVERING 89. 37% OF THE WOS SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION THE NUMBER OF DISCIPLINES INVOLVED IN THE PAPERS IS GENERALLY INCREASING. SECONDLY THE PUBLICATIONS ARE RELATIVELY CONCENTRATED ON A FEW DISCIPLINES SUCH AS LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE. IN ADDITION THE OVERALL INTERDISCIPLINARY INTENSITY OF RESEARCH OUTCOMES IS 56. 81% WHICH MEANS 56. 81% OF PUBLICATIONS INVOLVED TWO OR MORE DISCIPLINES REFLECTING THEIR MULTIDISCIPLINARY NATURE. 2 THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERISTICS OF KNOWLEDGE DIFFUSION ARE HIGH SUBJECT VARIETY AND RELATIVELY HIGH SUBJECT IMBALANCE. FIRSTLY KNOWLEDGE INPUT AND KNOWLEDGE OUTPUT COVER AROUND 254 WOS SUBJECT CLASSIFICATIONS WHICH SHOWS RESEARCHES OF ISCHOOLS ARE RELATIVELY OPEN. SECONDLY ACCORDING TO THE CUMULATIVE PERCENTAGE OF THE DISCIPLINARY DISTRIBUTION THE TOP TEN DISCIPLINES IN KNOWLEDGE INPUT AND OUTPUT HAVE RESPECTIVELY REACHED 44% AND 46% INDICATING THE RELATIVE CONCENTRATION OF KNOWLEDGE DIFFUSION. IN ADDITION THE INTERDISCIPLINARY INTENSITY OF KNOWLEDGE INPUT IS 54. 71% INDICATING THAT ISCHOOLS HAVE CITED MANY PAPERS FROM OTHER DISCIPLINES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT IS MAINLY RELATED TO THE CROSS-BORDER INTEGRATION OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE. THE INTERDISCIPLINARY INTENSITY OF KNOWLEDGE OUTPUT IS 55. 11% WHICH INDICATES THAT ISCHOOLS PAPERS HAVE BEEN WIDELY CITED BY PAPERS FROM OTHER DISCIPLINES AND ISCHOOLS HAVE FORMED A STRONG CAPACITY TO OUTPUT AND TO INFILTRATE KNOWLEDGE TO OTHER DISCIPLINES. 3 THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERISTICS OF ISCHOOLS MEMBERS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. THE INTERDISCIPLINARY DIVERSITY OF UC IRVINE CORNELL UNIVERSITY AND MONASH UNIVERSITY ARE AT THE FOREFRONT WHILE THE INTERDISCIPLINARY DIVERSITY OF HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY AND RENMIN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA LAG BEHIND. UC IRVINE AND CORNELL UNIVERSITY PUBLISH VERY LOW PERCENTAGES OF PAPERS IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION  SCIENCE. ACCORDING TO THE FACTOR ANALYSIS OF RESEARCH OUTCOMES KNOWLEDGE INPUT AND KNOWLEDGE OUTPUT 36 COLLEGES CAN BE DIVIDED INTO SIX CATEGORIES LIBRARY INFORMATION COMPUTER SCIENCE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION RESEARCH COMMUNICATION AND MANAGEMENT. THE NUMBER OF COLLEGES IN THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CATEGORY IS THE LARGEST. 4 LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IS CLOSELY RELATED TO IFIELD BUT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ALSO EXIST. LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IS THE SUBJECT WITH THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF RESEARCH OUTPUTS AND THE MOST IMPORTANT SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE IFIELD. BUT THE PROPORTION IS NOT HIGH WITH 22. 87% IN RESEARCH OUTCOMES 13. 05% IN REFERENCE AND 8. 88% IN CITED PAPER. IT ALSO INDICATES A DOWNWARD TREND OVER TIME. THE TENDENCY OF ISCHOOLS TO ELIMINATE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IS OBVIOUS. IN ADDITION THOUGH MANY COLLEGES ARE CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE SUBJECT MANY OF THEM HAVE A CLEAR TREND OF DIVERSIFICATION. THERE ARE SEVERAL LIMITATIONS IN THIS STUDY. TAKING THE ICAUCUS MEMBER AS AN EXAMPLE TO EXPLORE THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERISTICS OF ISCHOOLS RESEARCHES THE GENERALIZABILITY OF ITS CONCLUSIONS NEEDS TO BE FURTHER VERIFIED. SECOND IN ADDITION TO THE DIVERSITY BALANCE AND INTENSITY COMBINING WITH MORE COMPREHENSIVE INDICATORS MAY MAKE THE CONCLUSION MORE CREDIBLE AND COMPLETE. FINALLY THE SAMPLE DATA FROM WOS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO IMPLEMENT A THOROUGH BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS. 4 FIGS. 7 TABS. 56 REFS. © 2020, EDITORIAL OFFICE OF JOURNAL OF LIBRARY SCIENCE IN CHINA.

INITIAL WORK IN A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL SETTING SUGGESTS THAT EXPLICITLY DESIGNING FOR EXPERIENCES OF FAILURE LEADS TO BETTER LEARNING OUTCOMES THAN DESIGNING FOR SUCCESS. WE BUILD ON THIS TO REPORT ON A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WHERE STUDENTS ARE EXPOSED TO FAILURE-DRIVEN, SUCCESS-DRIVEN, OR NO EXPLICIT SCAFFOLDING IN PROBLEM-SOLVING PRIOR TO INSTRUCTION. FOR ASSESSMENTS OF NON-ISOMORPHIC CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING, OUR RESULTS ALIGN WITH THOSE FROM PRIOR WORK. DESPITE THE SIMILARITY IN POSTTEST SCORES, STUDENTS EXPOSED TO FAILURE-DRIVEN SCAFFOLDING DEMONSTRATE HIGHER QUALITY OF CONSTRUCTIVE REASONING THAN THOSE RECEIVING SUCCESS-DRIVEN SCAFFOLDING. ADDITIONALLY, OUR STUDY REVEALS LEARNING BENEFITS OF FAILURE-DRIVEN SCAFFOLDING (FOR BOTH POSTTEST SCORES AND REASONING QUALITY) ON ASSESSMENTS OF TRANSFER. SEVERAL COGNITIVE, AFFECTIVE AND META-COGNITIVE MECHANISMS ARE INVESTIGATED TO EXPLAIN ROBUST LEARNING BENEFITS OF FAILURE-DRIVEN SCAFFOLDING IN PREPARATORY PROBLEM-SOLVING. © 2021 THE AUTHOR(S)","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; FAILURE; HIGHER EDUCATION; PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING; SCAFFOLDING","","","","ACKERMAN R., THOMPSON V.A., META-REASONING: MONITORING AND CONTROL OF THINKING AND REASONING, TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES, 21, 8, PP. 607-617, (2017); ALEVEN V., CONNOLLY H., POPESCU O., MARKS J., LAMNINA M., CHASE C., AN ADAPTIVE COACH FOR INVENTION ACTIVITIES, INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION, PP. 3-14, (2017); ALEVEN V., MCLAUGHLIN E.A., GLENN R.A., KOEDINGER K.R., INSTRUCTION BASED ON ADAPTIVE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES, HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION, PP. 522-560, (2016); ALEVEN V., STAHL E., SCHWORM S., FISCHER F., WALLACE R., HELP SEEKING AND HELP DESIGN IN INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS, REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH, 73, 3, PP. 277-320, (2003); BJORK R.A., DUNLOSKY J., KORNELL N., SELF-REGULATED LEARNING: BELIEFS, TECHNIQUES, AND ILLUSIONS, ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY, 64, PP. 417-444, (2013); BRAND S., REIMER T., OPWIS K., HOW DO WE LEARN IN A NEGATIVE MOOD?

YET IT CAN BE A CHALLENGE TO FIT THE TEACHING OF SUCH SKILLS INTO THE DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM. TEAM-BASED LEARNING (TBL) IS A PEDAGOGICAL STRATEGY THAT CAN HELP EDUCATORS TEACH DATA SCIENCE BETTER BY FLIPPING THE CLASSROOM TO EMPLOY SMALL-GROUP COLLABORATIVE LEARNING TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE STUDENTS IN DOING DATA SCIENCE. A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS TEACHING METHOD IS HELPING STUDENTS ACHIEVE THE WORKFORCE-RELEVANT DATA SCIENCE LEARNING GOALS OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, TEAMWORK, AND COLLABORATION. WE DESCRIBE THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF TBL: ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURES AND FEEDBACK MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT STUDENTS COLLABORATING WITHIN PERMANENT TEAMS ON WELL-DESIGNED APPLICATION EXERCISES TO DO DATA SCIENCE. THE RESULTS OF OUR CASE STUDY OF USING TBL TO TEACH A MODERN, INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE COURSE INDICATE THAT THE COURSE EFFECTIVELY TAUGHT REPRODUCIBLE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOWS, BEGINNING R PROGRAMMING, AND COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION. STUDENTS ALSO REPORTED MUCH ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR LEARNING OF STATISTICAL THINKING AND ADVANCED R CONCEPTS. TO HELP THE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION COMMUNITY ADOPT THIS APPEALING PEDAGOGICAL STRATEGY, WE OUTLINE STEPS FOR DECIDING ON USING TBL, PREPARING AND PLANNING FOR IT, AND OVERCOMING POTENTIAL PITFALLS WHEN USING TBL TO TEACH DATA SCIENCE. © 2021 THE AUTHOR(S).

THE MODEL OF THE QUANTIFIED SELF—IN WHICH DATA ABOUT ONE’S OWN ACTIVITIES ARE COLLECTED AND MADE INTO OBJECTS OF STUDY—PROVIDES INSPIRATION FOR ONE SUCH APPROACH. BY DRAWING ON WHAT ONE ALREADY KNOWS ABOUT THEIR SELF AND THEIR PRIOR EXPERIENCES, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO BOOTSTRAP STUDENTS’ ABILITIES TO INTERPRET AND MAKE SENSE OF DATA. TAKING THAT POSSIBILITY SERIOUSLY, THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES SOME OF THE GAINS OBSERVED IN STUDENTS’ STATISTICAL REASONING FOLLOWING A QUANTIFIED SELF, WEARABLES-BASED ELEMENTARY STATISTICS UNIT AND PROVIDES A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK DRAWING FROM COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY, EMBODIMENT, AND SITUATIVE PERSPECTIVES TO CHARACTERIZE HOW PRIOR EXPERIENCE IS USED AS A RESOURCE IN DATA SENSE-MAKING WHEN THE DATA ARE ABOUT STUDENTS’ OWN PHYSICAL EXPERIENCES. THIS FRAMEWORK CENTRALIZES AND INTERROGATES THE WORK OF “REMEMBERING” PRIOR EXPERIENCES AND ARTICULATES HOW REMEMBERING IS INVOLVED IN INTERPRETING QUANTIFIED SELF DATA. SPECIFICALLY, THE FRAMEWORK EMPHASIZES THAT REMEMBERING IN SERVICE OF DATA INTERPRETATION IS A RECONSTRUCTIVE ACT THAT DRAWS FROM BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIFIC EMBODIED RESOURCES AND THAT THE WORK OF RECONSTRUCTIVE REMEMBERING IN THE CLASSROOM IS BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND MULTI-PARTICIPANT WORK.

THE USE OF COMPUTING SOFTWARE HAS BECOME UBIQUITOUS AND A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF DATA SCIENCE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY ESSENTIAL FOR RESEARCHERS IN ALL DOMAINS. HOWEVER, CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT FOCUSING ON IMPARTING FOUNDATIONAL PROGRAMMING SKILLS AND FUNDAMENTALS OF DATA SCIENCE FOR RESEARCHERS IN DOMAINS OTHER THAN COMPUTING HAS BEEN SCARCE. THUS, THERE IS AN UNMET NEED FOR CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT INVOLVING COMPUTATIONAL THINKING, PROGRAMMING, AND THE FUNDAMENTALS OF DATA SCIENCE FOR THIS AUDIENCE. RECOGNIZING THESE GROWING NEEDS AND DEMANDS OF RESEARCHERS TO LEARN PROGRAMMING AND DATA SCIENCE THAT CAN THEN BE APPLIED TO THEIR AREA OF RESEARCH OR PRACTICE, WE DEVELOPED AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE IN PROGRAMMING AND DATA SCIENCE FOR PDRS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE COURSE WAS TO DEVELOP COMPUTATIONAL THINKING SKILLS IN PDRS WHO HAIL FROM BACKGROUNDS THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY NOT FOCUSED ON INCULCATING COMPUTATIONAL THINKING. THIS COURSE COVERED THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF PROGRAMMING USING EITHER PYTHON OR R - LANGUAGES THAT RESEARCHERS OUTSIDE THE COMPUTING COMMUNITY USE IN NUMEROUS WAYS INCLUDING THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF LARGE DATASETS THAT ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMMON IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. FURTHER, PDRS ENROLLED IN THE COURSE WERE INTRODUCED TO SOME OF THE BROAD CATEGORIES OF PROBLEMS IN DATA SCIENCE - EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS, CLASSIFICATION, REGRESSION, AND CLUSTERING - ALONG WITH RELEVANT ALGORITHMS AND HOW THEY CAN BE APPLIED TO REAL-WORLD DATASETS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE DOMAINS USING PACKAGES OR LIBRARIES IN PYTHON OR R. WE ALSO REPORT THE FEEDBACK FROM THE ENROLLED PDRS, LESSONS LEARNED, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INSTRUCTORS INTERESTED IN DESIGNING SIMILAR CURRICULA. OUR COURSE FOCUSING ON COMPUTING AND DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION FOR POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLARS FROM A NON-COMPUTING BACKGROUND DEMONSTRATES A PROMISING MODEL FOR INCORPORATING COMPUTING EDUCATION IN OTHER AREAS OF STUDY THAT DO NOT TRADITIONALLY HAVE A FOCUS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION AS WELL AS IN CONTINUING EDUCATION. © 2022 IEEE.","COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION;

OUR WORK PRESENTS A FIRST STEP IN THIS DIRECTION, BY LEVERAGING THE CODING METRICS FROM TRADITIONAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (HALSTEAD VOLUME AND CYCLOMATIC COMPLEXITY) IN COMBINATION WITH THOSE THAT REFLECT A DATA SCIENCE PROJECT'S LEARNING OBJECTIVES (NUMBER OF LIBRARY CALLS AND NUMBER OF COMMON LIBRARY CALLS WITH THE SOLUTION CODE). THROUGH THESE METRICS, WE EXAMINED THE CODE SUBMISSIONS OF 97 STUDENTS ACROSS TWO SEMESTERS OF AN INTRODUCTORY DATA SCIENCE COURSE. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE METRICS CAN IDENTIFY CASES WHERE STUDENTS HAD OVERLY COMPLICATED CODES AND WOULD BENEFIT FROM SCAFFOLDING FEEDBACK. THE NUMBER OF LIBRARY CALLS, IN PARTICULAR, WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF CHANGES IN SUBMISSION SCORE AND SUBMISSION RUNTIME, WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE DISTINCTIVE NATURE OF DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMMING. WE CONCLUDE WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR EXTENDING OUR ANALYSES TOWARDS MORE ACTIONABLE INTERVENTION STRATEGIES, FOR EXAMPLE BY TRACKING THE FINE-GRAINED SUBMISSION GRADING OUTPUTS THROUGHOUT A STUDENT'S SUBMISSION HISTORY, TO BETTER MODEL AND SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR DATA SCIENCE LEARNING PROCESS. © 2021 OWNER/AUTHOR.","CODING METRICS;

DATA SCIENCE IS A NEW AND INTERDISCIPLINARY STEM-ORIENTED DOMAIN, INTEGRATING KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS FROM COMPUTER SCIENCE, MATHEMATICS, AND STATISTICS WITH AN APPLICATION DOMAIN, FROM WHICH THE DATA DRAW THEIR CONTEXT AND MEANING. DATA SCIENCE APPLICATIONS ARE RELEVANT FOR VARIOUS DOMAINS, AND THEREFORE, A VARIETY OF POPULATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY ATTRACTED TO LEARNING IT. ADDRESSING THE THEME OF THE CONFERENCE, I.E., 'WOMEN IN ENGINEERING', IN THIS PAPER WE DESCRIBE A DATA SCIENCE WORKSHOP FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES AND DIGITAL HUMANITIES RESEARCHERS. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY (83%) OF THE PARTICIPANTS OF THIS WORKSHOP SELF-IDENTIFIED AS WOMEN. THIS GENDER PROPORTION, THE OPPOSITE OF THAT PREVAILING IN STEM STUDIES, LED US TO EXAMINE THE WORKSHOP FROM A GENDER PERSPECTIVE. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN THE DATA SCIENCE WORKSHOP PERCEIVED IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE RESEARCH TOOLS RATHER THAN PROGRAMMING TOOLS. WE SUGGEST THAT FRAMING THE WORKSHOP AS A RESEARCH TOOL WORKSHOP AND NOT AS A PROGRAMMING WORKSHOP REDUCED PREVALENT GENDER BARRIERS IN STEM, ENCOURAGING A MAJORITY OF WOMEN RESEARCHERS TO PARTICIPATE. IN THIS PAPER, WE ELABORATE ON THE PARTICIPANTS' PERCEPTIONS ABOUT DATA SCIENCE AND PROGRAMMING AND ANALYZE THEM BASED ON THREE THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES: EXPECTANCY VALUE THEORY, THE INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE, AND THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE. © 2021 IEEE.","DATA SCIENCE; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; GENDER BALANCE; INTERDISCIPLINARY OF DATA SCIENCE","ENGINEERING EDUCATION; POPULATION STATISTICS; PROFESSIONAL ASPECTS; STEM (SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS); DIGITAL HUMANITIES; EXPECTANCY-VALUE THEORY; ORIENTED DOMAINS; PROGRAMMING TOOLS; SCIENCE , TECHNOLOGY , ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS; SCIENCE APPLICATIONS; SCIENCE WORKSHOPS; WOMEN IN ENGINEERING; DATA SCIENCE","","","BERMAN F.D., BOURNE P.E., LET'S MAKE GENDER DIVERSITY IN DATA SCIENCE A PRIORITY RIGHT FROM THE START, PLOS BIOLOGY, 13, 7, (2015); ECCLES J.S., WIGFIELD A., FROM EXPECTANCY-VALUE THEORY TO SITUATED EXPECTANCY-VALUE THEORY: A DEVELOPMENTAL, SOCIAL COGNITIVE, AND SOCIOCULTURAL PERSPECTIVE ON MOTIVATION, CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY, (2020); LATTUCA L.R., VOIGT L.J., FATH K.Q., DOES INTERDISCIPLINARITY PROMOTE LEARNING?

STUDENTS OF DATA SCIENCE AREA USUALLY FACE THE DIFFICULTY OF UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX OF REAL-TIME DATA AND SOPHISTICATED STATISTICAL INDICATORS AND MODELS. ANOTHER DIFFICULTY IS STUDENTS ARE EASY TO LOST INTERESTS AND PATIENCE DURING THE PROCESS OF LEARNING PROGRAMMING AND ANALYSIS PROCESS, SUCH AS R-LANGUAGE. STOCK MARKET, AS A HUGE DATA SOURCE AND AN IMPORTANT DATA DISCIPLINARY, IS COMPARATIVELY EASY TO ATTRACT STUDENT ATTENTIONS. THUS, WE DEVELOPED AN INTUITIVE TRADING PLATFORM FOR EDUCATION PURPOSE. THE PLATFORM CONTAINS THREE COMPONENTS: AN EXPLORING WINDOW, A CONTROL WINDOWS AND A REPORT WINDOW. THE EXPLORING WINDOW SHOWS CURRENT AND HISTORICAL STOCK PRICE TRENDS AND RELATED INDICATORS. SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVE STOCKS FROM DIFFERENT SECTORS CAN BE PICKED AND SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES CAN BE ASSIGNED. THE CONTROL WINDOW ALLOWS STUDENTS TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN TRADING STRATEGIES. A TRADING STRATEGY CAN BE CREATED BY EITHER INTUITIVE WAY, OR THROUGH SINGLE OR COMBINATIONS OF INDICATORS, OR BE BUILT GENERICALLY THOUGH PLUG-IN R-PROGRAMING MODULE. THE REPORT WINDOW DEMONSTRATES THE EXPECTED RETURN OF A STOCK IN A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME THROUGH A SPECIFIC STRATEGY. A MORE COMPREHENSIVE REPORT WITH DETAILED TRANSACTION INFORMATION IS ALSO PROVIDED FOR BACK-TESTING PURPOSE. STUDENTS ARE INVOLVED INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOFTWARE AND GET EXPERIENCE FOR R-PROGRAMMING. PRELIMINARY VERSION OF THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN TESTED AND SURVEYED IN A DATA SCIENCE CLASSROOM. ABOUT TEN JUNIOR DATA SCIENCE STUDENTS HAVE PRACTICED AND PROVIDED FEEDBACK. THE POSITIVE SURVEY RESULTS SHOW THE FEASIBILITY OF THE APPROACH. IN THE FUTURE, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT COMPONENT WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THE PLATFORM.  © 2020 IEEE.","DATA SCIENCE; R-PROGRAMMING; TRADING PLATFORM","COMMERCE; DATA SCIENCE; EDUCATION COMPUTING; ELECTRONIC TRADING; FINANCIAL MARKETS; SURVEYS; ANALYSIS PROCESS; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT; PROCESS OF LEARNING; SCIENCE CLASSROOM; SCIENCE EDUCATION; STATISTICAL INDICATORS; TRADING STRATEGIES; TRANSACTION INFORMATION; STUDENTS","","","METZ C., (2017); WLADAWSKY-BERGER I., THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, (2017); SEMENEY A., (2017); MACHINE LEARNING FOR STOCK TRADING STRATEGIES, (2016); GREG WALTERS S., (2017)","","INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC.","ENGLISH","PROC.

WE EXAMINED THE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO DATA WRANGLING PRACTICES BY INVESTIGATING YOUTH’S TALK-IN-INTERACTION WHILE ASSEMBLING MODELS AND STORIES ABOUT FAMILY MIGRATION USING INTERACTIVE DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS AND LARGE SOCIOECONOMIC DATASETS. WE FIRST IDENTIFIED TEN SOCIOTECHNICAL PRACTICES THAT CHARACTERIZE YOUTH’S INTERACTION WITH TOOLS AND COLLABORATION IN DATA WRANGLING. WE THEN SUGGEST FOUR CATEGORIES OF ACTIVITIES TO DESCRIBE PATTERNS OF LEARNING RELATED TO THE PRACTICES, INCLUDING ADDRESSING MISSING DATA, UNDERSTANDING DATA AGGREGATION, EXPLORING SOCIAL OR HISTORICAL EVENTS THAT CONSTITUTE THE FORMATION OF DATA PATTERNS, AND VARYING DATA VISUAL ENCODING FOR STORYTELLING. THESE PRACTICES AND ACTIVITIES ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND FOR SUPPORTING FUTURE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES THAT FACILITATE LEARNING AND DISCUSSION ABOUT SCIENTIFIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC ISSUES.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: CONTENT ANALYSIS OF RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS ON DATA SCIENCE WAS MADE OF PAPERS PUBLISHED IN THE WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN THEMES DISCUSSED IN THE PUBLICATIONS FROM THE LIS PERSPECTIVE. FINDINGS: A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF 80 PUBLICATIONS IS PRESENTED. THE ARTICLES BELONGED TO THE SIX BROAD CATEGORIES: DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING; KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS OF THE DATA PROFESSIONAL; THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS IN THE DATA SCIENCE MOVEMENT; TOOLS, TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE; DATA SCIENCE FROM THE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE; AND DATA SCIENCE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HEALTH SCIENCES. THE CATEGORY OF TOOLS, TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE WAS MOST ADDRESSED BY THE AUTHORS, FOLLOWED BY DATA SCIENCE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HEALTH SCIENCES, DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS OF THE DATA PROFESSIONAL. HOWEVER, SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS FELL INTO SEVERAL CATEGORIES BECAUSE THESE TOPICS WERE CLOSELY RELATED. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: ONLY PUBLICATION RECORDED IN THE WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE AND WITH THE TERM “DATA SCIENCE” IN THE TOPIC AREA WERE ANALYZED. THEREFORE, SEVERAL RELEVANT STUDIES ARE NOT DISCUSSED IN THIS PAPER THAT EITHER WERE RELATED TO OTHER KEYWORDS SUCH AS “E-SCIENCE”, “E-RESEARCH”, “DATA SERVICE”, “DATA CURATION”, “RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT” OR “SCIENTIFIC DATA MANAGEMENT” OR WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE.

PROJECT-BASED LEARNING (PBL) IS A WELL-KNOWN PEDAGOGICAL TOOL FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY EDUCATION. IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISH INTERDISCIPLINARY LEARNING, STUDENTS MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE IN EACH OF THE SEPARATE DISCIPLINES. USE OF CROSS-DISCIPLINARY TEAMS, FOR EXAMPLE, IS ONE WAY TO MAKE SURE A PROJECT TEAM INCLUDES SPECIALISTS IN ALL REQUIRED DISCIPLINES. THIS, HOWEVER, IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE. IN MANY CASES, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS WITHIN THE PROJECT TEAM IN ONE OR MORE OF THE PROJECT DOMAINS. SPECIFICALLY, IN OUR CASE, FOURTH-YEAR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS ARE WORKING IN PAIRS ON BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING PROJECTS, WHICH ARE EVIDENTLY INTERDISCIPLINARY IN NATURE. THE TEAMS, HOWEVER, ARE HOMOGENEOUS AND THE STUDENTS LACK THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL EXPERTISE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE SOLUTIONS APPLICABLE BY PHYSICIANS. FURTHERMORE, STUDENTS TEND TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS GAP ONLY IN THE ADVANCED PHASES OF THE PROJECT, AND SO CRITICAL PHASES, SUCH AS GOAL SETTING AND PLANNING, ARE PERFORMED WITHOUT THE REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE.

DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION HAS SEEN RAPID GROWTH OVER THE PAST DECADE. TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH HANDS-ON OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH REAL DATA, MANY DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS HAVE ADVOCATED FOR AND IMPLEMENTED EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE CURRICULUM, WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN IN A WIDE VARIETY OF LITERATURE TO HAVE MANY BENEFITS. MOST EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES IN STEM PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED THROUGH CAPSTONE AND ENGINEERING DESIGN COURSES; THIS IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY THE CASE IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS AS WELL WHERE SEVERAL UNIVERSITIES HAVE DEVELOPED DATA SCIENCE CAPSTONE PROGRAMS IN WHICH STUDENTS WORK WITH CLIENTS ON THE CLIENT'S REAL-WORLD DATA SETS. WHILE CLIENT-SPONSORED CAPSTONE PROJECTS ARE AN EXEMPLAR OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING, THEY MAY POSE MAJOR CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENT AND CAN BE PARTICULARLY RESOURCE-INTENSIVE FOR INSTITUTIONS; THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE CASE IN DATA SCIENCE WHERE THE LEGALITIES OF DATA SHARING MAY COME WITH ADDITIONAL HURDLES. BECAUSE OF THIS, WE WERE MOTIVATED TO DEVELOP A NOVEL CLIENT-FACING DATA SCIENCE CONSULTING COURSE THAT PROVIDES A UNIQUE EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING SCENARIO TO BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS WHILE REQUIRING MUCH FEWER RESOURCES AND LEGALITIES. IN OUR NOVEL DATA SCIENCE CONSULTING COURSE, GROUPS OF STUDENTS WORK DIRECTLY WITH REAL CLIENTS IN A CONSULTING CLINIC SETTING TO PROVIDE DATA SCIENCE GUIDANCE AND SHORT-TERM HELP WITH DATA SCIENCE CHALLENGES. THROUGH THIS PROCESS, STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS IN DATA SCIENCE, HOW TO LEAD CONSULTATIONS WITH CLIENTS EFFECTIVELY AS A TEAM, HOW TO FRAME DATA SCIENCE CHALLENGES AND RESEARCH POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS, AND HOW TO COMMUNICATE SOLUTIONS TO CLIENTS IN REPORTS AND PRESENTATIONS. WE LEVERAGED BEST PRACTICES IN CONSULTING COURSES DEVELOPED IN BUSINESS SCHOOL SETTINGS TO DESIGN OUR COURSE. ADDITIONALLY, THE CONSULTING COURSE SERVES AS A COMMUNITY SERVICE INITIATIVE WHEREBY RESEARCHERS, CLINICIANS, NON-PROFIT AND GOVERNMENT WORKERS, AND INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS BENEFIT FROM THE ADVICE AND SHORT-TERM HELP PROVIDED THROUGH CONSULTATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE REPORT HOW OUR CONSULTING COURSE IS SET UP, HOW CLIENTS FROM BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY CAN SEEK HELP AT THE CONSULTING CLINIC, AND HOW THE STRUCTURE OF THE COURSE ENABLES STUDENTS TO HAVE FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE WORKING ON MANY REAL-WORLD DATA SCIENCE PROBLEMS WITH CLIENTS. FINALLY, WE DISCUSS HOW STUDENT PERFORMANCE IS ASSESSED IN THIS COURSE, THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM OFFERING THIS COURSE, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OTHER DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS IN UNIVERSITIES THAT WISH TO DESIGN SIMILAR COURSES. © 2022 IEEE.","CONSULTING COURSE; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING","DATA SCIENCE; FACINGS; STUDENTS; CAPSTONE PROJECTS; CONSULTING COURSE; CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING; INNOVATIVE PRACTICES; LEARNING OPPORTUNITY; REAL-WORLD; SCIENCE EDUCATION; SCIENCE PROJECTS; CURRICULA","","","ANDERSON P., BOWRING J., MCCAULEY R., POTHERING G., STARR C., AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN DATA SCIENCE: CURRICULUM AND A DECADE OF IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 45TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, SER.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS A HIGHLY INNOVATIVE COURSE IN A UK UNIVERSITY THAT INTRODUCES UNDERGRADUATE MEDICAL STUDENTS TO DATA SCIENCE. IT ALSO DISCUSSES A STUDY ON STUDENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE LEARNING AND TEACHING OF HEALTH DATA SCIENCE. METHODS: THE PEDAGOGICAL DESIGN ELEMENTS OF THE DATA SCIENCE IN MEDICINE COURSE ARE DISCUSSED, ALONG WITH ITS SYLLABUS, ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY AND FLIPPED CLASSROOM DELIVERY. THE COURSE HAS BEEN OFFERED TO APPROXIMATELY 630 STUDENTS OVER THREE YEARS. STUDENT PERSPECTIVES WERE INVESTIGATED THROUGH THREE FOCUS GROUPS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF 19 STUDENTS ACROSS DIFFERENT STUDY YEARS IN MEDICINE. AN EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED REGARDING INSTRUCTOR-LED VS. VIDEO-BASED MODALITIES OF ONLINE PROGRAMMING LABS, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF 8 STUDENTS. RESULTS: THE COURSE HAS LED TO IMPROVED DATA COMPETENCY AMONG MEDICAL STUDENTS AND TO A POSITIVE CHANGE IN THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT DATA SCIENCE. MOTIVATING THE COURSE AND SHOWING RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES. STATISTICS WAS PERCEIVED BY FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS AS AN ESSENTIAL DATA SKILL. INCLUDING DATA SCIENCE IN THE MEDICAL CURRICULUM WAS PERCEIVED AS IMPORTANT BY YEAR 1 STUDENTS, WHILE OPINIONS VARIED BETWEEN YEAR 4/5 PARTICIPANTS. VIDEO-BASED ONLINE LABS WERE PREFERRED OVER INSTRUCTOR-LED ONLINE LABS, AND THEY WERE FOUND TO BE MORE USEFUL AND ENJOYABLE, WITHOUT LEADING TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. CONCLUSIONS: TEACHING DATA SCIENCE TO UNDERGRADUATE MEDICINE STUDENTS IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE AND FEASIBLE. WE RECOMMEND INCLUDING STATISTICS IN THE CURRICULUM AND PRACTICAL SKILL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH SIMPLE AND CLINICALLY-RELEVANT DATA SCIENCE TASKS, SUPPORTED THROUGH VIDEO-BASED ONLINE LABS. FURTHER REPORTING ON SIMILAR COURSES IS NEEDED, AS WELL AS LARGER-SCALE STUDIES ON STUDENT PERSPECTIVES. © 2022 ELSEVIER B.V.","DATA SCIENCE; EDUCATION; HEALTH; HEALTH INFORMATICS; MEDICINE; TRAINING","CURRICULUM; DATA SCIENCE; EDUCATION, MEDICAL, UNDERGRADUATE; HUMANS; LEARNING; STUDENTS, MEDICAL; UNIVERSITIES; CURRICULA; DATA SCIENCE; LABORATORIES; MEDICAL EDUCATION; MEDICINE; STUDENTS; TEACHING; FOCUS GROUPS; HEALTH DATA; HEALTH INFORMATICS; LEARNING AND TEACHINGS; MEDICAL CURRICULUM; MEDICAL STUDENTS; ONLINE LABS; SCIENCE EDUCATION; STUDENT PERSPECTIVES; TEACHING PRACTICES; ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT; ADULT; ARTICLE; CLINICAL PRACTICE; CURRICULUM; DATA SCIENCE; FEMALE; HEALTH DATA; HUMAN; HUMAN EXPERIMENT; LEARNING; MAJOR CLINICAL STUDY; MALE; MEDICAL INFORMATICS; MEDICAL STUDENT; SKILL; TEACHING; VIDEORECORDING; MEDICAL EDUCATION; MEDICAL STUDENT; UNIVERSITY; MEDICAL INFORMATICS","MEDICAL SCHOOL; UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH, ED","THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE USHER INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH FOR FUNDING THIS WORK THROUGH AN USHER EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT GRANT.

AS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE IT INTEGRATES KNOWLEDGE AND METHODS FROM COMPUTER SCIENCE, MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS, AND THE DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE OF THE DATA. AS DATA SCIENCE IS STILL FORMING AS A DOMAIN, SEVERAL POINTS OF VIEW EXIST ON HOW TO TEACH DATA SCIENCE. THE CURRICULUM OF MANY UNDERGRADUATE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS INCLUDES ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN MATHEMATICS, STATISTICS, COMPUTER SCIENCE, AND ONE OR MORE DATA DOMAINS. SEVERAL INITIATIVES FOR DESIGNING HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE CURRICULA HAVE EMERGED RECENTLY. SINCE IT IS UNREALISTIC TO TEACH ALL THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ADVANCED TOPICS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL, THE HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM FOCUSES ON A BROAD UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW RATHER THAN ON MATHEMATICAL AND ALGORITHMIC DETAILS THAT CHARACTERIZE UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS.

THE APPLICATION OF DESIGN THINKING HAS BEEN WITNESSED TO BE THE ROAD TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS, INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS, SCIENTIFIC SOFTWARE, HEALTHCARE APPLICATION, AND EVEN TO UTILIZE DESIGN THINKING TO RE-THINK BUSINESS OPERATION AS THE CASE OF AIRBNB.

IN INVOKING EXPONENTIAL GROWTH, MATHEMATICAL MODELLING, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, AND THE LIKE, THESE DATA VISUALIZATIONS INVITE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MATHEMATICS TEACHING AND LEARNING. YET DATA VISUALIZATIONS ARE SOCIAL TEXTS, AUTHORED FROM SPECIFIC POINTS OF VIEW, THAT NARRATE PARTICULAR, AND OFTEN CONSEQUENTIAL, STORIES. THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RELIANCE ON QUANTIFICATION AND MATHEMATICS CEMENTS THEIR SOCIAL POSITIONING AS SUPPOSEDLY OBJECTIVE, RELIABLE, AND NEUTRAL. THE READING OF ANY DATA VISUALIZATION DEMANDS UNPACKING THE ROLE OF MATHEMATICS, INCLUDING HOW DATA AND VARIABLES HAVE BEEN FORMATTED AND HOW RELATIONSHIPS ARE FRAMED TO NARRATE STORIES FROM PARTICULAR POINTS OF VIEW. WE PRESENT AN APPROACH TO A CRITICAL READING OF DATA VISUALIZATIONS FOR THE CONTEXT OF MATHEMATICS EDUCATION THAT DRAWS ON THREE INTERRELATED CONCEPTS: MATHEMATICAL FORMATTING (WHAT GETS QUANTIFIED, MEASURED, AND HOW), FRAMING (HOW VARIABLES ARE RELATED AND THROUGH WHAT KIND OF DATA VISUALIZATION), AND NARRATING (WHICH STORIES THE DATA VISUALIZATION TELLS, ITS POTENTIAL IMPACTS AND LIMITS). THIS APPROACH TO READING DATA VISUALISATIONS INCLUDES A PROCESS OF REIMAGINING THROUGH REFORMATTING, REFRAMING AND RENARRATING. WE ILLUSTRATE THIS APPROACH AND THESE THREE CONCEPTS USING DATA VISUALIZATIONS PUBLISHED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES IN 2020 ABOUT COVID-19.

NEW DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE BEING LAUNCHED AT AN INCREASING RATE, ARE DESIGNED FOR MULTIPLE EDUCATION LEVELS AND POPULATIONS. MACHINE LEARNING (ML) IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF DATA SCIENCE THAT REQUIRES AN EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND IN MATHEMATICS. WHEREAS IT IS POSSIBLE TO TEACH THE PRINCIPLES OF ML ONLY AS A BLACK BOX, NOVICE LEARNERS MIGHT FIND IT DIFFICULT TO IMPROVE AN ALGORITHM’S PERFORMANCE WITHOUT A WHITE BOX UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING ML ALGORITHMS. IN THIS PAPER, WE SUGGEST A PEDAGOGICAL METHOD, BASED ON HANDS-ON PEN-AND-PAPER TASKS, TO SUPPORT WHITE BOX UNDERSTANDING OF ML ALGORITHMS FOR LEARNERS WHO LACK THE LEVEL OF MATHEMATICS KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED FOR THIS PURPOSE. DATA WERE COLLECTED USING A COMPREHENSION QUESTIONNAIRE AND ANALYZED ACCORDING TO THE PROCESS-OBJECT THEORY BORROWED FROM MATHEMATICS EDUCATION RESEARCH. WE PRESENT EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS METHOD BASED ON DATA COLLECTED IN AN INTRODUCTION-LEVEL DATA SCIENCE COURSE FOR GRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS.

IN DATA SCIENCES, THERE ARE TWO RELATED BUT DISTINCT STRATEGIES: HYPOTHESIS TESTING AND BINARY CLASSIFICATION. IN PRACTICE, HOW TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THESE TWO STRATEGIES CAN BE UNCLEAR AND RATHER CONFUSING. HERE, WE SUMMARIZE KEY DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THESE TWO STRATEGIES IN THREE ASPECTS AND LIST FIVE PRACTICAL GUIDELINES FOR DATA ANALYSTS TO CHOOSE THE APPROPRIATE STRATEGY FOR SPECIFIC ANALYSIS NEEDS. WE DEMONSTRATE THE USE OF THOSE GUIDELINES IN A CANCER DRIVER GENE PREDICTION EXAMPLE. IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, TWO ANALYSIS STRATEGIES, HYPOTHESIS TESTING AND BINARY CLASSIFICATION, ARE MOSTLY COVERED IN DIFFERENT COURSES AND TEXTBOOKS. IN REAL DATA APPLICATION, IT CAN BE PUZZLING WHETHER A BINARY DECISION PROBLEM SHOULD BE FORMULATED AS HYPOTHESIS TESTING OR BINARY CLASSIFICATION. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DISENTANGLE THE PUZZLE FOR DATA SCIENCE STUDENTS AND RESEARCHERS BY OFFERING PRACTICAL GUIDELINES FOR CHOOSING BETWEEN THE TWO STRATEGIES. HYPOTHESIS TESTING AND BINARY CLASSIFICATION ARE TWO DATA ANALYSIS STRATEGIES TAUGHT MOSTLY IN DIFFERENT UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES AND RARELY COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER. AS A RESULT, WHICH STRATEGY IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR A SPECIFIC REAL-WORLD DATA ANALYSIS TASK IS OFTEN AMBIGUOUS. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, THIS PERSPECTIVE ARTICLE CLARIFIES THE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO STRATEGIES AND OFFERS PRACTICAL GUIDELINES TO THE BROAD DATA SCIENCE DISCIPLINE. © 2020 THE AUTHOR(S)","DSML 1: CONCEPT: BASIC PRINCIPLES OF A NEW DATA SCIENCE OUTPUT OBSERVED AND REPORTED","DATA HANDLING; INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH; MACHINE LEARNING; TESTING; ANALYSIS STRATEGIES; BINARY CLASSIFICATION; HYPOTHESIS TESTING; PRACTICAL GUIDELINES; SCIENCE DISCIPLINES; SCIENCE EDUCATION; SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES; STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS TESTING; DATA SCIENCE","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, (1846216)","","LEHMANN E.L., ROMANO J.P., TESTING STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES, (2006); MURPHY K.P., MACHINE LEARNING: A PROBABILISTIC PERSPECTIVE, (2012); WASSERMAN L., ALL OF STATISTICS: A CONCISE COURSE IN STATISTICAL INFERENCE, (2013); DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN TWO GROUPS IN STATISTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING: HYPOTHESIS TEST VS.

INNOVATION, COMPUTATION, AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES HAVE NOW TREMENDOUSLY ACCELERATED THE PACE OF DISCOVERY, PROVIDING DRIVERLESS CARS, ROBOTIC DEVICES, EXPERT HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, PRECISION MEDICINE, AND AUTOMATED DISCOVERY TO MENTION A FEW. EVEN THOUGH THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM DATA SCIENCE CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, THE SWEEPING IMPACT IT HAS ALREADY PRODUCED ON SOCIETY IS UNDENIABLE. WE ARE AT A POINT WHEN NEW DISCOVERIES THROUGH DATA SCIENCE HAVE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL TO ADVANCE PROGRESS BUT ALSO TO BE USED MALICIOUSLY, WITH HARMFUL ETHICAL AND SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES. PERHAPS NOWHERE IS THIS MORE CLEARLY EXEMPLIFIED THAN IN THE BIOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL SCIENCES. THE CONFLUENCE OF (1) MACHINE LEARNING, (2) MATHEMATICAL MODELING, (3) COMPUTATION/SIMULATION, AND (4) BIG DATA HAVE MOVED US FROM THE SEQUENCING OF GENOMES TO GENE EDITING AND INDIVIDUALIZED MEDICINE; YET, UNSETTLED POLICIES REGARDING DATA PRIVACY AND ETHICAL NORMS COULD POTENTIALLY OPEN DOORS FOR SERIOUS NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS. THE DATA SCIENCE REVOLUTION HAS AMPLIFIED THE URGENT NEED FOR A PARADIGM SHIFT IN UNDERGRADUATE BIOLOGY EDUCATION. IT HAS REAFFIRMED THAT DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION INTERACTS AND ENHANCES MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION IN ADVANCING QUANTITATIVE CONCEPTUAL AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT FOR THE NEW GENERATION OF BIOLOGISTS. THESE CONNECTIONS ENCOURAGE US TO STRIVE TO CULTIVATE A BROADLY SKILLED WORKFORCE OF TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY PROBLEM-SOLVERS, SKILLED AT HANDLING THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES PERTAINING TO BIOLOGICAL DATA, AND CAPABLE OF COLLABORATING ACROSS VARIOUS DISCIPLINES IN THE SCIENCES, THE HUMANITIES, AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, WE SUGGEST DEVELOPMENT OF OPEN CURRICULA THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE JOB CERTIFICATION RHETORIC AND COMBINE DATA ACUMEN WITH MODELING, EXPERIMENTAL, AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS THROUGH ENGAGING PROJECTS, WHILE ALSO PROVIDING AWARENESS AND DEEP EXPLORATION OF THEIR SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS. THIS PROCESS WOULD BENEFIT FROM EMBRACING THE PEDAGOGY OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING AND INVOLVE STUDENTS IN OPEN-ENDED EXPLORATIONS DERIVED FROM AUTHENTIC INQUIRIES AND ONGOING RESEARCH. ON THIS FOUNDATION, WE ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT OF FLEXIBLE DATA SCIENCE INITIATIVES FOR THE EDUCATION OF LIFE SCIENCE UNDERGRADUATES WITHIN AND ACROSS EXISTING MODELS. © 2020, SOCIETY FOR MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY.","BIG DATA; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; EDUCATION REFORM; MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY EDUCATION","COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY; CURRICULUM; DATA SCIENCE; HUMANS; BIOLOGY; CURRICULUM; EDUCATION; HUMAN","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, (-1300426); NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF; UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, UT","THE FIRST AUTHOR WAS PARTIALLY SUPPORTED BY THE KARL PEACE FELLOWSHIP IN MATHEMATICS, RANDOLPH-MACON COLLEGE, VA.

IN THE WORLD OF THE 21ST CENTURY PEOPLE WHO ARE DATA ILLITERATE, WILL INCREASINGLY FIND THEMSELVES IN THE SAME SITUATION, IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR FIELD OF EMPLOYMENT. COMPANIES AND SOCIETY NEED PEOPLE WHO CAN ANALYSE DATA AND USE THE RESULTING INFORMATION TO DIRECT DECISIONS. ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE 21ST CENTURY THAT SOCIETY STRUGGLES WITH, IS THE INCREASING PREVALENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS DUE TO WORK PRESSURES, FAILING MARRIAGES, TORN FAMILY STRUCTURES, ISOLATION AND SO FORTH. THE MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDENTS IS A MAJOR CAUSE FOR CONCERN SINCE ONE IN THREE STUDENTS SHOW SIGNS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. WITHIN THIS CONTEXT THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO ADDRESS THE INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN FOR DATA SCIENCE STUDENTS. THEY NEED TO LEARN RELEVANT CONTENT IN A MANNER THAT WILL EQUIP THEM TO SUCCEED IN THE WORKPLACE AND SOCIETY AT LARGE WITHIN A CONTEXT WHERE THEIR WELLBEING WILL BE NURTURED. THE STUDY EMPLOYS THE SYSTEMS INFORMED POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY PERSPECTIVE TO DIRECT THE PROCESS OF IMPROVING THE DESIGN OF DATA SCIENCE MODULES. CRITICAL SYSTEMS THINKING DETERMINES HOW DIFFERENT COMPONENTS ARE INTERLINKED, AND HOW THEY CAN BEST BE CHANGED TO ATTAIN THE OVERALL GOAL BY LISTENING TO THE VOICES OF ALL THE AFFECTED PARTIES. DIRECTED CONTENT ANALYSIS OF COMMENTS RECEIVED FROM 284 STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN AN INTRODUCTORY STATISTICS MODULE AT A SOUTH AFRICAN UNIVERSITY INDICATES THAT STUDENTS INTUITIVELY MENTIONED SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE FLOURISHING CLASSROOMS SYSTEMS MODEL, THEREBY INDICATING THAT STUDENTS WOULD LIKE A THRIVING CLASSROOM. THE STUDENTS' VOICE INDICATED THAT THINGS LIKE EMOTIONAL BONDING AND SUPPORTIVENESS ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM. LITTLE CLASSROOM FLEXIBILITY IS EXPERIENCED BY THE STUDENTS, IT MAY BE DUE TO LECTURERS WHO ARE LACKING IN LEADERSHIP IN THE CLASSROOM AND ARE UNWILLING TO NEGOTIATE ON MATTERS WITH THE STUDENTS. STUDENTS INDICATED THE IMPORTANCE OF PROPER CLASSROOM COMMUNICATION - CLARITY AND LISTENER SKILLS ARE CRUCIAL FOR STUDENTS TO FLOURISH IN A CLASS. FINALLY, SEVERAL ASPECTS OF CLASSROOM WELLBEING WERE MENTIONED: STRENGTH FOCUS RATHER THAN ZOOMING IN ON SHORTCOMINGS, LECTURERS' EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT, STUDENTS' INCREASED ATTENTION THROUGH ACTIVE LEARNING, IMPROVED COPING THROUGH BETTER PLANNING AND TIME MANAGEMENT, AND THE FORMING OF GOOD STUDY HABITS. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT BY EMPLOYING SYSTEMS THINKING, THE INTER-CONNECTEDNESS OF DIVERSE FACTORS EMERGED MORE CLEARLY, ENABLING EDUCATIONISTS TO DEVELOP BETTER SOLUTIONS THAT MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF MANY STUDENTS. © ISSS 2022.","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; FLOURISHING CLASSROOM; POSITIVE EDUCATION; SYSTEMS INFORMED POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY","DATA SCIENCE; DISEASES; EDUCATION COMPUTING; SYSTEMS THINKING; CRITICAL SYSTEMS THINKING; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; FLOURISHING CLASSROOM; MENTAL ILLNESS; POSITIVE EDUCATION; POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY; SCIENCE EDUCATION; SYSTEM INFORMED POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY; WELLBEING; WORK PRESSURES; STUDENTS","","","ALLISON L., WATERS L., KERN M.

DATA SCIENCE IS A NEW EMERGING DISCIPLINE THAT WAS TERMED TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE FACING AND GOING TO FACE IN THE BIG DATA ERA. THUS, EDUCATION IN DATA SCIENCE IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS, AND WE NEED CONCRETE STRATEGIES AND APPROACHES TO BETTER EDUCATE FUTURE DATA SCIENTISTS.

THIS NEW FIELD REQUIRES A WIDE RANGE OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS FROM DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES INCLUDING MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS, COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PRESENT THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY THAT EXPLORED THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE FROM THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE (LIS) PERSPECTIVE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: ANALYSIS OF RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS ON DATA SCIENCE WAS MADE ON THE BASIS OF PAPERS PUBLISHED IN THE WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE. THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS WERE PROPOSED: WHAT ARE THE MAIN TENDENCIES IN PUBLICATION YEARS, DOCUMENT TYPES, COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN, SOURCE TITLES, AUTHORS OF PUBLICATIONS, AFFILIATIONS OF THE ARTICLE AUTHORS AND THE MOST CITED ARTICLES RELATED TO DATA SCIENCE IN THE FIELD OF LIS? WHAT ARE THE MAIN THEMES DISCUSSED IN THE PUBLICATIONS FROM THE LIS PERSPECTIVE? FINDINGS: THE HIGHEST CONTRIBUTION TO DATA SCIENCE COMES FROM THE COMPUTER SCIENCE RESEARCH COMMUNITY. THE CONTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND LIBRARY SCIENCE COMMUNITY IS QUITE SMALL. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN CONTINUOUS INCREASE IN ARTICLES FROM THE YEAR 2015. THE MAIN DOCUMENT TYPES ARE JOURNAL ARTICLES, FOLLOWED BY CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS AND EDITORIAL MATERIAL. THE TOP THREE JOURNALS THAT PUBLISH DATA SCIENCE PAPERS FROM THE LIS PERSPECTIVE ARE THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION, THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND THE JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. THE TOP FIVE COUNTRIES PUBLISHING ARE USA, CHINA, ENGLAND, AUSTRALIA AND INDIA. THE MOST CITED ARTICLE HAS GOT 112 CITATIONS. THE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE DATA SCIENCE FIELD IS QUITE INTERDISCIPLINARY BY NATURE. IN ADDITION TO THE FIELD OF LIS THE PAPERS BELONGED TO SEVERAL OTHER RESEARCH AREAS. THE REVIEWED ARTICLES BELONGED TO THE SIX BROAD CATEGORIES: DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING; KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS OF THE DATA PROFESSIONAL; THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS IN THE DATA SCIENCE MOVEMENT; TOOLS, TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE; DATA SCIENCE FROM THE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE; AND DATA SCIENCE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HEALTH SCIENCES. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS RESEARCH ARE THAT THIS STUDY ONLY ANALYZED RESEARCH PAPERS IN THE WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE AND THEREFORE ONLY COVERS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SCIENTIFIC PAPERS PUBLISHED IN THE FIELD OF LIS. IN ADDITION, ONLY PUBLICATIONS WITH THE TERM “DATA SCIENCE” IN THE TOPIC AREA OF THE WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE WERE ANALYZED. THEREFORE, SEVERAL RELEVANT STUDIES ARE NOT DISCUSSED IN THIS PAPER THAT ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE OR WERE RELATED TO OTHER KEYWORDS SUCH AS “E-SCIENCE,” “E-RESEARCH,” “DATA SERVICE,” “DATA CURATION” OR “RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT.” ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED USING BIBLIOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF PUBLICATIONS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE LIS. THIS PAPER HELPS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE AND THE PERSPECTIVES FOR INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS. © 2019, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.","BIBLIOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS; BUSINESS VALUE; DATA MANAGEMENT; DATA SCIENCE; DATA SCIENTIST; INFORMATION SCIENCE; IOT; LIBRARY SCIENCE; LITERATURE REVIEW; SKILLS","DATA SCIENCE; DATABASE SYSTEMS; INTERNET OF THINGS; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; PUBLISHING; BIBLIOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS; BUSINESS VALUE; DATA SCIENTIST; DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH; IOT; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE; LIBRARY SCIENCE; LITERATURE REVIEWS; SKILL; WEB OF SCIENCE; LIBRARIES","","","AGARWAL R., DHAR V., BIG DATA, DATA SCIENCE, AND ANALYTICS: THE OPPORTUNITY AND CHALLENGE FOR IS RESEARCH, INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH, 25, 3, PP. 443-448, (2014); AKERKAR R., SAJJA P.S., INTELLIGENT TECHNIQUES FOR DATA SCIENCE, (2016); AMIRIAN P., VAN LOGGERENBERG F., LANG T., DATA SCIENCE AND ANALYTICS, BIG DATA IN HEALTHCARE, SPRINGERBRIEFS IN PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE & DRUG DEVELOPMENT, PP. 15-37, (2017); ANTELL K., FOOTE J.B., TURNER J., SHULTS B., DEALING WITH DATA: SCIENCE LIBRARIANS’ PARTICIPATION IN DATA MANAGEMENT AT ASSOCIATION OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES INSTITUTIONS, COLLEGE & RESEARCH LIBRARIES, 75, 4, PP. 557-574, (2014); ARISTODEMOU L., TIETZE F., THE STATE-OF-THE-ART ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ANALYTICS (IPA): A LITERATURE REVIEW ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING METHODS FOR ANALYSING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) DATA, WORLD PATENT INFORMATION, 55, PP. 37-51, (2018); BASKARADA S., KORONIOS A., UNICORN DATA SCIENTIST: THE RAREST OF BREEDS, PROGRAM, 51, 1, PP. 65-74, (2017); BELL G., HEY T., SZALAY A., BEYOND THE DATA DELUGE, SCIENCE, 323, 5919, PP. 1297-1298, (2009); BERTOLUCCI J., ARE YOU RECRUITING A DATA SCIENTIST OR A UNICORN?, (2013); BORGMAN C.L., BIG DATA, LITTLE DATA, NO DATA: SCHOLARSHIP IN THE NETWORKED WORLD, (2015); BRUNNER R.J., KIM E.J., TEACHING DATA SCIENCE, PROCEDIA COMPUTER SCIENCE, 80, PP. 1947-1956, (2016); CADY F., THE DATA SCIENCE HANDBOOK, (2017); CAO L., DATA SCIENCE THINKING: THE NEXT SCIENTIFIC, TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, (2018); CARTER D., SHOLLER D., DATA SCIENCE ON THE GROUND: HYPE, CRITICISM, AND EVERYDAY WORK, JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, 67, 10, PP. 2309-2319, (2016); CERVONE H.F., INFORMATICS AND DATA SCIENCE: AN OVERVIEW FOR THE INFORMATION PROFESSIONAL, DIGITAL LIBRARY PERSPECTIVES, 32, 1, PP. 7-10, (2016); CHATFIELD A.T., SHLEMOON V.N., REDUBLADO W., RAHMAN F., DATA SCIENTISTS AS GAME CHANGERS IN BIG DATA ENVIRONMENTS, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 25TH AUSTRALASIAN CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AUCKLAND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, PP. 1-11, (2014); CHEN C.P., ZHANG C.-Y., DATA-INTENSIVE APPLICATIONS, CHALLENGES, TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES: A SURVEY ON BIG DATA, INFORMATION SCIENCES, 275, PP. 314-347, (2014); CLEVELAND W.S., DATA SCIENCE: AN ACTION PLAN FOR EXPANDING THE TECHNICAL AREAS OF THE FIELD OF STATISTICS, INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW, 69, 1, PP. 21-26, (2001); COSTA C., SANTOS M.Y., THE DATA SCIENTIST PROFILE AND ITS REPRESENTATIVENESS IN THE EUROPEAN E-COMPETENCE FRAMEWORK AND THE SKILLS FRAMEWORK FOR THE INFORMATION AGE, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, 37, 6, PP. 726-734, (2017); CUKIER K., MAYER-SCHONBERGER V., THE RISE OF BIG DATA: HOW IT’S CHANGING THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT THE WORLD, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 92, 3, PP. 28-40, (2013); DAVENPORT T.H., PATIL D.J., DATA SCIENTIST: THE SEXIEST JOB OF THE 21ST CENTURY, HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW, 90, 5, PP. 70-76, (2012); DEMCHENKO Y., BELLOUM A., WIKTORSKI T., EDISON DATA SCIENCE FRAMEWORK: PART 1.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: THE FEATURES OF TWO ONLINE DATA SCIENCE PLATFORMS ARE OUTLINED. BOTH ARE USEFUL FOR NEW DATA PROJECTS AND BOTH ARE INTEGRATED WITH COMMON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS. ONE PLATFORM FOCUSES MORE ON DATA EXPLORATION AND THE OTHER FOCUSES ON CONTAINERIZING, VISUALIZATION, AND SHARING CODE REPOSITORIES. RESULTS: BOTH DATA SCIENCE PLATFORMS ARE OPEN, FREE, AND ALLOW FOR COLLABORATION. BOTH ARE CAPABLE OF VISUAL, DESCRIPTIVE, AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS DISCUSSION: DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION BENEFITS BY HAVING AFFORDABLE OPEN AND COLLABORATIVE PLATFORMS TO CONDUCT A VARIETY OF DATA ANALYSES. CONCLUSION: OPEN COLLABORATIVE DATA SCIENCE PLATFORMS ARE PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR TEACHING DATA SCIENCE SKILLS TO CLINICAL AND NONCLINICAL INFORMATICS STUDENTS. COMMERCIAL DATA SCIENCE PLATFORMS EXIST BUT ARE COST-PROHIBITIVE AND GENERALLY LIMITED TO SPECIFIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES. © THE AUTHOR(S) 2018.

SUCH REPRODUCIBILITY CRISIS IN SCIENCE COULD SEVERELY UNDERMINE PUBLIC TRUST IN SCIENCE AND SCIENCE-BASED PUBLIC POLICY. RECENT EFFORTS TO PROMOTE REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH MAINLY FOCUSED ON MATURED SCIENTISTS AND MUCH LESS ON STUDENT TRAINING. IN THIS STUDY, WE CONDUCTED ACTION RESEARCH ON STUDENTS IN DATA SCIENCE TO EVALUATE TO WHAT EXTENT STUDENTS ARE READY FOR COMMUNICATING REPRODUCIBLE DATA ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ALTHOUGH TWO-THIRDS OF THE STUDENTS CLAIMED THEY WERE ABLE TO REPRODUCE RESULTS IN PEER REPORTS, ONLY ONE-THIRD OF REPORTS PROVIDED ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION FOR REPLICATION. THE ACTUAL REPLICATION RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE CONFLICTING CLAIMS; SOME LACKED COMPARISONS OF ORIGINAL AND REPLICATION RESULTS, INDICATING THAT SOME STUDENTS DID NOT SHARE A CONSISTENT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT REPRODUCIBILITY MEANS AND HOW TO REPORT REPLICATION RESULTS.

A GAP REMAINS, HOWEVER, BETWEEN THE COMPUTATIONAL SKILLS REQUIRED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STATISTICS IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND THOSE TAUGHT IN STATISTICS COURSES. THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY EXAMINES HOW FIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE GRADUATE STUDENTS AT ONE INSTITUTION EXPERIENCE THE PHENOMENON OF ACQUIRING THE COMPUTATIONAL SKILLS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT STATISTICS IN THEIR RESEARCH AND THE FACTORS THAT FOSTER OR INHIBIT LEARNING. IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS REVEALED THREE THEMES IN THESE STUDENTS' PATHS TOWARDS COMPUTATIONAL KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION: USE OF PEER SUPPORT, SEEKING OUT A SINGULAR ""CONSULTANT, "" AND LEARNING THROUGH INDEPENDENT RESEARCH EXPERIENCES.

SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, AND EXECUTIVES ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER ENORMOUS VOLUMES OF DATA, AND NEW TECHNIQUES AND TOOLS ARE EMERGING TO CREATE KNOWLEDGE OUT OF THESE DATA, SOME OF THEM CAPABLE OF WORKING WITH REAL-TIME STREAMS OF DATA. THE NATION'S ABILITY TO MAKE USE OF THESE DATA DEPENDS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF AN EDUCATED WORKFORCE WITH NECESSARY EXPERTISE. WITH THESE NEW CAPABILITIES HAVE COME NOVEL ETHICAL CHALLENGES REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND APPROPRIATENESS OF BROAD APPLICATIONS OF DATA ANALYSES. THE FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE HAS EMERGED TO ADDRESS THE PROLIFERATION OF DATA AND THE NEED TO MANAGE AND UNDERSTAND IT. DATA SCIENCE IS A HYBRID OF MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES AND SKILL SETS, DRAWS ON DIVERSE FIELDS (INCLUDING COMPUTER SCIENCE, STATISTICS, AND MATHEMATICS), ENCOMPASSES TOPICS IN ETHICS AND PRIVACY, AND DEPENDS ON SPECIFICS OF THE DOMAINS TO WHICH IT IS APPLIED. FUELED BY THE EXPLOSION OF DATA, JOBS THAT INVOLVE DATA SCIENCE HAVE PROLIFERATED AND AN ARRAY OF DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS AT THE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE LEVELS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED. NEVERTHELESS, DATA SCIENCE IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY, WHICH SUGGESTS THE IMPORTANCE OF ENVISIONING WHAT THE FIELD MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE AND WHAT KEY STEPS CAN BE TAKEN NOW TO MOVE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IN THAT DIRECTION. THIS STUDY WILL SET FORTH A VISION FOR THE EMERGING DISCIPLINE OF DATA SCIENCE AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL. THIS INTERIM REPORT LAYS OUT SOME OF THE INFORMATION AND COMMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS GATHERED AND HEARD DURING THE FIRST HALF OF ITS STUDY, OFFERS PERSPECTIVES ON THE CURRENT STATE OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, AND POSES SOME QUESTIONS THAT MAY SHAPE THE WAY DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION EVOLVES IN THE FUTURE. THE STUDY WILL CONCLUDE IN EARLY 2018 WITH A FINAL REPORT THAT LAYS OUT A VISION FOR FUTURE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. © 2018 BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.

SKILLFULLY USING DATA SCIENCE TOOLS THAT MANAGE THIS COMPLEXITY REQUIRES TRAINING IN NEW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND FRAMEWORKS AS WELL AS IMMERSION IN NEW MODES OF INTERACTION THAT FOSTER DATA SHARING, COLLABORATIVE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, AND EXCHANGE ACROSS DISCIPLINES. LEARNING THESE SKILLS FROM TRADITIONAL UNIVERSITY CURRICULA CAN BE CHALLENGING BECAUSE MOST COURSES ARE NOT DESIGNED TO EVOLVE ON TIME SCALES THAT CAN KEEP PACE WITH RAPIDLY SHIFTING DATA SCIENCE METHODS. HERE, WE PRESENT THE CONCEPT OF A HACK WEEK AS AN EFFECTIVE MODEL OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES FOR NETWORKING AND COMMUNITY BUILDING, EDUCATION IN STATE-OF-THE-ART DATA SCIENCE METHODS, AND IMMERSION IN COLLABORATIVE PROJECT WORK.

THE UNIVERSITY TEACHING FAVORS EFFECTIVE TEACHING TECHNIQUES INSTEAD OF CONVENTIONAL TEACHING METHODS, AND THE SAME TOPICS ARE TAUGHT TO PARTICIPANTS FROM LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AS SHORTER VERSIONS. THE ORGANIZATIONS ALSO HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CALIBRATING THE TEACHING VIA DISCUSSIONS AND MATURITY REVIEWS.

ONE PROMISING PHENOMENON INVESTIGATED IN RELATED WORK IS PERSPECTIVE-TAKING. A FIRST-PERSON “ACTOR” PERSPECTIVE CAN HELP FACILITATE GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL SENSEMAKING BY MEDIATING OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS TAKEN BY LEARNERS. HERE WE INVESTIGATE HOW MUSEUM VISITORS MADE USE OF AN ACTOR PERSPECTIVE WHEN EXPLORING AN OPEN-ENDED, INTERACTIVE DATA MAP MUSEUM EXHIBIT. WE USE A MIX OF QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE EMPIRICAL METHODS TO EXPLORE HOW ACTOR PERSPECTIVE-TAKING (APT) MAY MEDIATE JOINT SENSEMAKING AROUND DATA VISUALIZATIONS. BY APPLYING INTERPRETIVE CODING TO 54 CONVERSATIONS WHEREIN APT NATURALISTICALLY EMERGED, WE IDENTIFY 3 DISTINCT SELF-TO-DATA RELATIONSHIPS CONSTRUCTED VIA APT: ROLE-PLAY, PROJECTION, AND ORIENTATION. A FURTHER ANALYSIS EXPLORES HOW APT WAS EMBEDDED IN JOINT SENSEMAKING OF THE VISUALIZED DATA. TWELVE APT-MEDIATED SENSEMAKING PROCESSES ARE IDENTIFIED; TWO (EXTRAPOLATING AND NOTICING ABSENCE) WERE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MULTIPLE APT SELF-TO-DATA RELATIONSHIPS, WHILE THE REMAINING TEN (E.G., ENACTING, SPATIALLY CHARACTERIZING, GENERALIZING) WERE EXCLUSIVELY USED WITH SPECIFIC SELF-TO-DATA APT RELATIONSHIPS. WE USE THESE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS TO GENERATE HYPOTHESES ABOUT HOW APT AND ASSOCIATED SENSEMAKING PROCESSES MAY SUPPORT DATA SCIENCE LEARNING GOALS. © 2019, COPYRIGHT © 2019 TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP, LLC.","","","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, (1248052);

THESE NEW TRENDS IMPACT THE SOCIETY AND FUTURE JOBS, AND THUS STUDENT CAREERS. AT THE HEART OF THIS DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IS DATA SCIENCE, THE DISCIPLINE THAT MAKES SENSE OF BIG DATA. WITH MANY RAPIDLY EMERGING DIGITAL CHALLENGES AHEAD OF US, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES PERSPECTIVES ON ISCHOOLS' OPPORTUNITIES AND SUGGESTIONS IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION. WE ARGUE THAT ISCHOOLS SHOULD EMPOWER THEIR STUDENTS WITH ""INFORMATION COMPUTING""DISCIPLINES, WHICH WE DEFINE AS THE ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND CREATE VALUES, INFORMATION, AND KNOWLEDGE USING TOOLS IN APPLICATION DOMAINS. AS SPECIFIC APPROACHES TO ENFORCING INFORMATION COMPUTING DISCIPLINES IN DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION, WE SUGGEST THE THREE FOCI OF USER-BASED, TOOL-BASED, AND APPLICATION-BASED. THESE THREE FOCI WILL SERVE TO DIFFERENTIATE THE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION OF ISCHOOLS FROM THAT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE OR BUSINESS SCHOOLS. WE PRESENT A LAYERED DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION FRAMEWORK (DSEF) WITH BUILDING BLOCKS THAT INCLUDE THE THREE PILLARS OF DATA SCIENCE (PEOPLE, TECHNOLOGY, AND DATA), COMPUTATIONAL THINKING, DATA-DRIVEN PARADIGMS, AND DATA SCIENCE LIFECYCLES. DATA SCIENCE COURSES BUILT ON THE TOP OF THIS FRAMEWORK SHOULD THUS BE EXECUTED WITH USER-BASED, TOOL-BASED, AND APPLICATION-BASED APPROACHES. THIS FRAMEWORK WILL HELP OUR STUDENTS THINK ABOUT DATA SCIENCE PROBLEMS FROM THE BIG PICTURE PERSPECTIVE AND FOSTER APPROPRIATE PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS IN CONJUNCTION WITH BROAD PERSPECTIVES OF DATA SCIENCE LIFECYCLES.

HENCE, IT IS NECESSARY TO DESIGN EFFICIENT EDUCATION TECHNIQUES TO RAPIDLY TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF STUDENTS. WE DESCRIBE A HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT INTEGRATES MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES WITHIN A SINGLE SEMESTER COURSE TAUGHT AT THE FIRST YEAR LEVEL. THE OBJECTIVES INCLUDE BASIC DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, TEAMWORK, AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT. WE CONDUCTED A PROJECT THAT COMBINED DIFFERENT PUBLIC DATASETS RELATED TO THE COST AND QUALITY OF EDUCATION IN THE US. STUDENTS DEMONSTRATED A HIGH DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT IN THIS EXERCISE AS THEY WERE CURIOUS TO EXPLORE DATA THAT RELATED TO THEIR OWN COLLEGE SELECTION PROCESS. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO PERFORM A COST-QUALITY ANALYSIS IN THE FIELD OF COLLEGE EDUCATION.WE USED COLLEGE RANKING DATA CREATED BY THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, AND COMBINED IT WITH DATA FROM THE INTEGRATED POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION DATA SYSTEM DATABASE (HTTPS://NCES.ED.GOV/IPEDS/) THAT PROVIDED COLLEGE COSTS AND GRADUATION DATA. STUDENTS WORKED IN TEAMS TO DOWNLOAD SECTIONS OF THE DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, PERFORMED CLEANING AND VERIFICATION, AND MERGED THE DATA FOR ANALYSIS. THIS TAUGHT THEM THE VALUES OF TEAMWORK, GOAL-SETTING, AND PROCESS MEASUREMENT FOR TIMELY PROJECT COMPLETION.WE DETERMINED THAT THE PEARSON CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RANK OF A COLLEGE AND IN-STATE TUITION WAS-0.65 (P<0.005) FOR PRIVATE COLLEGES, AND-0.34 (P<0.005) FOR PUBLIC COLLEGES. THIS INDICATES THAT HIGHER RANKED COLLEGES TEND TO CHARGE HIGHER TUITION. THE PEARSON CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RANK OF ALL COLLEGES AND THEIR GRADUATION RATES IS-0.75 (P<0.005), AND BETWEEN RANK AND RETENTION RATES IS-0.71 (P<0.005). PRIVATE COLLEGE TUITION IS TYPICALLY $40,000 ANNUALLY, WHEREAS PUBLIC COLLEGES COST $20,000. THESE FIGURES SUGGEST THAT PUBLIC COLLEGES PROVIDE GOOD VALUE.

THE GROWING FIELD OF DATA SCIENCE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS MANY OF THESE NEEDS, PRIMARILY DUE TO RECENT EFFORTS TO COLLECT LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA RELATED TO SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND POLITICAL ISSUES. A CHALLENGE IS THAT THERE EXISTS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THESE REAL-WORLD ISSUES AND THE COURSE MATERIALS TAUGHT TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. THIS GAP IS DUE IN PART TO A LACK OF ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES AND THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, LEAVING STUDENTS WITH FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH DATASETS RELEVANT TO REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS.

THE ADOPTION OF DL IN HYDROLOGY HAS SO FAR BEEN GRADUAL, BUT THE FIELD IS NOW RIPE FOR BREAKTHROUGHS. THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT DL-BASED METHODS CAN OPEN UP A COMPLEMENTARY AVENUE TOWARD KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES. IN THE NEW AVENUE, MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHMS PRESENT COMPETING HYPOTHESES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH DATA. INTERROGATIVE METHODS ARE THEN INVOKED TO INTERPRET DL MODELS FOR SCIENTISTS TO FURTHER EVALUATE. HOWEVER, HYDROLOGY PRESENTS MANY CHALLENGES FOR DL METHODS, SUCH AS DATA LIMITATIONS, HETEROGENEITY AND CO-EVOLUTION, AND THE GENERAL INEXPERIENCE OF THE HYDROLOGIC FIELD WITH DL. THE ROADMAP TOWARD DL-POWERED SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES WILL REQUIRE THE COORDINATED EFFORT FROM A LARGE COMMUNITY INVOLVING SCIENTISTS AND CITIZENS. INTEGRATING PROCESS-BASED MODELS WITH DL MODELS WILL HELP ALLEVIATE DATA LIMITATIONS. THE SHARING OF DATA AND BASELINE MODELS WILL IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. OPEN COMPETITIONS COULD SERVE AS THE ORGANIZING EVENTS TO GREATLY PROPEL GROWTH AND NURTURE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION IN HYDROLOGY, WHICH DEMANDS A GRASSROOTS COLLABORATION.

THROUGH INTERACTION ANALYSIS OF VIDEO DATA, WE IDENTIFIED TEN DATA WRANGLING PRACTICES AND DEVELOPED A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF THE DATA WRANGLING PROCESS THAT CONTAINS FOUR INTERRELATED RECURSIVE STAGES. THESE DATA WRANGLING PRACTICES AND THE PROCESS OF DATA WRANGLING ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND FOR SUPPORTING FUTURE DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES THAT FACILITATE LEARNING AND DISCUSSION ABOUT SCIENTIFIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC ISSUES.

HENCE, THIS CHAPTER ARGUES THAT, IN ITS INITIAL STAGES, DATA SCIENCE APPLICATIONS AND THE DATA SCIENCE DISCIPLINE ITSELF BE DEVELOPED INDUCTIVELY AND DEDUCTIVELY IN A VIRTUOUS CYCLE. THE VIRTUES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY VIRTUOUS CYCLE (AKA VIRTUOUS HARDWARESOFTWARE CYCLE, INTEL-MICROSOFT VIRTUOUS CYCLE) THAT BUILT THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY (NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, THE NEW GLOBAL ECOSYSTEM IN ADVANCED COMPUTING: IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. COMPETITIVENESS AND NATIONAL SECURITY. THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES PRESS, WASHINGTON, DC, 2012) WERE BEING GROUNDED IN REALITY AND BEING SELF-PERPETUATING-MORE POWERFUL HARDWARE ENABLED MORE POWERFUL SOFTWARE THAT REQUIRED MORE POWERFUL HARDWARE, ENABLING YET MORE POWERFUL SOFTWARE, AND SO FORTH. BEING GROUNDED IN REALITY-SOLVING GENUINE PROBLEMS AT SCALE-WAS CRITICAL TO ITS SUCCESS, AS IT WILL BE FOR DATA SCIENCE. WHILE IT LASTED, IT WAS SELF-PERPETUATING, DUE TO A CONSTANT FLOW OF INNOVATION, AND TO BENEFITTING ALL PARTICIPANTS-PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS, THE INDUSTRY, THE ECONOMY, AND SOCIETY. IT IS A WONDERFUL SUCCESS STORY FOR TWENTIETH CENTURY APPLIED SCIENCE. GIVEN THE SUCCESS OF VIRTUOUS CYCLES IN DEVELOPING MODERN TECHNOLOGY, VIRTUOUS CYCLES GROUNDED IN REALITY SHOULD BE USED TO DEVELOP DATA SCIENCE, DRIVEN BY THE WISDOM OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY PROVERB, NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION. THIS CHAPTER EXPLORES THIS HYPOTHESIS USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE EVOLUTION OF DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS. FOR THE APPLICATION OF DATA SCIENCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND VIRTUOUS, IT SHOULD BE GROUNDED IN A CYCLE THAT ENCOMPASSES INDUSTRY (I.E., REAL PROBLEMS), RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DELIVERY. THIS CHAPTER PROPOSES APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES AND LESSONS OF THE VIRTUOUS CYCLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA SCIENCE APPLICATIONS; TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DATA SCIENCE DISCIPLINE ITSELF, FOR EXAMPLE, A DATA SCIENCE METHOD; AND TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; ALL FOCUSING ON THE CRITICAL ROLE OF COLLABORATION IN DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT, THEREBY ADDRESSING THE DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES FACED BY THE MORE THAN 150 DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH INSTITUTES (DSRIS) WORLDWIDE.

THESE PROCESSES STRONGLY INFLUENCE THE ANALYTICAL METHODS THAT CAN BE APPLIED, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW THE RESULTS OF THOSE METHODS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED. IN THE PRESENT CHAPTER WE PROVIDE BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES FOR DATA SCIENTISTS AND REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF A WORKSHOP WHERE EXPERTS FROM THE INFORMATION FIELD BRAINSTORMED ON THE EDUCATIONAL DIMENSIONS OF DATA SCIENCE. RESULTS OF THE WORKSHOP SHOWED THAT DATA SCIENTISTS MUST POSSESS A BREADTH OF EXPERTISE ACROSS THREE AREAS - CURATION, ANALYTICS, AND CYBER-INFRASTRUCTURE - WITH DEEP KNOWLEDGE IN AT LEAST ONE OF THESE AREAS. WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS ALSO UNDERSCORED THE IMPORTANCE OF DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE DATA SCIENCE ROLE.

IT IS ESSENTIAL THEY LEARN BY WORKING ON ASSIGNMENTS THAT INVOLVE REAL WORLD DATA SETS TO DEVELOP THE SKILLS NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE WORKPLACE. HOWEVER, ENABLING INSTRUCTORS TO FLEXIBLY DELIVER ALL KINDS OF DATA SCIENCE ASSIGNMENTS USING REAL WORLD DATA SETS TO LARGE NUMBERS OF LEARNERS (BOTH ON-CAMPUS AND OFF-CAMPUS) AT LOW COST IS A SIGNIFICANT OPEN CHALLENGE. TO ADDRESS THIS EMERGING CHALLENGE GENERALLY, WE DEVELOP AND DEPLOY A NOVEL CLOUD-BASED LAB FOR DATA SCIENCE (CLADS) TO ENABLE MANY LEARNERS AROUND THE WORLD TO WORK ON REAL-WORLD DATA SCIENCE PROBLEMS WITHOUT HAVING TO MOVE OR OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTE PROHIBITIVELY LARGE DATA SETS. LEVERAGING VERSION CONTROL AND CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION, CLADS PROVIDES A GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE ANY INSTRUCTOR TO CONVENIENTLY DELIVER ANY HANDS-ON DATA SCIENCE ASSIGNMENT THAT USES LARGE REAL WORLD DATA SETS TO AS MANY LEARNERS AS OUR CLOUD-COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE ALLOWS AT VERY LOW COST. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CLADS AND DISCUSS OUR EXPERIENCE WITH USING CLADS TO DEPLOY SEVEN MAJOR TEXT DATA ASSIGNMENTS FOR STUDENTS IN BOTH AN ON-CAMPUS COURSE AND AN ONLINE COURSE TO WORK ON FOR LEARNING ABOUT TEXT DATA RETRIEVAL AND MINING TECHNIQUES; THIS SHOWS THAT CLADS IS A VERY PROMISING NOVEL GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EFFICIENTLY DELIVERING A WIDE RANGE OF HANDS-ON DATA SCIENCE ASSIGNMENTS TO A LARGE NUMBER OF LEARNERS AT VERY LOW COST.","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION; CLOUD COMPUTING; VIRTUAL LAB",NA,"NSF GRFP [DGE-1144245]; NSF RESEARCH PROGRAM [IIS-1629161]; MICROSOFT AZURE; INTEL UNDER ITS SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR BIG DATA EDUCATION","THIS MATERIAL IS BASED UPON WORK SUPPORTED BY THE NSF GRFP UNDER GRANT NUMBER DGE-1144245, BY THE NSF RESEARCH PROGRAM UNDER GRANT NUMBER IIS-1629161, BY MICROSOFT AZURE, AND BY A GIFT FUND FROM INTEL UNDER ITS SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR BIG DATA EDUCATION.","ANONYMOUS, 2015, INT C MACHINE LEARNI;BECK K., 2004, EXTREME PROGRAMMING EXPLAINED;EISENSTEIN J., 2010, EMNLP, P1277;FANG H, 2014, SIGIR'14: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 37TH INTERNATIONAL ACM SIGIR CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, P1249, DOI 10.1145/2600428.2611178;FANG H, 2014, AAAI CONF ARTIF INTE, P30;FITZGERALD B, 2017, J SYST SOFTWARE, V123, P176, DOI 10.1016/J.JSS.2015.06.063;GONZALEZ-MARTINEZ JA, 2015, COMPUT EDUC, V80, P132, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2014.08.017;JOY MIKE., 2005, J ED RESOURCES COMPU, V5, P2;LOPEZ A., 2013, TACL, V1, P165;MASSUNG S, 2016, PROCEEDINGS OF 54TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS (ACL-2016): SYSTEM DEMONSTRATIONS, P91;MATTHIES CHRISTOPH., 2017, 2017 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE), P1, DOI DOI 10.1109/FIE.2017.8190589;NGUYEN A, 2014, WWW'14: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WORLD WIDE WEB, P491, DOI 10.1145/2566486.2568023;SRIKANT S, 2014, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 20TH ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING (KDD'14), P1887, DOI 10.1145/2623330.2623377;STAUBITZ T, 2016, IEEE GLOB ENG EDUC C, P314, DOI 10.1109/EDUCON.2016.7474573","GEIGLE, C (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ILLINOIS, URBANA, IL 61801 USA.","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","ENGLISH",NA,"PROCEEDINGS PAPER","BRONZE","ISI","WOS:000543991900049","ITICSE'18: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD ANNUAL ACM CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION","UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA-CHAMPAIGN","UNIV ILLINOIS",NA,"GEIGLE C, 2018, ITICSE'18: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD ANNUAL ACM CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION","GEIGLE C, 2018, ITICSE'18: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD ANNUAL ACM CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION"

BACKGROUND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED APPRECIATION OF DATA AS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY STRATEGIC RE-SOURCE. THIS HAS RESULTED IN A GREATER NEED FOR SKILLS IN DATA SCIENCE TO EXTRACT MEANINGFUL INSIGHTS FROM DATA. HOWEVER, THE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR DATA SCIENCE SKILLS. WHILE THERE IS GROWTH IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS, THEY APPEAR MORE AS A REBRANDING OF EXISTING ENGINEERING, COMPUTER SCIENCE, MATHEMATICS, AND STATISTICS PROGRAMS. METHODOLOGY A SCOPING REVIEW WAS ADOPTED FOR THE PERIOD 2010-2021 USING SIX SCHOLARLY MULTIDISCIPLINARY DATABASES: GOOGLE SCHOLAR, IEEE XPLORE, ACM DIGITAL LI-BRARY, SCIENCEDIRECT, SCOPUS, AND THE AIS BASKET OF EIGHT JOURNALS. THE STUDY WAS NARROWED DOWN TO 91 RESEARCH ARTICLES AND ADOPTED A CLASSIFICATION CODING FRAMEWORK AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS FOR ANALYSIS. CONTRIBUTION WE THEORETICALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWING BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE NEED TO SCALE UP DATA SCIENCE THROUGH MULTIDISCIPLINARY PEDAGOGIES AND DISCIPLINES AS THE DEMAND GROWS. THIS PAVES THE WAY FOR FUTURE RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND WHICH PROGRAMS CAN PROVIDE CURRENT AND FUTURE DATA SCIENTISTS THE SKILLS AND COMPE-TENCIES RELEVANT TO SOCIETAL NEEDS. FINDINGS THE KEY RESULTS REVEALED THE LIMITED EMPHASIS ON DSE, ESPECIALLY IN NON-STEM (SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS) DISCIPLINES. IN ADDITION, THE RESULTS IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO FIND A SUITABLE PEDAGOGY OR A SET OF PEDAGOGIES BECAUSE OF THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY NATURE OF DSE. FURTHER, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO EXISTING FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF DSE AT VARIOUS ED-UCATION LEVELS, LEADING TO SOMETIMES INADEQUATE PROGRAMS. THE STUDY ALSO NOTED THE IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS DSE AND THUS CREATE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE DSE ECOSYSTEM. MOST OF THE RESEARCH STUDIES REVIEWED WERE CASE STUDIES THAT PRESENTED MORE STEM PROGRAMS AS COMPARED TO NON-STEM. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCHERS WE RECOMMEND CROSS INDUSTRY STANDARD PROCESS FOR DATA MINING (CRISP -DM) AS A FRAMEWORK TO ADOPT COLLABORATIVE PEDAGOGIES TO TEACH DATA SCIENCE. THIS RESEARCH IMPLIES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ACADEMIA, POLICYMAKERS, AND DATA SCIENCE CONTENT DEVELOPERS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH ORGANIZATIONS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS. WE RECOMMEND FUTURE RESEARCH INTO PROGRAMS THAT CAN PROVIDE CURRENT AND FU-TURE DATA SCIENTISTS THE SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES RELEVANT TO SOCIETAL NEEDS AND HOW INTERDISCIPLINARITY WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE INTEGRATED. IMPACT ON SOCIETY DATA SCIENCE EXPERTISE IS ESSENTIAL FOR TACKLING SOCIETAL ISSUES AND GENERATING BENEFICIAL EFFECTS. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT DATA IS DIVERSE AND ALWAYS CHANGING, NECESSITATING ONGOING (UP)SKILLING. ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS MUST THEREFORE STAY CURRENT WITH NEW ADVANCES, CHANGING DATA, AND ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. IN-DUSTRY EXPERTS MIGHT SHARE VIEWS BASED ON THEIR PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE. THE DSE ECOSYSTEM CAN BE SHAPED BY COLLABORATING WITH NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS AND BE-ING AWARE OF EACH STAKEHOLDER'S FUNCTION IN ORDER TO ADVANCE DATA SCIENCE INTER-NATIONALLY. FUTURE RESEARCH THE STUDY FOUND THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES THAT CAN BE EXPLORED TO IMPROVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DSE, FOR INSTANCE, HOW CAN CRISP -DM BE INTEGRATED INTO COLLABORATIVE PEDAGOGIES TO PROVIDE A FULLY COMPREHEN-SIVE DATA SCIENCE CURRICULUM?","DATA SCIENCE APPLICATIONS IN EDUCATION; PEDAGOGY; TEACHING; LEARNING STRATEGIES; TRANSDISCIPLINARY PROJECTS; DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION","BIG DATA; REQUIREMENTS; BUSINESS",NA,NA,"ANDERSON PAUL E., 2014, 2014 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE).

MANY EARLY EFFORTS AT DEFINING CURRICULA AND COURSES EXIST, WITH THE EDISON PROJECT'S DATA SCIENCE FRAME-WORK (EDISON-DSF) FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION BEING THE MOST COMPLETE. THE EDISON-DSF INCLUDES BOTH A DATA SCIENCE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE (DS-BOK) AND COMPETENCY FRAMEWORK (CF-DS).

THEREFORE, IT IS CRUCIAL TO EXTEND FAMILIARITY WITH CLASSIFICATION METHODS TO NON-STEM STUDENTS, WHO WILL ENCOUNTER SUCH PROBLEMS IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL CAREERS. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A DATA SCIENCE COURSE FOR NON-STEM STUDENTS ON CLASSIFICATION METHODS. THE COURSE'S DIFFICULTY LEVEL IS INFLUENCED BY FACTORS SUCH AS STUDENTS' BACKGROUNDS AND THE PREREQUISITES AND REQUIREMENTS SET BY THE OFFERING DEPARTMENT. THE SUGGESTED COURSE FRAMEWORK BEGINS WITH DATA PREPARATION AND PROVIDES STUDENTS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE TOOLBOX COMPRISING METHODICAL TECHNIQUES AND SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR CLASSIFICATION. THIS COURSE GUIDES STUDENTS TOWARD DISCOVERING NEW KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHTS ABOUT CLASSIFICATION AND INTERPRETATION. THE TEACHING APPROACH EMPHASIZES THE DYNAMIC PROCESS INVOLVED IN CLASSIFICATION, ENCOMPASSING GRASPING THE ANALYTICAL TASK, UNDERSTANDING TERMS AND CONCEPTS, VISUALIZING THE CLASSIFICATION, ANALYZING DATA, INTERPRETING RESULTS, AND DRAWING CONCLUSIONS. THIS COURSE ALSO COMBINES PROJECT-BASED LEARNING, OPEN DISCUSSIONS, AND EVEN COMPETITIONS AMONG CLASS PARTICIPANTS.

THE MODEL OF THE QUANTIFIED SELF-IN WHICH DATA ABOUT ONE'S OWN ACTIVITIES ARE COLLECTED AND MADE INTO OBJECTS OF STUDY-PROVIDES INSPIRATION FOR ONE SUCH APPROACH. BY DRAWING ON WHAT ONE ALREADY KNOWS ABOUT THEIR SELF AND THEIR PRIOR EXPERIENCES, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO BOOTSTRAP STUDENTS' ABILITIES TO INTERPRET AND MAKE SENSE OF DATA. TAKING THAT POSSIBILITY SERIOUSLY, THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES SOME OF THE GAINS OBSERVED IN STUDENTS' STATISTICAL REASONING FOLLOWING A QUANTIFIED SELF, WEARABLES-BASED ELEMENTARY STATISTICS UNIT AND PROVIDES A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK DRAWING FROM COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY, EMBODIMENT, AND SITUATIVE PERSPECTIVES TO CHARACTERIZE HOW PRIOR EXPERIENCE IS USED AS A RESOURCE IN DATA SENSE-MAKING WHEN THE DATA ARE ABOUT STUDENTS' OWN PHYSICAL EXPERIENCES. THIS FRAMEWORK CENTRALIZES AND INTERROGATES THE WORK OF ""REMEMBERING"" PRIOR EXPERIENCES AND ARTICULATES HOW REMEMBERING IS INVOLVED IN INTERPRETING QUANTIFIED SELF DATA. SPECIFICALLY, THE FRAMEWORK EMPHASIZES THAT REMEMBERING IN SERVICE OF DATA INTERPRETATION IS A RECONSTRUCTIVE ACT THAT DRAWS FROM BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIFIC EMBODIED RESOURCES AND THAT THE WORK OF RECONSTRUCTIVE REMEMBERING IN THE CLASSROOM IS BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND MULTI-PARTICIPANT WORK. TO DEMONSTRATE MEASURED LEARNING GAINS AND ILLUSTRATE THE FRAMEWORK, WRITTEN ASSESSMENT RESULTS AND DESCRIPTIVE CASES OF STUDENT AND TEACHER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT QUANTIFIED SELF DATA FROM TWO SIXTH-GRADE CLASSES PARTICIPATING IN A CLASSROOM DESIGN EXPERIMENT ARE PROVIDED.
